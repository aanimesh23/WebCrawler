Accountable Storage
</h1>
<h2>
Roberto Tamassia, Brown University
</h2>

<p>
We introduce accountable storage, a framework allowing a client with small local space to
outsource file blocks to an untrusted server and be able (at any point in time after
outsourcing) to provably compute how many bits have been discarded by the server. In case
of data loss, the client can be compensated with a dollar amount proportional to the
damage that has occurred. Our technique is based on an extension of invertible Bloom
filters, a data structure used to quickly compute the distance between two sets. Also, we
show how our protocol can be integrated with Bitcoin to support an automatic compensation
scheme.
<p>
Joint work with Giuseppe Ateniese, Michael T. Goodrich, Vassilios Lekakis, Charalampos
Papamanthou and Evripidis Paraskevas.
