<H2>Setting Rivendell 0.6 in the CLASSPATH on Solaris</H2>

<p>&nbsp;
This section provides an example of how to set up your downloaded Rivendell 0.6
to be included it in the CLASSPATH environment variable.  CLASSPATH is the
environment used by the Java interpretor (JVM) to look for Java byte-code.
</p>

<p> Note: the tcsh shell was used for this example.</p>

<H3> Appending the CLASSPATH to include the Rivendell byte-code files</H3>

<p> After you have uncompressed and un-tared the downloaded Rivendell
file, you
will need to include its .class files 
in your CLASSPATH environment variable.  
</p>

<p> You may use any technique you like to set the CLASSPATH.  In this 
example, we are using the setenv command to append the CLASSPATH.
The command will look like this:
<br>
<tt>setenv CLASSPATH $CLASSPATH':<i>path_to_rivendell</i>'</tt>
<br>
Note: the ' quotes the string :path_to_rivendell so that tcsh won't
interpret the colon :.

<p> Note: The CLASSPATH is set to point to the directory above the
rivendell and psl directories where their classes reside.  
Also remember that Rivendell uses HTTPClient which you will need to download. 
You need to include HTTPClient in your CLASSPATH as well.
</p>

<p> You now have Rivendell installed so that your Java interpretor can 
use it to run Chimera 2.0.
