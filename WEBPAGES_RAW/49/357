<FONT SIZE=2>Objective</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Seeking full-time tenure-track opportunity
as faculty member in software engineering, specifically development
of complex software including object-oriented systems, data mining,
and intelligent agents.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Summary of qualifications</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>I have been a software developer since 1983, a teacher
and instructor since 1986, a researcher since 1988, and a consultant
and mentor since 1993.  My professional expertise is in development
of complex software systems, including object-oriented (OO) analysis
and design methods (Booch, Rumbaugh), OO programming languages
(C++, Ada), and the corresponding development tools (Visual C++,
Rational Rose, Select OMT, Ada compilers).  I am also proficient
with Microsoft technologies including Windows 95/NT, MFC 4.x,
and COM/OLE programming.  My research experience includes all
aspects of the software development lifecycle, as well as software
process modeling, software understanding, software visualization,
hypertext and hypermedia.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>My teaching experience includes close to 1,000 computer
professionals in Southern California trained in OO Analysis and
Design methods and Microsoft Windows programming using Visual
C++ and MFC.  Currently I am consulting and mentoring in object-oriented
software development to Beckman Instruments, a Fortune 500 company
in Fullerton CA, and to ObjectAutomation, a promising start-up
in Irvine CA.</FONT>
