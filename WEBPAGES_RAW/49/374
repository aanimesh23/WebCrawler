<H2>Computer Aided Manufacturing</H2></A>

Computer aided manufacturing concerns the use of algorithms
for planning and controlling fabrication processes.
These algorithms are also important to <A HREF="cad.html">computer aided
design</A>, since it is important to be able to test manufacturability
as part of the design process.  Specific areas of computer aided manufacturing listed as separate topics here include
<A HREF="grasp.html">grasping and fixturing</A>,
<A HREF="metro.html">metrology</A>,
<A HREF="robot.html">robot motion planning</A>,
and <A HREF="textile.html">textile layout</A>.

<LI>An geometry problem arising in a special case
of manufacturing
concerns forming parts out of folded
sheet metal -- one must unfold the part
to a flat surface that does not overlap itself.  This can always
be done for convex polyhedra if one can cut faces, but it is open
whether one need only use cuts along edges.
<A HREF="http://www.paxar.bc.ca/paxar/touch3D.html">Touch-3d</A> is commercial software for making unfolded models for rapid prototyping; according to MacUser
(Jul '97 p.52), "components often overlap" requiring extensive user
interaction, so they need better unfolding algorithms!
