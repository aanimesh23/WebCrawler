"<b>Sharpening the Bounds on Time Between Events in Maximally Parallel 
Systems</b>"</A>,
by George S. Avrunin in Technical Report 92-069,
Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1992.

<H2> Abstract </H2>

A recent paper by Avrunin, Corbett, Dillon, and Wileden describes a method 
for obtaining bounds on the time that can elapse between two given events 
in an execution of a concurrent software system running on a single 
processor under arbitrary scheduling. The technique involves generating 
linear inequalities expressing conditions that must be satisfied by all 
executions of such a system and using integer programming methods to find 
appropriate solutions to the inequalities. Corbett has extended this approach 
to obtain upper bounds on the time between events in executions of 
multi-processor concurrent systems in which each process proceeds unless 
forced to wait to communicate with another, the case of maximal parallelism, 
and processes communicate by synchronous message passing. Corbett's method 
does not strictly enforce the maximal parallelism assumption, however, 
and may thus give poor (though valid) bounds in some cases. In this paper, 
I show how to modify Corbett's method to obtain sharper bounds.
