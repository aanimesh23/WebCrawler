ICS 160E / EECS 114 - Algorithms Assignments</h1>

<p>
<h4>
Spring, 2005

</center>

<p>
<b>Notes:</b> 
<ol>
<li>Group work on written homeworks is permitted, but each
student <b>must</b> list his or her collaborators in writing for each problem.
If a student turns in a solution without listing
the others who helped produce this solution,
this act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).
<li>
Programming projects must be 100% <b>individual</b> efforts.
Submitted code will be subjected to a rigorous similarity checking
system at UC-Berkeley, 
known as <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~aiken/moss.html">MOSS</a>,
and non-negligible similarities between different student submissions
will be considered as cheating for both students (so don't even show
your code to other students).
In addition to the procedures of the
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html">ICS 
Cheating Policy</a>, students caught cheating on programming projects
will have
a letter placed in their permanent record at UCI
and, at a minimum, receive a score of zero points on the work in question.
