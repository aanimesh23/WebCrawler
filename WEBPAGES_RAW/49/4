<h1>
Algorithmic Complexity of Power Law Networks
</h1>
<h2>
Timothy Johnson
</h2>

<p>It was experimentally observed that the majority of real-world networks
are scale-free and follow power law degree distribution. The aim of this
paper is to study the algorithmic complexity of such &ldquo;typical&rdquo;
networks. The contribution of this work is twofold.</p>

<p>First, we define a deterministic condition for checking whether a graph
has a power law degree distribution and experimentally validate it on
real-world networks. This definition allows us to derive interesting
properties of power law networks.</p>

<p>Secondly, we give a novel theoretical explanation why many algorithms
run faster on real-world data than what is predicted by algorithmic
worst-case analysis. We show how to exploit the power law degree
distribution to design faster algorithms for a number of classic
$\mathsf{P}$-time
problems including transitive closure, maximum matching, determinant,
PageRank and matrix inverse. Moreover, we deal with the problems of
counting triangles and finding maximum clique.</p>

<p>In contrast to previously done average-case analyses, we believe that
this is the first &ldquo;waterproof&rdquo; argument that explains why many
real-world networks are easier.</p>
