At the Northern California Section of the MAA meeting this past
weekend, John Ewing gave an interesting talk called "Can We See the
Mandlebrot Set".  (He avoided using both the "C" word and the "F" word
after the introduction to the talk.  It was not about either chaos or
fractals, but about what the M set is, mathematically.)  Anyway, he
discussed two results which we've seen separately in this group in the
last month or so.  Namely, that by computing the area of the M-set
using lots of terms in a series (Laurent Series?), the upper bound of
the area seems to converge about at 1.72 (the graph gets quite flat,
and seems to have an asymptote there), and by counting pixals more and
more accurately, you seem to get a lower bound of very close to 1.52.
Both these bounds are close to the values the methods would produce in
the limit - that is, it is NOT the case that these numbers would get
closer if a finer grid were used, or more terms were taken in the
series.  So, why the difference of 10% or so?  No one knows.  One
possibility is that the pixal method misses "hairs" around the border.
(I know thats not described very well; it was late, and I wasn't
taking notes.)  There was also a vague theory for the higher number
being possibly wrong.  But basically, it is not known, at present,
which of these numbers represents the "real" area (although it is
believed that one of them does.)  I'm afraid he didn't give references
(I asked afterwards.)

I know almost nothing about this, but see an article by Ewing and Schober,
something like "On the Coefficients of the Reciprocal of the Mandelbrot Set"
in "Mathematical Analysis and Applications". It seems the area of the Mandel-
brot set is bounded above by 

         Infinity
pi*( 1 - Sum      n* b(n)^2  )
         n=1

where b(n) are the coefficients of the power series mapping the unit circle
to the exterior of the Mandelbrot set. It converges very slowly (the 
terms of the series are very irregular, can be found recursively, and
asymptotically behave as O(n^(-5/4) ). I believe that adding a quarter 
million terms yields an area approximately of 1.72  (1.75? something like
that); this is interesting because huge scale Monte Carlo runs bound the
area at about 1.53 (or thereabouts). I've tried accelerating the power series
based on the first 20 or so terms, but haven't had any luck.

As for the centroid question...the centroid is the center of area, right?
If so, it'll be on the real axis (Mandelbrot is symmetric), and can be ap-
proximated roughly by finding the "center of mass" of the big cardioid, 
big circle, and the two largish (above/below the cardioid) bulbs all 
together.

Take all this cautiously. If anyone's interested, let me know and I'll
dig out a more complete reference list and post it here (these were the 
highlights).

Ah, the old MSet area problem. I compute the area is at least 1.505936.

Three years ago a bunch of us (66) who read sci.fractals computed upper 
and lower bounds. We found it is more than 1.5031197 and no greater than 
1.5613027. See Y. Fisher and J. Hill, Bounding the Area of the Mandelbrot

It's somewhere around -0.288, by straight Monte Carlo. The area is about
1.52, by the same argument.

  Another approach might be to find the centroids (or areas, or whatever)
of the various iterates of z^2 + c.  Is there an analytic technique to
determine the centroid of such a figure (defined by |p(c)| == 2 for some
polynomial p)?  Is the desired centroid the limit of the resulting sequence?

I have continued to compute the area of the Mandelbrot Set using
my method of averaging 20 runs by the pixel-counting method,
with slightly different grid placements and grid spacings. The
latest result (after about 3.7 trillion Mandelbrot iterations)
is 1.50659230 +- 0.0000006.

Here are the results of a set of such averaged runs. For each
grid size, 20 runs were computed and averaged together.

The standard deviation measures how much (on average) each
run differs from the average. This means that the average
itself almost certainly varys even less from the true area.
For 20 samples, the standard error of the mean is about 0.23
of the standard deviation. A safe estimate of the error
would be about 1/3 of the standard deiation.

(My old estimate, from April 13th 1993, was 1.506595
+- 0.000002. That estimate was based on an average of 40
runs, and used a dwell limit of 524288. I should have
subtracted 0.000005 to account for the error in using such
a low dwell limit; I also was a little too "liberal" in my
calculation of the expected error.)

The area of the Mandelbrot set is 

    A = (1 - sum (n=1 to infinity) n (b_n)^2) Pi

or approximately 2.089.

Here the numbers  b_n  are the coeffients of the Laurent series about
infinity of the conformal map  psi  of the exterior of the unit disk
onto the exterior of the Mandelbrot set:

  psi(w) = w +  sum (n=0 to infinity)  b_n w^(-n)
  
         = w - (1/2) + (1/8) w^(-1) - (1/4) w^(-2) + (15/128) w^(-3)
                 
           + 0 w^(-4) - (47/1024) w^(-5) + ...
                 
These coefficients can be computed recursively, but a closed form
is not known.  The above approximation comes from using the first

A formula for computing the area of the Mandelbrot set was discussed on
this newsgroup recently.  Gerald Edgar posted an area estimate based on
72 terms.  Yuval Fisher pointed out that a 256-term estimate gives a
much lower value, and he described how to compute coefficients in the area
series.

Using Yuval's suggestion, I computed over 100,000 terms of the series.
The estimate converges very slowly -- a summary appears below.  An
inportant point is that every truncation of the series is an 
*upper bound* on the area of M.  Based on the trend I'd say the true 
area is probably less than 1.70, but I won't bet my firstborn on that.

At the Northern California Section of the MAA meeting this past
weekend, John Ewing gave an interesting talk called "Can We See the
Mandlebrot Set".  (He avoided using both the "C" word and the "F" word
after the introduction to the talk.  It was not about either chaos or
fractals, but about what the M set is, mathematically.)  Anyway, he
discussed two results which we've seen separately in this group in the
last month or so.  Namely, that by computing the area of the M-set
using lots of terms in a series (Laurent Series?), the upper bound of
the area seems to converge about at 1.72 (the graph gets quite flat,
and seems to have an asymptote there), and by counting pixals more and
more accurately, you seem to get a lower bound of very close to 1.52.
Both these bounds are close to the values the methods would produce in
the limit - that is, it is NOT the case that these numbers would get
closer if a finer grid were used, or more terms were taken in the
series.  So, why the difference of 10% or so?  No one knows.  One
possibility is that the pixal method misses "hairs" around the border.
(I know thats not described very well; it was late, and I wasn't
taking notes.)  There was also a vague theory for the higher number
being possibly wrong.  But basically, it is not known, at present,
which of these numbers represents the "real" area (although it is
believed that one of them does.)  I'm afraid he didn't give references
(I asked afterwards.)

There was some discussion a while back about the area of the
Mandelbrot set.  I just noticed the following article:

        J. H. Ewing and G. Schober, The area of the Mandelbrot set,
        Numer. Math. 61 (1992), 59-72.

It may be of interest.

The article computes the area estimate using 240,000 terms.  The result
is 1.7274...  The behovior of the approximations suggests that the limit
is between 1.66 and 1.71.  However, the estimates of the area from below,
using pixel counting show that the area is at least 1.52.  The large
gap between the lower bound 1.52 and the upper bound 1.71 may possibly
be an indication that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set has
positive area...

The Ewing and Schober paper cited also explains the computation of
the coefficients b_m in the series.

  I have done some refined pixel counting and
my best result is
 Total Mset area=  1.499936.
On this basis I conjecture that the exact value is 3/2.
However, this number is not universal in the way that the feigenvalues are,
since it varies with reparameterization of the map z^2+c.   I have also
done z^d+c (d=3,4,5..), with no clear pattern yet.

          My Mandelbrot Flower

              (-:  ---  ;^)

So let's get started. We can for each period, p, count around
the Cardioid.  Let's name the buds (i,p), the i-th bud with
period p.

n:=0;
for p:=1 to inf do
  for i:=1 to p do
    n:=n+1;

But we find we already counted some. For example, (2,4) is
the same bud as (1,2).  The modified loop is

n:=0; m:=0;
for p:=1 to inf do
  for i:=1 to p do
    if gcd(i,p)=1 then
      n:=n+1
    else
      m:=m+1;

where m will count the duplicates. To count the buds on buds,
we must make this algorithm recursive. When we are done, we
can also count the island Mandelbroties, l. They will be

l = 2^p - (n+m) - Mandelbrotie buds.

Table I shows the results of this calculation.  We can also
keep a running total of the number of buds.  The total for
each doubling of the period is shown in Table II.  The last
column shows the ratio of the total with each doubling which
approaches 5.56.  An approximate formula for the total is

  Total buds, T = 5.56^(ln2(p/2)) = 5.56^(-1+1.442695*ln(p))
                = exp( 2.46*ln(p)-1.7 )

The density of buds is approximately

  dT/dp = (0.45/p)*exp( 2.46*ln(p) )

Now if we use Milnor's bud radius formula r=sin(pi*i/p)/(p*p),
we can estimate the area of the Cardioid plus attached buds.
The formula is not good for buds on buds, however if I use it
anyway, the area approaches 1.507818.  I must point out the
formula is quite inaccurate, with error as large as 100%.
Therefore, measured radii for p less than 11 were substituted
in the revised area estimate, Table III, which approaches
1.504106.  This is approximate since the bud radii (area) for
periods beyond 2 are still unknown.

The importance of the bud area as a function of p can be
gauged the total area of all buds and cardioids as a function
of p.  An estimate based on 'pixel counting' is shown in Table
IV.  The values for p=1,2 can be compared to the exact values.

A(1) = 3*pi/8 = 1.178097245 (calculated=1.17809694),

A(2) =  pi/16 = 0.196349541 (calculated=0.19634926).

Their error is about 3e-7.  The calculation used 8192x4096
samples in region (-2,-1.125),(0.5,1.125) with an iteration
limit of 8388608.  Period detection was used for early exit.
When a period was found, an additional set of iterations were
used with a fuzzy period test to distinguish the real period
from a multiple.  A simultaneous graphic display showed the
errors in the period selection to be very few.  The undecideds
after 8388608 iterations were counted.  Only 73 samples out
of 8987185 were unable to decide to exit or find a period.
We can see from Table IV that accurate estimates of bud radii
will be needed up to p=48 if we want 5 or 6 digit accuracy.
That is 2417 buds on the main Mandelbrot, not an impossible
task.  8^)   |-0   &gt;^]   |-(  (Are we having fun yet?)  ;^)

Recently I restarted the computing effort I undertook
about a year ago to
compute the area of the Mandelbrot
Set. After reviewing the notes from that
time I saw that there had
been some interest in the past of computing the
Mandelbrot Set's
"center of gravity" as well. I have also done some
optimizations of
the code in the mean time and fixed a few bugs, and have
started
doing a long run.

The method I use involves counting pixels on a
grid. There is error
in the estimate resulting from grid placement and the
fact that the
grid squares on the boundary get counted as completely in or
completely out when in fact only part of their area is in. It is hard
to
estimate the magnitude of this error, so I use statistical methods
to measure
it. I use a bunch of grids of slightly different grid
spacings with slight
vertical and horizontal offsets, and take the
mean and standard deviation of
all the runs.

These are the figures I've compiled so far. Each run is the
average
of 20 grids for which the standard deviations are shown.

For each average, the standard deviation gives the expected error
in
each of the 20 individual grids. The expected error of the mean
is 1/sqrt(19)
of the standard deviation (this is called "the standard
error of the mean").
I use 1/3 as a conservative estimate. So, my
best estimate of the
center-of-gravity is -0.28676832 +- 0.00000010.
For the area, we have
1.50659173 +- 0.00000020.

The Inverse Symbolic Calculator is a resource at
the URL

  <A HREF="http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/projects/ISC/ISCmain.html">http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/projects/ISC/ISCmain.html</A>

which can be
used to guess what expression produces a given numeric
value. I plugged in
the values 1.50659173 and 0.28676832. I saw
nothing interesting for the area
but for the center of gravity it
gives

  -((ln(3)-1/3) ^ Feig1).

Feig1 is
the larger Faigenbaum constant, whose value is
4.6692016091029906718532038,
and shows up in the Mandelbrot Set as
the ratio of the radii of successive
mu-atoms on the real axis.
Plugging in this value we get the following
hypothetical precise
value of the Mandelbrot Set's center of gravity:

-0.2867682633829350268529586

A few other observations:

- My program
currently runs at about 2.39 million Mandelbrot iterations
  per second (each
iteration requires 7 floating-point operations).
  The latest model Macs are
about 4 times faster. Intel machines get
  nowhere close because they don't
have enough floating-point registers
  to keep the pipeline full.

- Each
time I double the grid size it takes almost 4.7 times as long.
  The current
rate of progress in computer performance is
  about 1.56 per year; at that
rate it takes about 3.5 years
        to increase computing power by 4.7.

- Each
time the gridsize is doubled the error goes down to about 0.4
        of the
previous value (but it varies from 0.3 to 0.55). It would take
  about 8 to
10 years for personal computers to improve enough to give
  us one more digit
in the area estimate (given the same run time).
