An Experimental Comparison of Force-Directed and Randomized Graph Drawing Algorithms
</h2>
<h2>
Authors: Franz J. Brandenburg, Michael Himsolt and Christoph Rohrer
</h2>

<p>
The authors report on experiments with fivegraph drawing algorithms 
for general undirected graphs. These are the algorithms FR introduced 
by Fruchterman and Reingold , KK by Kamada and Kawai , DH by Davidson 
and Harel , Tu by Tunkelang  and GEM by Frick, Ludwig and Mehldau. 
They tested these algorithms on a wide collection of examples and 
with different settings of parameters.  
Examples are from original papers and by their own.
