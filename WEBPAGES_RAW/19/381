	B-Trees: An Efficent Structure for Searching Data on External Memory


In this lecture we will examine one data structure and algorithm that is useful
when storing the data needs more space than is available in main memory. We
will analyze this algorithm with respect to how often it moves blocks of data
between main and external memory (discussed in the previous lecture). Typically
the cost of such memory transfers dominates the cost of executing code on the
block while it is in memory. That is, a transfer between main and external
memory might take 10 milliseconds, while processing the data in the block might
take microseconds (a few 1/1000ths of a millisecond) before making another
memory transfer. A processor executing 10^9 instructions per second can process
10^7 (10 million) instructions in 10 ms. So, we can virtually ignore the time
taken to process each block retrieved from memory, counting only the number of
transfers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Searching with B-Trees:

A B-Tree is special kind of N-ary Search Tree (NST - contrast to BST).

There are many different kinds of B-trees. We characterize each B-tree in terms
of it ORDER, b: each memory block stores b-1 keys and b pointers to children
(subtrees). For b = 5 -the example we will use here- we can visualize each node
in the tree as containing two arrays: the key array (storing the keys aka
values in the B-tree) and the subtree/children array, storing pointers to
children nodes, their roots in subtrees. We will use the familiar terminology
of root, internal node, and leaf to describe these trees.

For example, here is the data for one node in a B-tree of order 5: it has room
for 4 keys, 5 children.

            0   1   2   3
          +---+---+---+---+
key       |   |   |   |   |
          +---+---+---+---+
          0   1   2   3   4
        +---+---+---+---+---+
subtree |   |   |   |   |   |
        +---+---+---+---+---+

By the order property (see it below)
all values in subtree[0] are less than key[0]
all values in subtree[1] are greater than key[0] and less than key[1],
all values in subtree[2] are greater than key[1] and less than key[2],
all values in subtree[3] are greater than key[2] and less than key[3],
all values in subtree[4] are greater than key[3]

B-Trees have other properties (listed below): for example, their arrays don't
have to be filled, but all nodes except the root must be at least half filled
with respect to the number of child pointers they store (see the structure
property below).

Ultimately, b will be a large value, such that storing the arrays in the node
will take up the size of a large block easily readable from external storage 
(typically containing thousands of keys/subtree pointers). So, if it were
convenient to transfer blocks of 1,000 words of memory, we would choose b to
be 500, having 499 (b-1) keys and 500 (b) subtrees/children. It is not 
unreasonable to transfer blocks of 10K or even 100K or 1M words, because the
latency and bandwidth properties of external storage allow that much information
to be transferred quickly.

In the examples below, we will choose b to be 5. This b is big enough to be
interesting (and different than a Binary Search Tree) but small enough to cause
lots of node merges and splits when doing insertions and deletions: if b were
500, we would have to insert 500 values before we required a second block of
memory to be used.

We will now characterize the order and structure properties of B-trees

Order Property
  1) The keys in a node are sorted left to right, key[i]<key[i+1]
      (for simplicity, assume unique values).
  2) A subtree between key[i] and key[i+1] (see the picture above) contains
      values x such that key[i]<x<key[i+1]. For a leftmost subtree, it contains
      values x only such that x < key[0]; for a rightmost subtree k it contains
      values x such that x > key[k-1]

Structure Propery of B-trees of order b (5)
  1) All leaves are at the same depth and store their information as keys only
     (all the subtree pointers for leaves, of course, store nullptr, so this
      space gets wasted)
  2) Every non-leaf node with k keys contains k+1 children
     (leaf nodes contain, by definition, no children)
  3) Every node has at most b-1 keys (5-1=4)
  4) Every node except the root has >= b/2 (5/2 = 2) keys (it is at least 1/2
       full with respect to children pointers)
  5) The root may be empty and it may also be a leaf

Below is the psuedocode for searching for, inserting, and removing values in a
B-tree. Aside: I expect you to know (i.e., memorize) how to search and insert,
but not delete (which is a bit too complicated).

------------------------------

Searching for x in a node (start searching at the root):

Overview: Recall that all leaves are at the same depth (call it d). At most we
will look at d+1 nodes, each requiring tranfering one block of memory from the
external device to the main memory. Recall, the depth of the root is 0.

  If there is no root node, x is not in the tree
  If there is a root node
    Using the order property, do a "binary" search on the keys in the node
    (actually a (b)-ary search since each node has up to b children)
      a) if there is an i such that keys[i] = x, x is in the tree at this node
      b) otherwise, if x < key[0] search subtree with index 0
                    if keys[i] < x < keys[i+1] search the subtree at index i+1
                    if x > the last key[k] search the subtree with index k+1

*Note that we do a "binary" search on each B-Node block, which take a trivial
amount of time compared to bringing the block into memory. For a block of size
1000 (499 keys + 500 children pointers), it takes only 100s of instructions.

------------------------------

Insertion of x (assuming it is not already in the tree; for simplicity assume
unique values, as in sets and maps):

Overview: x will be added as a key/value in some leaf; if that leaf is already
full, it will split into two nodes, with one key/value propagating upward to
its parent. If the parent is full, it will split, .... Eventually a parent will
not be filled and accommodate the key, or a new root will be created,
increasing the height of the tree (and the depth of all the leaves) by 1. So
unlike BSTs (which grow from their leaves downward), B-Trees grow from their
roots upward.

  Search the tree to find in which LEAF x belongs

  If there is room in that leaf, put x in the key array at the correct index
    adjusting the children pointers as necessary
  If there is NO room for the key/value in the leaf (the node's keys are full)
    Find the median value among the values in the leaf, including the new value
    Using the median as the separator value, split the leaf into two new nodes
      (one with all values<median, one with all values>median)
    Insert the median in the parent's node adjusting the children (now 1 more)
      as necessary; if there is no room for the key/value in the parent
      split it using these same instructions

  It is possible, if this process goes back to a full root node, that the
  root node will itself need to split into two children of a newly created
  root, which will have just one value (allowed at the root by the structure
  property). So, unlike BSTs, B-trees grow at the root, not the leaves. This 
  ensures the property that all the leaves are at the same depth.

Note that because the median is inserted in the parent, the two children will
be well balanced, each containing half the values in the original leaf node
that was split (no matter what order they were inserted). Also, each split node
will be only 1/2 full, so it will have room to add more keys later, without
having to split immediately.

------------------------------

Deletion for x:

Overview 1: Deletion in a B-Tree is similar to deletion in a BST. Either the
value being deleted is in a leaf or it is in an internal node. If it is in a
leaf, it is deleted there (see Overview 2); if it is in an internal node, we
replace its value by the largest value smaller than x or the smallest value
bigger than x (that value will always be in a leaf) and delete this replacing
value from its leaf (see Overview 2).

Overview 2: To delete a value from a leaf we remove it; if it has enough keys/
values (remember the structure propoerty, part 4) we are done. If the leaf has
too few keys/values we try to borrow one from any of its adjacent siblings; if
we can (so the leaf and its sibling have the required minimum keys/values), we
are done. If not we REBALANCE the leaf with one of its adjacent siblings and a
value from its parent, possibly leading to more REBALANCE operations between the
parent, its adjacent siblings, and its parent....ultimately possibly removing
the root node and decreasing the height of the tree.

  Search the tree to find in which node x is present.
  If it is not present, "there is nothing left to do" (TINLTD)

  If the node containing x is is a LEAF
    remove x  from the keys/values
    if the node that contained x is also the root, or
       the # of keys/values is still >= b/2: TINLTD

    if the # of keys/values is now < b/2 and the node is not the root, we say
      the node with  x removed "deficient" (it doesn't have >= b/2 values);
      perform the code labeled "REBALANCE" below, which will restore a
      deficient node but possible make its parent deficient (if so, requiring
      REBLANCE to be called on it), possibly processing nodes all the way
      up to the root.

  If the node containing x is an INTERNAL NODE (not a leaf)
    replace x by an "extremal" value (largest value in the left subtree or
      smallest value in the right subtree) and then remove that value (which
      is in a LEAF by the rules above).


REBALANCE: A deficient node (DN) has < b/2 values

Below is the "rebalance" code when deleting x from a node that becomes
deficient. This code may terminate, or bring the deficiency from child to
parent, where it is executed again. Note that it is ok for a root to be
deficient: we don't have to REBALANCE it.

Let DN be the deficient node (originaly, the one from which x was removed).
Choose one of the 3 possibilities below: Note 1 and 2 are symmetric for
right/left siblings (if both are true, choose to do either one)

1) If DN's right sibling has > b/2 (5/2 = 2) values
     (in this case, it won't be deficient after removing one of its keys/value)
     add the parent's separator of these siblings to the DN at the end
      (remove it from the parent; the DN is now not deficient)
     update the parent's separator to be the first element in the right sibling
       (remove it from the right sibling)

2) If DN's left sibling has > b/2 (5/2 = 2) values
     (in this case, it won't be deficient after removing one of its keys/value)
     add the parent's separator of these siblings to the DN at the beginning
      (remove it from the parent; the DN is now not deficient)
     update the parent's separator to be the last element in the left sibling
       (remove it from the left sibling)

3) If DN's left and right siblings are both <= b/2 values (5/2 = 2)
   create a new node with DN's values, the values of one sibling, and the
     separator in the parent of DN and that sibling; the DN is now not deficient
   remove the separator from parent, if the parent is deficient (but not root)
     repeat this rebalancing


Analysis:

Recall that we are choosing a B-tree of order b. Such a tree, in the best case,
will have b-1 keys/values at the root; it will have b(b-1) keys/values at depth
1, ... it will have b^d(b-1) at depth d. In the best case, the height
of an N value tree will be about Log(base b) N (with each node filled with
keys/ values). In the worst case we will have b/2 values at all depths but the
root, so the height will be at worst about Log(base b/2) N.

The idea is to choose b to be as big as possible (the biggest possible base
for the logarithm) so that as many the keys and subtree pointers as possible
fit into one block of memory that can be easily transferred between main and
external memory. Recall that getting/putting information from/to external
memory takes about the same amount of time no matter even if a large amount of
information is transferred, so let's transfer a lot each time. We make b so big
that it stores hundreds or thousands of keys and subtree pointers in each
memory block. Note that for complexity class analysis, all log bases are the
equivalent, but we know that Log(base 2) N is going to be bigger than
Log(base 1,000) N: by a factor of about 10. So it would require doing 1/10th
the number of block transfers.

For all the B-tree operations, we must get the block for the root (we might as
well pre-fetch/cache this permanently in main memory), then get the block for
each subtree node we visit on the path to each key/value we are searching for,
inserting, or deleting.  In the worst case we must search all the way down to
a leaf node, doing one block transfer for each depth in the tree; for insertion
and deletion, in the worst case we must revisit every node back on the path to
the root (and possibly its siblings), and change information in these nodes and 
write them back to external memory. So the total number of block transwers will
typically be bounded by the depth times some small constant.

For example, if we are doing an insert, we must

  1) transfer each block into main memory going down the tree to a leaf
  2) update the "leaf" block with the new value and transfer it back to
       external memory
  3) transfer each "parent" block into main memory when going back up the tree
       (when promoting a value from child to parent)
  4) update each "parent block" and transfer it back to external memory.

Note, we are likely able to cache each block that is transfered on the way down,
so step 3 is not necessary, but if we update each "parent" block, step 4 is
still necessary.

Finally, there are pictures that are available online with this lecture that
illustrates examples that I will do on the board in class, for inserting and
removing nodes from a B-tree of order 5: so every node (but the root) will
store between 2-4 values (and 3-5 pointers to subtrees).
