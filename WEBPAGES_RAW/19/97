<P>ABSTRACT:
</P>
<P>We build several highly-practical and optimized signcryption constructions 
	directly from trapdoor permutations, in the random oracle model.&nbsp; All our 
	constructions share features such as simplicity, efficiency, generality, 
	near-optimal exact security, flexible and ad-hoc key management, key reuse for 
	sending/receiving data, optimally-low message expansion, "backward" use for 
	plain signature/encryption, long message and associated data support, the 
	stronger known qualitative security (so-called IND-CCA and sUF-CMA) and, 
	finally, compatibility with the PKCS#1 infrastructure.&nbsp; While some of 
	these features are present in previous works to various extents, we believe 
	that our schemes improve on earlier proposals in at least several dimensions.</P>
