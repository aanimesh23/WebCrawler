                    <li>System should require nothing more than a web browser to access.
                        Internet Explorer and FireFox have been successfully tested, but
                        others are not guaranteed to work (Safari has known issues).
                    <li>Reagents are generally "1 equivalent" unless otherwise stated.
                    <li>Syntheses are generated randomly by the system,
                        thus the solutions and steps suggested by the system
                        may be non-unique and non-ideal.

                <div class="module-sub-header margin-top">"Real" Examination Caveats</div>
                <ul class="bottom-border">
                    <li>When generating reaction products, the system will often
                        omit "inherent products" in the results for the sake of brevity.
                        For example, bromine radical addition should yield HBr as a by product
                        and condensation reactions should yield H<sub>2</sub>O
                        in the products, but the system does not display these.
                        For "real" examination purposes, you should
                        include all of these to properly balance all reaction equations.
                    <li>While practicing with the system, selecting a reagent from a list
                        is simple enough, don't forget that in "real" exams, you will most likely
                        have to write out the complete reagent specifications from memory.

                        <li>A. Check out the <a href="#walkthroughs">walkthroughs</a> which
                            include step-by-step instructions on how to get started
                            with the most common tasks.
                        <br><br>
                        <li><b>Q. How do I login to the site?</b>
                        <li>A. There is no formal login page for the site.
                                When you generate a synthesis problem from the "Synthesis Explorer"
                                setup box, just make sure you put in your user ID (student ID number)
                                next to the "User Class and ID" label and the system
                                will keep track of your records from there.
                        <br><br>
                        <li><b>Q. How do I submit a completed problem?</b>
                        <li>A. There is no separate answer submission step.  If you "logged in"
                                by putting in your user ID as described above, just work on the
                                synthesis problems and as soon as you enter the right answer,
                                the system will automatically congratulate you on your success
                                and record your progress in the system.  You can verify this as
                                it will state "Your progress was recorded in the system."
                        <br><br>
                        <li><b>Q. How many attempts do I get to complete a problem?  Is there a time limit?</b>
                        <li>A. All problems provide an unlimited number of tries,
                            with no penalty for guessing.  Problems do not have time limits
                            (other than due dates for assignments).  The system does not
                            ever record anything you do "wrong," it only records when you
                            get a problem correct.  So feel free to click around and experiment
                            with different things.  You will never be penalized and this can
                            be a great way to really learn and master the material.
                        <br><br>
                        <li><b>Q. How do I work the synthesis problems?</b>
                        <li>A. Check out the <a href="#walkthroughs">walkthroughs</a> which
                            include step-by-step instructions on how to get started.
                        <br><br>
                        <li><b>Q. How do I check how many problems I've already completed?</b>

                            Most students will just be interested in the "Progress Checklist"
                            to see how to complete their class requirements, but
                            detailed "Problem Records" are also available under the User Records section.
                        <br><br>
                        <li><b>Q. When I work on "random" synthesis problems, what chapter should I work on?</b>
                        <li>A. This is largely up to you.  You have the freedom and flexibility to
                            select any chapters you feel you need to review the most.  Note that you can
                            even select multiple chapters to generate more challenging (and realistic) problems.
                            <br><br>
                            Beware that, depending on your class, you may have
                            additional requirements to complete at least X problems
                            from each relevant chapter.  In that case, you should try
                            to cover the chapters listed on your Progress Checklist page.
                            <br><br>
                            Fulfilling these chapter requirements is easier than you probably think:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Completing assigned (non-random) problems counts towards
                                    completing the chapter requirements.
                                <li>You can select multiple chapters when generating a
                                    random problem (Ctrl+Click to select multiple),
                                    and then completing just one such problem will count towards
                                    all included chapters.
                                <li>Technically you could generate and solve just 2 problems that
                                    include every chapter and that will already fulfill
                                    the chapter requirements.
                            </ul>
                        <br><br>
                        <li><b>Q. I've been working on one of the assigned "non-random" problems forever and still cannot figure it out.  Can I get some help?</b>
                        <li>A. Some notes and tips on non-random problems:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Don't feel bad if you're having trouble with the assigned problems,
                                    they are specifically designed to be challenging.
                                <li>Unlike "random" problems, the assigned "non-random" problems do not allow you
                                    to see the solution until you have solved them, but you do still get
                                    to see the starting material "hint" and have unlimited tries with no penalty for guessing.
                                <li>Check the Reaction Drills for the respective chapters or the Examples links
                                    for the reagents if you need to review the major types of reactions.
                                <li>Go back to doing random problems from the same chapters to get more
                                    practice with the material until you can figure it out.
                                <li>Hint: Note that when you select a non-random problem, it includes a
                                    description like [Smith 11.12...].  This refers to the last chapter section
                                    that you need to know to solve the problem and if you read that particular
                                    section, it's probably a big hint towards how to solve the problem.
                                <li>For most classes, you can still get partial credit for
                                    the work you do even if you're unable to solve every assigned non-random problem.
                                <li>If you are still struggling, try working with your classmates or instructors to
                                    figure out the solutions.  No computer system is ever going to replace having
                                    a good colleague to discuss with.
                            </ul>
                        <br><br>
                        <li><b>Q. One of the synthesis frames (reactant or reagent) will not load, preventing me from working on the problems.  What can I do?</b>
                        <li>A. Several students have reported this issue, however I have been unable to
                            reproduce it to debug it.
                            <br><br>
                            If you can at least get the Product and Pathway frames loaded,
                            there are a couple links at the bottom of the Product frame which allow you
                            to selectively reload the Reactants and Reagents frames.
                            <br><br>
                            Another alternative is to click on the
                            "Select a Reactant" or "Select a Reagent" boxes from the

                        <li><b>Q. My web browser "freezes" when I try to work on a problem.  What can I do?</b>
                        <li>A. I have not been able to consistently reproduce such issues, but here are
                            some possible ideas.
                            <ul>
                                <li>One known cause of "freezing" is some kind of defect in the
                                    Skype instant messenger, Internet Explorer add-in.
                                    Read the following web page for more details on how
                                    to get rid of it:
                                    <a href="http://share.skype.com/sites/devzone/2007/06/the_skype_addin_for_internet_e.html">http://share.skype.com/sites/devzone/2007/06/the_skype_addin_for_internet_e.html</a>
                                <li>Your best bet may be to just try it
                                    from a different computer.  I tried several computers in the
                                    science library and they all work.
                                <li>Make sure all other windows and applications are closed
                                    and not interfering with the site.
                                <li>Maybe avoid the [Mechanism] and "magnify" functions as I noticed
                                    FireFox has trouble loading the Java applet the first time.
                                    Once it successfully loads once (even if it's in Internet Explorer)
                                    it does seem to work thereafter.  You should still be able to complete
                                    all synthesis problems without using any of these pages.
                                <li>Check the FAQ about frames not loading which has some tips
                                    which may be related to what's happening.
                            </ul>
                        <br><br>
                        <li><b>Q. The system shows the reactant, reagent and product for all reactions, so what am I actually supposed to do?</b>
                        <li>A. First, make sure you are not in the "Reaction Drills" section.
                            Those are only for your review and are not graded.
                            If you are in the actual "Synthesis Explorer" interface,
                            the system does predict the products for you, but your job
                            is to come up with the right sequence and combination of reactants
                            and reagents to arrive at the "Target Product" in the top-right frame.
                        <br><br>
                        <li><b>Q. I tried every reactant and reagent combination and none of them produced the target product.  What's wrong?</b>
                        <li>A. These are supposed to be *multi-step* synthesis problems,
                            so it's very likely that the problem cannot be solved by
                            any single reactant-reagent combination.
                            To complete a multi-step synthesis problem,
                            after you complete one reaction, you need to click on
                            the *product* of the reaction to copy it as a *reactant*
                            for a subsequent step.
                            The synthesis problem walkthrough illustrates an example of this.
                        <br><br>
                        <li><b>Q. I am an instructor from another institution and am interested in using the system in my class.  How can I go about this?</b>
                        <li>A. Your students can already freely access the system to work on problems.
                            If they "login" with a unique identifier (e.g., student ID number), the system
                            will also track the problem completion records.  As the instructor, you may then
                            review these records from the <a href="../ProblemRecordWeb.py">Problem Records</a> page
                            which includes additional instructions.
                            <br><br>
                            For more advanced instructor features, such as assigning specific (vs. random) problems
                            with enforced due dates, instructors should <a id="contacts-link" href="#contacts">contact the developers</a>
                            to arrange an appropriate collaboration to configure the system accordingly.

                                reactant side of the next mechanism step to be completed.
                                Refer to the <a href="#mechanismSketching">Mechanism Sketching Tips</a>
                                for more info on how to use the sketcher.  In general, the only functions
                                you should need in this sketcher are the curved arrow buttons on the left (circled).
                                <br>This requires a Java applet, signed by <a href="http://www.chemaxon.com">ChemAxon</a>,
                                so make sure you have Java enabled in your browser and you accept the applet.
                                If you do not wish to use it, you can still view the expected mechanism with
                                the Solution button.
                            <li><b>Mechanism Product</b>:

                                from the mechanism arrow diagram on the left.  If presented as a sketcher,
                                that means you must modify the sketcher contents yourself to represent
                                the expected product structure.  In general, the only functions you should need
                                in this sketcher are the bond drawing tool and the formal charge modifiers (circled).
                            <li><b>Product Generator / Mechanism Calculator</b>:
                                Once you have completed a mechanism step diagram with
                                curved arrows, click here to have the system actually
                                "apply" the arrows to the molecule, changing the
                                configuration of bonds and electrons, to generate
                                the expected product of the diagram.

                                <br><b>Hint</b>:
                                    Click to load the next expected step's structures into the sketcher(s).
                                    From there, just complete the step with curved arrows representing
                                    the electron flows between the reactant and product sides.

                        The mechanism / structure sketcher applet should look similar to the following.
                        This is a fully-featured sketcher with many different
                        functions, including the creation of your own novel molecules.
                        For most cases however, there are only few functions you will ever need.

                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Component Select and Erase</b>:
                                    Use the select tool to click-and-drag pieces of the diagram around.
                                    This can help arrange the diagram pieces to facilitate arrow drawing.
                                    The eraser can be used to remove unnecessary pieces.
                                <li><b>Electron Flow Arrows</b>:
                                    Two different types of curved arrows can be used to sketch electron flows.
                                    The first is a typical arrow for moving 2 electrons at a time, while the second
                                    is a "fishhook" arrow for moving 1 electron at a time (i.e., radical reactions).
                                    Alternatively, you may access the arrow functions from the
                                    Insert &gt; Electron Flow command menu.
                                <li><b>Bond and Charge Modifiers</b>:
                                    The product structure sketcher will generally be pre-loaded with the reactant
                                    structure for the next mechanism step.  To convert it into the expected product
                                    structure, you will generally only need to use the bond tool to
                                    create new bonds or modify bond orders, as well as the formal charge modifiers.

                                    <br><b>Arrow Drawing Tips</b>:
                                    Once you select an arrow type, just click on the source
                                    of an arrow such as a bond or atom (i.e., lone pair or free radical),
                                    and then on the target / sink for the arrow, usually
                                    an atom or the space between two atoms where a new bond <i>will</i> form.
                                    In the last case, a dashed line should
                                    appear in the place where this incipient bond would form
                                    to help you precisely specify your diagram target.
                
                                    <br><b>Bonds as Electron Sources</b>:
                                    When the source of an electron flow is a bond, special care must
                                    be taken when selecting the target / sink for the flow.
                                    Information on the "polarity" of the bond, in particular, which
                                    atom of the source bond the electrons will remain attached to,
                                    must be specified.  This is specified by having the target of
                                    the electron flow be slightly <i>between</i> a target atom
                                    and at least one of the source atoms.  See the first two examples
                                    below for what may appear to be the same mechanism step, but
                                    which differs in the result based on how the polarity of
                                    the source bond is specified, as indicated by the blue half-circles
                                    around the target atoms, and the dashed line representing an
                                    incipient "forming" bond.
                
                                    <br><b>Free Radical Mechanisms</b>:
                                    The last example below illustrates a free radical mechanism step.
                                    These commonly involve 3 "fishhook" arrows and often involve
                                    2 such arrows meeting halfway <i>between</i> two atoms,
                                    again indicated by the dashed line for a forming bond.
