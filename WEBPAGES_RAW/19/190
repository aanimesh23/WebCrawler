once took, so it may have been the first place I saw a proof of Euler's
formula.  Now I'm not so sure about it.  It gives some history of the
Euler formula, which follows common folklore (erroneously, according to
<a href="#Mal">Malkevitch</a>) in attributing the formula to Descartes,
and muffs the proof -- Henle gives the <a href="triangle.html">triangle

This article provides some speculation on how Euler might have found
his formula, relating it to P&oacute;lya's theories of mathematical discovery.
It also gives a proof of equivalence of the Euler characteristic
and total angular defect closely related to the
<a href="angle.html">sum of angles</a> proof presented here.

the Euler characteristic can be viewed (along with e.g. volume and surface area) as one of the fundamental translation-invariant functions on unions of convex sets.
The
<a href="val.html">valuation-based proof</a> is from section 5.2;
the other key sections related to the Euler characteristic are 3.2 (showing that the characteristic is well defined for simplicial complexes) and 7.3 (generalizing Euler's formula to other intrinsic volumes).

In addition, the following look very interesting,
but I haven't found time to read them yet:

<LI><a name="Chen">Chen</a>,
"On the Euler characteristic of finite unions of convex sets",
Disc. Comput. Geom. 10, 1993, 79-93.
<P>
Abstract: The Euler characteristic plays an important role in many
subjects of discrete and continuous mathematics. For noncompact spaces,
its homological definition, being a homotopy invariant, seems not as
important as its role for compact spaces. However, its combinatorial
definition, as a finitely additive measure, proves to be more applicable
in the study of singular spaces such as semialgebraic sets finitely
subanalytic sets, etc.  The author introduces an interesting integral by
means of which the combinatorial Euler characteristic can be defined
without the necessity of decomposition and extension as in the
traditional treatment for polyhedra and finite unions of compact convex
sets. Since finite unions of closed convex sets cannot be obtained by
cutting convex sets as in the polyhedral case, a separate treatment of
the Euler characteristic for functions generated by indicator functions
of closed convex sets and relatively open convex sets is necessary, and
this forms the content of this paper.

"The Euler characteristic is the unique locally determined numerical
homotopy invariant of finite complexes",
Disc. Comput. Geom. 7, 1992, 59-67.
<P>
Abstract: The author shows that if a numerical homotopy invariant of finite
simplicial complexes has a local formula, then, up to multiplication by an
obvious constant, the invariant is the Euler characteristic. Moreover, the
Euler characteristic itself has a unique local formula.

<LI><a name="RW">Rocek and Williams</a>,
"On the Euler characteristic of piecewise linear manifolds",
Phys. Lett. B, 273, 1991, 95-99.
<P>
Abstract: The Dehn-Sommerville relations and the corresponding equations for
the angle sums are used to derive two expressions for the Euler
characteristic of a simplicial manifold, firstly in terms of the numbers
of even dimensional subsimplices, and secondly in terms of
even-dimensional deficit angles. In each case the coefficients involved
are related to the Bernoulli numbers.
