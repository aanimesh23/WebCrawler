The Maximized Average Tree Pruning Problem
<br>
Presented by Josiah Carlson
</h2>
<p>
Abstract: In this talk we will define the maximized average tree
pruning problem, we will describe the pitfalls in solving the problem,
and we will finally describe our algorithm which has worst-case
O(n&nbsp;log<sup>2n</sup>) running time.
<p>
This is a joint work of Josiah Carlson and David Eppstein.
