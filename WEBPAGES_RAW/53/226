<h2>About</h2>
My work is in the area of statistical machine learning.
I graduated from <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/">Padhraic Smyth</a>'s <a href="http://www.datalab.uci.edu/">DataLab</a> group at <a href="http://www.uci.edu">UCI</a>.
I was a postdoctoral scholar in <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~getoor/index.shtml">Lise Getoor</a>'s <a href="http://linqs.cs.umd.edu/projects/">LINQS</a> research group at the <a href = "http://www.ucsc.edu/">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>. Now I am a postdoctoral scholar at the <a href = "http://www.ucsd.edu/">University of California, San Diego</a>.

<LI>My <B><font size = "5"><a href="JFouldsPhDThesis.pdf">PhD thesis</a></font></B> has a lot of tutorial-style introductory material on probabilistic latent variable modeling, which you may find useful.</LI>
<BR>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
I develop <B>probabilistic models</B> and associated <B>inference algorithms</B> for finding <B>interpretable latent structure</B> in social network and text data. I accomplish this by using <B>latent variable modeling</B> techniques, leveraging topic models, probabilistic matrix factorization, Bayesian nonparametrics, and related methods.

<P>Previously, I have worked on supervised machine learning/data mining, multi-instance learning, cognitive robot mapping, operations research, and artificial intelligence for the game of Go.</P>

<h2>Software</h2>
<li> At the behest of the University of Waikato Department of Mathematics, I created <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tuataratmsim/">Tuatara Turing Machine Simulator </A>, a graphical Turing machine simulator and construction tool for teaching purposes.</li>
<li> I also worked on the GUI for the Boundary Visualizer, a classification visualization tool in <A HREF="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/"> WEKA </A>, a popular java open source data mining toolkit developed at the University of Waikato.</li>
<BR>


<h2>Other Interests</h2>
<li> I am a member of the Korean drumming group Hansori. </li> 
<li> I was a performing member of the Japanese taiko drumming group <A HREF="http://www.waitaiko.com"> Waitaiko </A>. </li>
<li> I played guitar in the (now disbanded) rock group <A HREF = "http://profile.myspace.com/4secondfuse"> 4 Second Fuse</A>.</li>
<li> In 2007-2008, I was part of the problem reviewing/writing team for the ACM South Pacific Programming Contest. </li>
<li> For a number of years, I was involved with the executive committee of the <A HREF="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/studentacm/"> Waikato ACM Student Chapter </A>. </li>
