Data Compression Techniques for Stock Market Prediction<br>
Dan Halem, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

(Based on a paper by S. Azhar, G. Badros, A. Glodjo, M. Kao and J.
Reif from <a href= 
"http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~dcc/Programs/Program94.html">DCC
'94</a>.) 

<p>This paper presents advanced data compression techniques for
predicting stock markets behavior under widely accepted market
models in finance. Our techniques are applicable to technical
analysis, portfolio theory, and nonlinear market models. We find
that lossy and lossless compression techniques are well suited for
predicting stock prices as well as market modes such as strong
trends and major adjustments. We also present novel applications of
multispectral compression techniques to portfolio theory,
correlation of similar stocks, effects of interest rates,
transaction costs and taxes.</p>
