<P>
As sometimes happens, aggressive schedules slip.  In the case
of this meeting, Dave Long and Andy Schulert actually gave their
presentations after lunch.  This resulted in a more compressed
time for discussion.  The topic of the working group's purpose
and sponsorship was revisited in the afternoon session, immediately
after the talks.
