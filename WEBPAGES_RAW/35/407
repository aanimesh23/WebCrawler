<P>
The CMM approach to guiding software process improvement and to 
evaluating software development capability has spread widely into the 
commercial software sector over the last ten years. This presentation 
will map the current FDA regulations for medical device software to the
CMM. Three questions will be addressed: (1) Would a Level 3 company be 
compliant with the FDA regulations? (2) At what CMM level(s) would an 
organization be rated if its products were compliant with the FDA 
regulations? (3) What might the CMM community leverage from the FDA 
approach?

<p>
Developing high quality software for use in medical devices is critical
to ensuring patient and operator safety. Firms developing medical
devices 
that contain software are working more closely with the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in order to understand and satisfy established 
regulations that apply to their products. This presentation will 
(1) provide a summary of the cooperative efforts that are taking place 
between industry and FDA to further the understanding of FDA
expectations      
related to software development. It will (2) provide an overview of the
regulations, guidance documents, an on-site FDA inspection strategies 
that apply to medical device software development and address the 
question of "What is the FDA really looking for?"
