Adaptive Inference in Graphical Models</font><br><br>
<h1>About Adaptive Inference</h1>
<p>Adaptive inference refers to the task of <i>recomputing</i> the results
of an inference problem which is only slightly different from one which has
already been solved.  It uses concepts from incremental computing, in which
the amount of work we expect to do to solve a problem is (hopefully)
proportional to the amount of <i>change</i> in the problem from our
already-solved version.  In particular, we use rake and compress trees
(RC-Trees) to cache sufficient statistics of the inference process
in such a way that a large fraction of them are guaranteed to be reusable
no matter what (small) changes are made to the original graphical model,
including changing factors or potential functions, adding or removing variables,
or modifying the graph connectivity.

For a system of <i>N</i> variables, the sum-product version of the code can update 
the marginal distribution of
<i>K</i> specified variables in <i>O(K log N/K)</i> time.  
The max-product version of the code keeps track of an optimal configuration of variables
(the MPE or MAP configuration), and after any change which induces <i>K</i> changes
in the optimal configuration, finds all those changes in <i>O(K log N/K)</i> time,
without the locations needing to be specified.

short usage and disclaimer statements that follow, however.

<h1>Using the Code</h1>
<p>This code is mainly intended for educational purposes, to provide a working implementation
for anyone wishing to make use of the algorithms in their own work.  It is not optimized,
nor does it have the greatest of user interfaces.

<p>The Matlab functions given here were used in the NIPS 2007 publication, and assume that the
underlying graph is tree-structured.  The SSP 2009 paper also used mainly tree-structured
graphs, including HMMs, and the code should work for these problems as well, but I haven't tried it.

<p>The code includes versions for sum-product (computing marginal distributions) and dynamic
programming for optimization (max-product to compute sufficient statistics, then selecting
a configuration of the variables in the downward pass).  The functions corresponding to each
are designated "SP" and "MP", respectively.

<h1>Using the MEX Functions</h1>
<p>The algorithms involved in this work rely heavily on pointers and memory re-allocation, 
neither of which is a strong point of the Matlab programming environment.  To make the
algorithms scale in the proper way, certain aspects of Matlab's memory management system
were bypassed; this is done using MEX files to directly access and change the array and
cell array contents.  However, these functions are undocumented and are not guaranteed;
they worked for me but may not work for you.  Here is the disclaimer in the C files:

<p>WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!  This MEX file is not for the faint of heart.
It attempts to circumvent Matlab's memory-handling functions in order
to give more efficient code, and uses undocumented functions to do so.
It comes with no guarantees whatsoever.  It may not work on other
versions of Matlab, or other platforms, or even at all.  It may result
in memory leaks, segmentation faults, destroy data, set your computer on 
fire, or suck it into a black hole, for all I know.  If you do not accept 
these possible risks, do not use this MEX file.

<p>If that doesn't deter you, assuming you have MEX properly set up (see my KDE toolbox
page for some pointers on that subject) you should be able to compile the functions
using the "buildmex" script.
