Non-Isomorphic Graph Generation<br>
Brad Hutchings, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

Time and space efficient non-isomorphic graph generation may have
applications in graph compression, generating graph catalogs, and
computationally looking at properties of sets of graphs. <a href= 
"http://cs.anu.edu.au/people/bdm/">Brendan McKay</a>'s paper <a
href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/people/bdm/papers/orderly.ps.gz"><i>
Isomorph-Free Exhaustive Generation</i></a> presents an abstract
framework that can be applied to many interesting graph and
non-graph generation problems. I will discuss two graph generation
problems, Maximal Planar Graphs and Triangle Free Graphs. I will
then explain how McKay's general method applies to graph problems
and compare with selected graph generation schemes.
