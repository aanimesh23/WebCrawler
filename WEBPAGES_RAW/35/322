The Parity of the Number of Spanning Trees in a Graph<br>
<a href="/~eppstein/">David Eppstein</a>, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

Every bipartite Eulerian graph has an even number of spanning
trees. More generally, a graph has evenly many spanning trees if
and only if it has an Eulerian edge cut, and if B is any edge cut
in a graph G, the gcd of vertex degrees in B divides the number of
spanning trees of G. The proofs of these facts are based on a new
algebraic characterization of the number of spanning trees of G,
