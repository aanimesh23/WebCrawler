<h3>Checkin Link (see Recording Attendance below)</h3>
Click the 
<a href="https://checkin.ics.uci.edu" target="_new">Checkin<a>
link when you are told the appropriate word in class.<br>
If you cannot check in, see Rich, right after class, othewise you will be<br>
marked absent.
<p>


<h3>Instructors</h3>

<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/">David G. Kay<a>
  (<a href="mailto:kay@uci.edu">kay@uci.edu</a>)<br>
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/">Rich Pattis<a>
  (<a href="mailto:pattis@ics.uci.edu">pattis@ics.uci.edu</a>)
<p>

<p>
<h3>Course Goals and Plans</h3>
The three main goals of ICS 90 are to help new students make a successful<br>
transition to UCI, to build a sense of community in ICS, and to introduce <br>
new undergrads to the school, some of the faculty, the majors we offer,<br>
and the work we do.
<p>
In a typical class session, two faculty members will speak for half an hour<br>
each, about their work and background; David and Rich will then also spend<br>
a half hour addressing more general issues about college life, the field of<br>
computing, and strategies for success in ICS.


<p>
<h3>Student Expectations</h3>

ICS 90 is a one-unit course graded Pass/Not Pass. We have designed it <br>
not to require work outside of the class meetings, but we do expect every<br>
student to attend every class. If you cannot attend a class for any reason,<br>
send an email explanation to
<a href="mailto:pattis@ics.uci.edu">Rich Pattis</a>
as soon as possible. 
<p> It's in class where the learning happens, so you should be present. Before<br>
the first class we will send an email to all our students describing how we<br>
will record attendance electronically.
<p>
For issues that come up between class meetings, we have set up a forum at<br>
piazza.com.
<a href="https://piazza.com/uci/fall2016/ics90">Sign yourself up</a> and then
<a href="https://piazza.com/uci/fall2016/ics90/home">participate</a> by posting
questions or<br>
supplying answers. We may also have opportunities to use Piazza in class<br>
for polls and surveys.
<p>You may bring your phone, tablet, or laptop for attendance-taking and for<br>
using Piazza, but do not use it for other purposes, unless asked by the speaker.<br>
After you check in, please turn off your devices and put them away.
<p>

<h3>Seating: Two Classrooms
</h3>
ICS 90 meets in two rooms at the same time:  BS3 1200 and HSLH 100A.<br>
You are officially enrolled in one section or the other, but <b>ignore which<br>
room you're enrolled in</b> and instead attend in the following room:
<p>
* If your class level is <b>FR</b> or <b>SO</b>, come to BS3 1200.<br>
* If your class level is <b>JR</b> or <b>SR</b>, come to HSLH 100A.
<p>
This is your official "class level" as shown on WebReg at UCI.
<p>
Most weeks, one faculty member will speak starting at 5:00pm and another<br>
will speak starting at 5:30pm. All students are required to be present for<br>
these talks. The third half-hour of each week's class will be devoted to<br>
broader information about college-level work and ICS. This material<br>
is aimed primarily at new students and is required for those whose class<br>
level is <b>FR</b> or <b>SO</b>. We will have these discussions in BS3 1200 only.<br>
Upper division students (from HSLH 100A) are welcome to attend this<br>
third half-hour (the room is just three minutes away), but they may also<br>
choose to skip it.
<p>

<h3>Recording Attendance
</h3>
Bring a phone, tablet, laptop, smart device to class that allows web browsing.
<p>
During the lecture we will ask you to navigate to the ICS-90 Checkin page<br>
and record that you are attending class by following the Checkin link at the<br>
top of this web page. There you will see a message with instructions about<br>
how to continue. There, You will enter a special word that we will announce<br>
in class. On some days there might be multiple checking words.
<p>
It is an Academic Integrity violation to run this App and then leave<br>
class early, unless you have an emergency or have arranged permission<br>
beforehand with Rich Pattis. Likewise, you cannot check in for other<br>
students, but you may allow present students to use your device to run<br>
the App.
