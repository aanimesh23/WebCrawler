What is life?<br />
It is the flash of a firefly in the night.<br />
It is the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime.<br />
It is the little shadow which runs across the grass<br />
and loses itself in the sunset.<br />
<i>-- Crowfoot's last words (1890), Blackfoot warrior and orator.</i>

<blockquote>
Almost everybody feels at peace with nature: listening to the ocean waves against the shore, by a still lake, in a field of grass, on a windblown heath. One day, when we have learned the timeless way again, we shall feel the same about our towns, and we shall feel as much at peace in them, as we do today walking by the ocean, or stretched out in the long grass of a meadow.<br />
<i>-- Christopher Alexander, The Timeless Way of Building (1979)</i>
