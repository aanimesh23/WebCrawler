				<h2><i><span style="COLOR: purple">Introduction</span></i></h2>
				<p>For this project, you will write a program that handles some relatively simple 
					payroll-processing tasks for a small business. While working on this project, 
					you will gain experience with inheritance and polymorphism, the use of the 
					generic
					<span class="SpellE">ArrayList</span>
					class in the Java library, enumerations, and using the console as well as files 
					to read input and write formatted output. These skills will be relied upon 
					throughout the quarter in future projects, so it is very important to start 
					early and leave yourself plenty of time to get your questions answered and 
					finish the project.</p>
				<P>For this lab, you'll need to read the section 2.5.2 of chapter 2 which deals 
					with generics.</P>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">
					<hr align="center" size="2" width="100%">

				<h2><i><span style="COLOR: purple">The program</span></i></h2>
				<p>You should write a program which allows the user to manage payroll for a small 
					company. In the <STRONG>first part</STRONG> of the assignment (which, however, 
					we will not test), your program&nbsp;will presents a console-mode user 
					interface that will allow the user to enter and remove individual employees, 
					list them, and do a weekly payroll.&nbsp; In the <STRONG>second part</STRONG> of 
					the assignment (the only one we will test), your program will take the user's 
					input from a file instead of the console.</p>
				<P>
					The payroll data consists of a list of employees. There are three kinds of 
					employees: <i>hourly employees</i>, <i>salaried employees</i>, and <i>contract 
						employees</i>. Each kind of employee has different characteristics, as 
					described a bit later in the write-up. At the end of each week, the program 
					will be used to generate and display nicely-formatted paychecks for all of the 
					employees of the company.</P>
				<P><STRONG>First version of your program (not graded):</STRONG></P>
				<p>The first version of your program should provide a console interface that 
					handles the following commands from the user:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
					<li class="MsoNormal">
						<b>Add Employee</b>. Asks the user to specify the type of employee (hourly, 
					salaried, or contract) and all of the information that describes the employee. 
					(Note that different kinds of employees are described by different information, 
					see below.)&nbsp; If the employee of that name already exists on the list, warn 
					the user and do not add the new employee (they better ask for the new person's 
					middle name).&nbsp; If no employee with the matching name exists,&nbsp;the 
					newly-described employee is added to end of the employee list.
					<li class="MsoNormal">
						<b>Remove Employee</b>
					. Asks the user to specify the name of the employee to remove. Goes through the 
					list of employees and removes an employee with a matching name.&nbsp; If no 
					such employee exists, the user should be warned but the list of the employees 
					stays unchanged.
					<li class="MsoNormal">
						<b>Show Employees</b>. Prints the entire list of employees to the console, 
					one employee per line. All relevant information about each employee is shown 
					(i.e. name, type of employee, wage or salary).
					<li class="MsoNormal">
						<b>Do Weekly Payroll</b>. For each employee in the list of employees, including 
						those who are not paid by the hour, the program asks the user to specify the 
						number of hours worked this week. (It is necessary to include, on each 
						paycheck, an indication of the number of hours worked for all employees, 
						regardless of whether their pay is determined by the number of hours they 
						worked.) <i>After asking about all the employees,</i>
					the program prints paychecks for each employee to the console, one after 
					another. Finally, the program prints the total gross pay and total tax for all 
					of the employees.
					<li class="MsoNormal">
						<b>Quit</b>. Exits the program.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A message should be printed on the console regarding whether or not the command 
					is executed successfully if necessary to make a friendly user interface. Such 
					message could be "The employee is successfully added!" or "file successfully 
					read".&nbsp; We provide a lot of code that helps you process this console input 
					(see the link to the Zip file below), so almost all the code that you really 
					need to write to get this initial version of your program to run will be 
					reusable in the second version described&nbsp;below.
				</p>
				<P><STRONG>Second version of your program (this will be&nbsp;graded):</STRONG></P>
				<P>The second version of your program will not handle any user's commands from the 
					console.&nbsp; Instead, one will call your program with a command like this:</P>
				<P><FONT face="Courier New"><FONT size="2"><SPAN class="GramE">java</SPAN>&nbsp;Company 
							inputfile.txt</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P><FONT face="Courier New" size="2">Y</FONT>our program should take all the input 
					from the inputfile.txt file and process it from top to bottom as follows:&nbsp; 
					The file can specify exactly the same instructions (except of <STRONG>Quit</STRONG>) 
					which the user can specify above.&nbsp; In each case, the first line of the 
					input file specifies the command name, and the few subsequent lines specify all 
					the data that the user would input for such command.&nbsp; (The number of these 
					lines differs for different commands.)&nbsp; For example, the inputfile.txt can 
					include a block of lines as follows:</P>
				<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">AddEmployee</SPAN></P>
				<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&lt;Employee_Name (string, 
which can include spaces)&gt;</SPAN></P>
				<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&lt;Employee_Type 
(string)&gt;</SPAN></P>
				<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&lt;Employee_<SPAN class="GramE">HourlyPayment (</SPAN>if is hourly employee or Contract <SPAN class="SpellE">emplyee</SPAN>) or <SPAN class="SpellE">AnnualPayment</SPAN>(if is 
salaried employee)(in dollars)&gt;</SPAN></P>
				<P>Your program, seeing such line in the inputfile.txt file, should trigger the 
					same procedure as the <STRONG>Add Employee</STRONG> command does above, and it 
					treats the data on the next three lines in the same way as this command 
					does.&nbsp;
				</P>
				<P>The file can also specify that some employee should be removed from the list if 
					it includes the following block of two lines:</P>
				<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">RemoveEmployee</SPAN></P>
				<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&lt;Name_of_Employee_To_Be_Removed&gt;</SPAN></P>
				<P>Your program, on encountering such group of lines in the inputfile.txt should 
					process it the same way as it processed the <B>Remove Employee</B> command 
					above.</P>
				<P>Also, the program can have a group of lines as follows:</P>
				<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">WeeklyPayroll</SPAN></P>
				<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&lt;Name_of_1st_Employee&gt;</SPAN></P>
				<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&lt;Hour_worked_for_1st_Employee&gt;</SPAN></P>
				<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">...</SPAN></P>
				<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">
					<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&lt;Name_of_<EM>n</EM>th_Employee&gt;</SPAN></P>
					<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&lt;Hour_worked_for_<EM><U>n</U></EM>th_Employee&gt;</SPAN></P>
				</SPAN>
				<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
				<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Your program should handle it the way the first 
					version handled the <STRONG>Do Weekly Payroll </STRONG>command above.&nbsp; The

				<h2><i><span style="COLOR: purple">Kinds of employees</span></i></h2>
				<p>There are three kinds of employees that your program will be required to 
					process: <i>hourly employees</i>, <i>salaried employees</i>, and <i>contract 
						employees</i>. For our purposes, they differ in the following ways:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
					<li class="MsoNormal">
					Hourly employees are paid an hourly wage (e.g. $9.50 per hour). They are paid 
					this wage for each of their first 40 hours worked in a week. If an hourly 
					employee works more than 40 hours per week, the hours above 40 are paid at 
					"time and a half" (i.e. 1.5 times their hourly wage). So, for example, at 
					$10.00 per hour, if an hourly employee works 60 hours in a week, they are paid 
					$10.00 per hour for each of the first 40 hours, plus $15.00 per hour for the 20 
					additional hours, for a total of $700.00.
					<li class="MsoNormal">
						Salaried employees are paid a fixed yearly salary (e.g. $75,000 per year)<span class="GramE">,</span>
					regardless of the number of hours they work. Each week, they are paid 1/52 of 
					their yearly salary. As an example, a salaried employee with an annual salary 
					of $52,000 will be paid $1,000 per week.
					<li class="MsoNormal">
						Contract employees are paid an hourly rate (e.g. $30.00 per hour), but differ 
						from hourly employees in that they are ineligible for overtime pay; all of 
						their hours are paid at the same rate, regardless of how many hours they work 
						in a week.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>One other way that the employees differ is how they are taxed: hourly and 
					salaried employees are assessed a 20% income tax, while contract employees are 
					not assessed any tax at all. The assumption here is somewhat like in the real 
					world: contract employees are not full-fledged employees of the company, so 
					they are required to handle their own taxes.</p>

				<h2><i><span style="COLOR: purple">Starting point</span></i></h2>
				<p>I have provided quite a bit of code to get you started with this program, 
					including some parts that I've provided in their entirety. The code is 
					available in a<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~stasio/winter06/lab3/Code.zip"> Zip 
						archive</a>. Be sure you look through all of the code - and read all of the 
					comments! -
					<span class="GramE">before</span>
					you get started, so that you don't wind up having to duplicate work that I've 
					already done for you.</p>
				<p>In general, you are required to build from what's been provided, rather than 
					starting from scratch. This gives you the advantage of having some of the more 
					tedious portions done for you, so that you can focus your energies on the 
					portions you'll learn the most from, while giving us the advantage of assuming 
					that all of the programs are built from a common base.</p>

				<h2><i><span style="COLOR: purple">Using inheritance and polymorphism in your program</span></i></h2>
				<p>One of the most important programming habits you can adopt, if you haven't 
					already, is the avoidance of duplicate code. By "duplicate code," I mean having 
					the same code that does the same job for the same reason in more than one place 
					in your program. Duplicate code is not only wasteful; it's also a recipe for 
					disaster. Suppose that, as you're developing a program, you copy and paste the 
					same code into ten different methods scattered throughout the program. Now 
					suppose that you find a bug in one of those ten methods, and that the bug 
					happens to be in the part of the code that you copied. If you're fortunate, 
					you'll remember that you copied the code elsewhere. However, it's doubtful that 
					you'll remember not only that you copied the code, but also precisely how many 
					times and where! If you're lucky, you'll find and fix the code in nine of the 
					ten places, but it's very likely that you'll miss at least one of them. It 
					could be months before you find out about the bug in the tenth place. By the 
					time you do, your understanding of the bug and how to fix it will be long since 
					forgotten. Now imagine that this same scenario has played out over and over 
					again in the development of a very large program. Not surprisingly, one can 
					reasonably expect that the program will <i>never</i> be free from bugs.</p>
				<p>The moral of this story is that whenever you feel the urge to copy and paste a 
					chunk of code, you should stop and think of a better way to solve the problem. 
					If you want to copy the same chunk of code into two methods within the same 
					class, put the code into a third method instead, then call that third method 
					from the other two. If you want to copy the same chunk of code into more than 
					one class, think about creating a third class to house the duplicate code. If 
					substantial portions of two classes are similar, it might be time to think 
					about inheritance, with the third class being the
					<span class="SpellE">superclass</span>
					of the other two.</p>
				<p>You will face this problem more than once while working on this program, as you 
					would face it in virtually all programs of more than a few lines. One time you 
					will face this problem is in your development of classes to represent each kind 
					of employee. There are three kinds of employees in the program - hourly, 
					salaried, and contract - with some similarities and differences between them. 
					The similarities are:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
					<li class="MsoNormal">
					Each employee has a name.
					<li class="MsoNormal">
					A paycheck can be calculated for each employee (though it will be calculated 
					differently for each kind of employee).
					<li class="MsoNormal">
						Each employee can be turned into a String, for the purposes of printing the 
						employee's information to the console. Again, how an employee will be turned 
						into a String will depend on the kind of employee.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The presence of these similarities argues very strongly for a
					<span class="SpellE">superclass</span>
					called Employee, with subclasses for each specific kind of employee (hourly, 
					salaried, and contract). I've provided the Employee class for you (<i>which you are 
						not permitted to modify</i>), but you'll need to write the three 
					subclasses. The good news is that, in each subclass, you'll only need to write 
					the code that distinguishes a particular kind of employee from the others; the 
					code that describes the similarities between all employees will appear only 
					once, in the Employee class.</p>
				<p>There is much to be gained by using this approach other than just the obvious 
					benefit of code reuse. Additionally, it will simplify portions of the user 
					interface. Rather than maintaining a separate data structure for each kind of 
					employee - one for all the hourly employees, one for all the salaried 
					employees, and one for all the contract employees - we can have just one 
					instead, which stores all of the employees, regardless of their type. Then, 
					thanks to polymorphism, when we print an employee's information or ask for a 
					paycheck to be calculated for an employee, the "right thing" will automatically 
					happen, depending on what kind of employee it is.</p>
				<p>Inheritance and polymorphism are important techniques to use in a situation like 
					this one. You are required to define a separate class for each kind of 
					employee, relate them together by extending them all from the provided Employee 
					class, and make use of polymorphism whenever it makes sense.</p>

				<h2><i><span style="COLOR: purple">Using the generic <span class="SpellE">ArrayList</span>
class</span></i></h2>
				<p>One of the key improvements in the latest version of Java is the inclusion of <i>generic 
						classes</i>. What makes a class "generic" is its ability to deal with 
					different kinds of objects in different parts of a program, but in each case to 
					deal with one kind of object specifically. For example, the
					<span class="SpellE">ArrayList</span>
					class is generic. When using the generic version of
					<span class="SpellE">ArrayList</span>, you can specify the type of objects that 
					each of your
					<span class="SpellE">ArrayLists</span>
					will be allowed to hold. For example, if you want to create an
					<span class="SpellE">ArrayList</span>
					of Strings, you would write the following code:</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">ArrayList</span>&lt;String&gt; a = new <span class="SpellE">ArrayList</span>&lt;String<span class="GramE">&gt;(</span>);</pre>
				<p>Two important benefits arise when you can specifically tell Java that you want 
					an
					<span class="SpellE">ArrayList</span>&lt;String&gt;. First, whenever you 
					attempt to add an object into an
					<span class="SpellE">ArrayList</span>&lt;String&gt;, the compiler will give an 
					error message if you try to add one that isn't a String. In other words, an
					<span class="SpellE">ArrayList</span>&lt;String&gt; is guaranteed to have only 
					Strings in it. Second, since an
					<span class="SpellE">ArrayList</span>&lt;String&gt; will only ever have Strings 
					in it, Java will happily assume that any object you pull back out of the
					<span class="SpellE">ArrayList</span>
					is a String. (If you've used
					<span class="SpellE">ArrayList</span>
					before in a previous version of Java, you might remember needing to use casting 
					whenever you accessed individual objects in the list. This is no longer 
					necessary and is, in fact, frowned upon in most situations.)</p>
				<p>Here's a quick example, following on from the one above:</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// each call to <span class="GramE">add(</span>) will add a String to the end of the list a</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">a.add</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>"Mary");</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">a.add</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>"is");</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">a.add</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>"happy");</pre>
				<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>String s = "";</pre>
				<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">for</span> (<span class="SpellE">int</span> <span class="SpellE">i</span> = 0; <span class="SpellE">i</span> &lt; <span class="SpellE">a.size</span>(); <span class="SpellE">i</span>++)</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>{</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// retrieve the <span class="SpellE">i-th</span> element from the list and append it to s</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>s += <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">a.get</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span><span class="SpellE">i</span>);</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}</pre>
				<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// this will print "<span class="SpellE">Maryishappy</span>" to the console</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">System.out.println</span>(s);</pre>
				<p>The only
					<span class="SpellE">ArrayList</span>
					methods I used in my solution to this project were:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
					<li class="MsoNormal">
						<b>add(x)</b>: adds the object <i>x</i>
					to the end of the list
					<li class="MsoNormal">
						<b>get(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)</b>: returns the object in the list with 
						index
						<span class="SpellE">
							<i>i</i></span>; indices are consecutive, with the first object having 
					the index 0, just like in an array
					<li class="MsoNormal">
						<b>remove(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)</b>: removes the object from the list 
						with index
						<span class="SpellE">
							<i>i</i></span>; subsequent objects are "slid back" one cell to fill 
					the empty space
					<li class="MsoNormal">
						<b>size( )</b>: returns the number of objects in the list
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You may wish to use others, though. If so, I recommend looking at the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/5.0/docs/api/index.html">
						Java library documentation</a> for more information. (It's best for you to 
					become acquainted with the library documentation as soon as you can; you'll 
					need it more often as we move forward in this course, and especially after you 
					move on to later courses.)</p>

				<h2><i><span style="COLOR: purple">Console/file input using the Scanner class</span></i></h2>
				<p>The Java library includes a class called Scanner that makes reading input from 
					the console (or other sources) a snap. A Scanner "wraps around" an input 
					source, such as the console or an input file. It can then read either one line 
					or one value at a time from that input source.</p>
				<p>In this program, you'll want to read your input from the console. So, to set up 
					your Scanner, you'd write a line of code like this one:</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// <span class="GramE">Creates</span> a new Scanner wrapped around the console (<span class="SpellE">System.in</span>).</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Scanner s = new <span class="GramE">Scanner(</span><span class="SpellE">System.in</span>);</pre>
				<p>(It should be noted that I've already provided this line of code in the Payroll 
					class.) Once you've created your Scanner, there are many methods you can call 
					on it, to read input of different types. I used these two in my solution:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
					<li class="MsoNormal">
						<span class="SpellE">
							<b>nextLine</b></span><b>( )</b>: reads the next line of input and 
					returns it as a String
					<li class="MsoNormal">
						<span class="SpellE">
							<b>nextInt</b></span><b>( )</b>: reads the next word of input (up to the 
						next space) and returns it as an
						<span class="SpellE">int</span>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As an example, here's a fragment of Java code (following on from the one above) 
					that reads two integers (one per line) from the console, then prints their sum.</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">System.out.print</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>"Enter first integer: ");</pre>
				<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// Read the next integer from the console.</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">int</span></span> i1 = <span class="SpellE">s.nextInt</span>();</pre>
				<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b>// Since <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">nextInt</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>) reads only up to the next space, not to the end of<o:p></o:p></b></pre>
				<pre><b><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// the line, adding a call to <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">nextLine</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>) after each call to <span class="SpellE">nextInt</span>()<o:p></o:p></b></pre>
				<pre><b><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// is a good idea, to consume any leftover input on the line.</b></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">s.nextLine</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>);</pre>
				<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">System.out.print</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>"Enter second integer: ");</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">int</span></span> i2 = <span class="SpellE">s.nextInt</span>();</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">s.nextLine</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>);</pre>
				<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">int</span></span> sum = i1 + i2;</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">System.out.println</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>"The sum is " + sum);</pre>
				<p>As I did in the example, it's always a good idea to prompt the user and explain 
					what kind of input you're interested in. For this project, you will have to 
					deal with exceptions here.
					<span class="SpellE">
						<span class="GramE">nextInt</span>
					</span>
					() throws an Input
					<span class="SpellE">MismatchException</span>
					when it tries to consume input that is not a number. If the exception is not 
					caught in the code, the compiler won't give
					<span class="GramE">a</span>
					error saying there is an exception that should be caught. However, when you run 
					the program, and when the user types a string instead, the program will end 
					unexpectedly. We <em>require</em> you to avoid this unexpectedness and handle 
					it by "try" and "catch" somewhere.</p>
				<p>File input will be
					<span class="SpellE">similiar</span>
					to the console input. The difference lies in when you initialize the Scanner. 
					Console input initializes the Scanner class using (<span class="SpellE">System.in</span>) 
					as parameter. However, for file input, we use a <em>File</em> type parameter. 
					Class File is&nbsp;an abstract representation of file and directory pathnames. 
					One of the constructors of the File class is as follows:&nbsp;
					<span class="GramE">File(</span><span style="COLOR: blue">String</span>
					pathname). So we can create a File object using the following 
					statement&nbsp;for example:</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">File <span class="SpellE">inputFile</span>
= new <span class="GramE">File(</span>"input.txt");</span></p>
				<p><span class="GramE">This create</span>
					a new&nbsp;File object which opens a file&nbsp;in the working directory where 
					your java program runs, named "input.txt". Then we can use this as an input.</p>
				<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scanner
read = new Scanner (<span class="SpellE">inputFile</span>);</span></p>
				<p>This statement initializes the scanner just as how the Scanner object is created 
					for the console input. We can combine the two statements together as follows 
					which what we did in the
					<span class="SpellE">SavingCalculateTester</span>.</p>
				<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scanner
read = new Scanner (new <span class="GramE">File(</span>"input.txt"));</span><!--StartFragment --></p>

				<h2><i><span style="COLOR: purple">Formatted console output</span></i></h2>
				<p>In this program, you won't just be printing unformatted text to the console; 
					you'll also need to print integer values, right-justify monetary amounts, and 
					so on. For example, when you want to print a paycheck to the console, you'll 
					need, first, to format it so that it looks nice. As an example, you might print 
					a paycheck this way:</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paycheck for John Doe (hourly, $26.50/hr)</pre>
				<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hours Worked:<span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>40</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gross Pay:<span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>$1,060.00</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tax:<span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>$212.00</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Net Pay:<span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>$848.00</pre>
				<p>A clean way to do this is to first teach Paycheck objects how to format 
					themselves as Strings, then to print these Strings to the console using
					<span class="SpellE">
						<b>System.out.print</b></span>
					or
					<span class="SpellE">
						<b>System.out.println</b></span>. Java is set up to make this relatively 
					easy. First, you must write the following method in the Paycheck class:</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">public</span> String <span class="SpellE">toString</span>()</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>{</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// ...</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}</pre>
				<p>Of course, the comment would need to be replaced with code that builds and 
					returns a String representation of the Paycheck. Once that code is in place, if 
					you have a Paycheck object, you can print it directly to the console using
					<span class="SpellE">
						<b>System.out.println</b></span>:</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// <span class="GramE">Assume</span> that p is created appropriately.</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paycheck p = ...;</pre>
				<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// <span class="GramE">Whenever</span> you try to print an object to the console, Java</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp; </span><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>// automatically calls <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">toString</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>) on it, then prints the result</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// to the console for you.</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">System.out.println</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>p);</pre>
				<p>What we need to be able to do, then, is to write the appropriate code in the
					<span class="SpellE">toString</span>
					( ) method.</p>
				<p>Suppose that, instead of a paycheck, we want to print identifying information 
					about a person, formatted nicely. The
					<span class="SpellE">
						<b>String.format</b></span>
					<b>( )</b> method helps; it knows how to take data of various types, format it 
					according to your specifications, and return it to you as a String. The first 
					parameter you pass to it is called a <i>format string</i>, which is used to 
					tell it how you'd like the data to be formatted, with placeholders for the 
					data. Subsequent parameters specify the data that will replace the 
					placeholders. Here's an example from a hypothetical Person class:</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">public</span> String <span class="SpellE">toString</span>()</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>{</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>String s = "";</pre>
				<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>s += <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">String.format</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>"%-10s: %s\n", "Name", name);</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>s += <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">String.format</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>"%-10s: %s\n", "Title", title);</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>s += <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">String.format</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>"%-10s: %4d\n", "Height", height);</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>s += <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">String.format</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>"%-10s: %4d\n", "Weight", weight);</pre>
				<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">return</span> s;</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}</pre>
				<p>This code might generate the following output for a hypothetical person:</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Name<span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>: John Doe</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Title<span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>: CEO</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Height<span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>:<span >&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>71</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Weight<span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>:<span >&nbsp; </span>190</pre>
				<p>In the format string, each occurrence of the <b>%</b> character indicates a 
					placeholder for a piece of data. It is followed by a letter such as <b>s</b> (for 
					a String) or <b>d</b> (for an integer), with an optional number in front of it 
					that indicates justification (a positive number means to right-justify, while a 
					negative number means to left-justify). In the example code above, you can see 
					the placeholder <b>%-10s</b>, which means to print a String left-justified 
					within 10 characters (i.e. with extra space added after it so that it fills up 
					at least 10 characters). The placeholder <b>%4d</b> means to print an integer 
					right-justified within 4 characters (i.e. with extra space added before it, if 
					needed). The placeholder <b>%s</b> simply means to print a String, with no 
					extra spaces added before or after it.</p>
				<p>If the format string has two placeholders in it, as in the example code above, 
					you'll need to supply it with two parameters that supply the data. For example, 
					this line:</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>s += <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">String.format</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>"%-10s: %4d\n", "Height", height);</pre>
				<p>...tells the method to left-justify the text "Height" within 10 characters, 
					follow that by a colon and a space, and follow that with the integer height 
					right-justified within 4 characters. The <b>\n</b> you see at the end of the 
					format string says to insert a
					<span class="SpellE">newline</span>
					character, so that subsequent characters will appear on the next line when the 
					String is printed.</p>
				<p>This is a great tool that you can use to format your output to make it look 
					nice; I expect you to use it. If you want to make your paychecks look just like 
					the example paycheck I showed, feel free; if not, that's okay, too, but you are 
					required to justify your output so that it can be read easily. A good rule of 
					thumb is to right-justify the numbers so that they can easily be read from top 
					to bottom.</p>
				<p>I provided a method
					<span class="SpellE">
						<b>CurrencyFormat.format</b></span>
					<b>( )</b> that you can use to format an integer number of cents into a 
					dollars-and-cents form with a dollar sign and decimal point. You'll be writing
					<span class="SpellE">
						<b>toString</b></span>
					<b>( )</b> methods in the employee subclasses and Paycheck.</p>

				<h2><i><span style="COLOR: purple">Enumerations</span></i></h2>
				<p>You may have encountered a situation in a prior Java course in which you needed 
					a set of constants that were related to one another, such as the days of the 
					week. It's possible that you would have solved the problem by declaring a set 
					of integer constants with unique values:</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">public</span> static final <span class="SpellE">int</span> SUNDAY = 1;</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">public</span> static final <span class="SpellE">int</span> MONDAY = 2;</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">public</span> static final <span class="SpellE">int</span> TUESDAY = 3;</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">public</span> static final <span class="SpellE">int</span> WEDNESDAY = 4;</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">public</span> static final <span class="SpellE">int</span> THURSDAY = 5;</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">public</span> static final <span class="SpellE">int</span> FRIDAY = 6;</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">public</span> static final <span class="SpellE">int</span> SATURDAY = 7;</pre>
				<p>There are two problems with this approach. One is that the numeric values often 
					have no actual relevance in the program, other than the fact that they need to 
					be unique; there's no good reason that SUNDAY couldn't be 0 (or 4,000) instead. 
					Another - and this one is a lot more important! - is that any time you want to 
					declare a variable or parameter to store a "day of week" value, you have to 
					declare it to be of type <b>int</b>. This is not only counterintuitive, but 
					also opens up the very real possibility that the variable might eventually wind 
					up with a value other than one in the range 1..7, which could grind the program 
					to a halt if there isn't a lot of tedious error-checking code throughout.</p>
				<p>A better way to solve this problem that is available in Java 5.0 is to use an <i>enumeration</i>. 
					In its simplest form, an enumeration can be thought of as precisely a solution 
					to this problem: a way of expressing that a set of named constants is related 
					to one another. Rather than declaring them as separate constants of some 
					existing data type such as
					<span class="SpellE">
						<b>int</b></span>, they can be put together in an enumeration and become a 
					new type of data. For example:</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">public</span> <span class="SpellE">enum</span> <span class="SpellE">DayOfWeek</span></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>{</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SUNDAY,</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MONDAY,</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>TUESDAY,</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>WEDNESDAY,</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THURSDAY,</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>FRIDAY,</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SATURDAY</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}</pre>
				<p>(If you think that the numeric values from before are necessary for some reason, 
					that's no problem; they can be included if you wish. In fact, the values don't 
					even necessarily have to be integers. But when they are only used to 
					differentiate between the constants, they should not be included.)</p>
				<p>Once you've declared this enumeration, it becomes possible to have variables of 
					type
					<span class="SpellE">DayOfWeek</span>, which will only be allowed to have one 
					of the seven constant values listed above (or null). For example:</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// One of the constants can be directly assigned into a <span class="SpellE">DayOfWeek</span>.</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">DayOfWeek</span> d = <span class="SpellE">DayOfWeek.SUNDAY</span>;</pre>
				<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// A <span class="SpellE">DayOfWeek</span> can be a return value from a method.</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">DayOfWeek</span> d2 = <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">getCurrentDayOfWeek</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>);</pre>
				<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// <span class="GramE">We</span> can use <span class="SpellE">DayOfWeek</span> constants in comparisons, too!</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">if</span> (d2 == <span class="SpellE">DayOfWeek.MONDAY</span>)</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>{</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">System.out.println</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span>"Just another manic Monday.");</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}</pre>
				<pre><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// <span class="GramE">We</span> can even use them in switch statements.<span >&nbsp; </span>It's important to note that</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// when used in a switch statement, you aren't supposed to qualify the</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// names of the constants by putting "<span class="SpellE">DayOfWeek</span>." in front of them.<span >&nbsp; </span>Go</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// figure.</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">switch</span> (d2)</pre>

				<p>I've provided you with an enumeration called
					<span class="SpellE">PayrollCommand</span>, which is a set of all of the 
					commands that can be executed by the user. You won't need to define an 
					enumeration in this assignment, but you will need to manipulate
					<span class="SpellE">PayrollCommand</span>
					variables from time to time. The examples above, as well as the code I provided 
					in the starting point, demonstrate everything you'll need to know.</p>

				<h2><i><span style="COLOR: purple">Dealing with money properly</span></i></h2>
				<p>You'll probably notice that the methods that manipulate monetary amounts (e.g. 
					the
					<span class="GramE">format(</span>
					) method in the
					<span class="SpellE">CurrencyFormat</span>
					class) expect them to be stored as
					<span class="SpellE">
						<b>int</b></span>
					values. Your program is expected to be capable of dealing with money accurately 
					to the cent, which might make you wonder why I haven't used <b>double</b> values 
					instead.</p>
				<p>As far as our payroll program is concerned, cents are indivisible. In other 
					words, an employee will never be paid or taxed a fraction of a cent. The 
					primary problem with <b>double</b> values is that they may be
					<span class="GramE">inaccurate,</span>
					because of the way computers store floating-point numbers (i.e. numbers with 
					fractional parts). Through simple arithmetic, a small amount of error, such as 
					0.0000001, can easily be introduced into a calculation, which becomes a 
					nightmare to deal with when cents are meant to be indivisible.</p>
				<p><span class="GramE">So, rather than representing money using <b>double</b> values, your
program should use <span class="SpellE"><b>int</b></span> values, representing
numbers of cents.</span>
					For example, if an employee's hourly wage is $17.54, it should be stored as the
					<span class="SpellE">
						<b>int</b></span>
					value 1754. The
					<span class="SpellE">CurrencyFormat</span>
					class that I provided can be used to take care of formatting this value so that 
					it will appear as $17.54 when it's time to print it out to the console.</p>
				<p><STRONG><EM>[paragraph corrected 2/1/06:]</EM>&nbsp; </STRONG>It's up to you to 
					decide in what format the user will input the salary amount of the added 
					employee <EM>in the console-input version of your program</EM>.&nbsp; E.g. the 
					user can enter the salary in cents (an integer value) or dollars (a float or 
					double).&nbsp; However, <EM>in the file-input version of the program</EM>, i.e. 
					where all inputs are taken from the file input, we expect that the salary 
					amounts of the added employees are expressed in dollars, i.e. they can have a 
					decimal point.&nbsp; See the specification above of the input format in the 
					"AddEmployee" part of the description of how the input file should be handled, 
					and the inputfile.txt file attached there as an example.&nbsp; In particular, 
					the input salary is expected to look like 20.50, 20, or 20.00, without any 
					dollar signs.&nbsp; Note that you can read the input as a double value first, 
					and then use appropriate arithmetic manipulation, including rounding (because 
					e.g. value .01 when read as a double can be represented as .0999999...9 or 
					.01000...01, and you do not know which one it will be...), and casting to 
					convert this value read from the input to the integer representing the salary 
					in cents, which is the representation we suggest you should use throughout your 
					program. Check the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html">
					Double Class</a> description for some helpful methods for converting a string to a double.
					</p>
				<P>When calculating tax amounts and payment amounts, use integer division whenever 
					division is required,
					<span class="GramE">which will always round the amount down
when the result has a fraction of a cent.</span></P>

				<h2><i><span style="COLOR: purple">What to do about compiler warnings</span></i></h2>
				<p>When you compile your program from the command line, you may see the following 
					output:</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Note: <span class="SpellE">Blah.java</span> uses unchecked or unsafe operations.</pre>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Note: Recompile with -<span class="SpellE">Xlint<span class="GramE">:unchecked</span></span> for details.</pre>
				<p>This is not something that you should ignore. It usually means that you're not 
					using generics appropriately. Most often, it means that at least one use of a 
					generic class hasn't been given a type parameter (e.g. somewhere, you've said
					<span class="SpellE">
						<b>ArrayList</b></span>
					instead of
					<span class="SpellE">
						<b>ArrayList</b></span><b>&lt;String&gt;</b>). As far as we're concerned in 
					this course, this is as serious as a compile-time error and needs to be fixed. 
					To find out more about what the specific problems are, recompile your program 
					with this command:</p>
				<pre><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">javac</span></span> -<span class="SpellE">Xlint:unchecked</span> *.java</pre>
