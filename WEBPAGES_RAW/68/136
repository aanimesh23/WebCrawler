<h3>Course Resources</h3>

<p>
This course will be taught from <b>Introduction to Algorithms</b> by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. 
</p>

<p>
The Piazza forum for our class can be found <a href="https://piazza.com/class/iy13r4l0kcv3ob">here</a>. Course announcements, problem sets, and other resources will be posted there.
</p>

<p>
Questions about course material are best asked in person during class or office hours. Outside of these hours please try to ask questions on our Piazza forum. It is a great place for class discussion and helps other students with similar questions. You are also welcome to email me with any questions. Please include CS 140 somewhere in the subject of any emails addressed to me.

<h3>Grading Policy</h3>

<p>
Grades will be computed by a weighted combination of your problem sets, midterms, and final:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Problem Sets (40%)
<li> Midterm 1 (15%)
<li> Midterm 2 (15%)
<li> Final (30%)
</ul>

<p>
Letter grade conversions will be decided at the end of the course.
</p>

<h3>Problem Sets</h3>

<p>
The problem sets will be released weekly on <a href="https://piazza.com/class/iy13r4l0kcv3ob">the course Piazza forum</a> for our class under the resources tab. The problem sets will generally be due on the following Wednesday.
</p>

<p>
Collaborating with other students on the homework is highly encouraged, but copying answers is not okay.  Make sure everything you write down you understand and is in your own words.  Giving others credit for their contribution is important so please list anyone you collaborate with on the assignment.  For the first three homeworks you are required to type them up using latex.  After that you are welcome to hand write or type up your solutions.
</p>

<p>
Some homeworks will include optional challenge extra credit problems. Earning full credit will require thorough and correct answers.
</p>


<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>
The Pomona College policy on academic honesty can be found <a href="http://catalog.pomona.edu/content.php?catoid=7&navoid=394">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
All of the work you complete in this class should be your own.  Discussing course material at a high level is encouraged, however at no point should you share written or typed answers with other students.  Additionally, answers on exams and quizzes should be entirely your own work.  Exams will be closed-note and closed-book.
</p>
