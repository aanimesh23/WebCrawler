<H2>Setting JSDK 1.0.1 in the CLASSPATH on Solaris</H2>

<p>&nbsp;
This section provides an example of how to set up your downloaded JSDK 1.0.1
to be included it in the CLASSPATH environment variable.  CLASSPATH is the
environment used by the Java interpretor (JVM) to look for Java byte-code.
</p>

<p> Note: the tcsh shell was used for this example.</p>

<H3> Appending the CLASSPATH to include the JSDK byte-code files</H3>

<p> After you have uncompressed and un-tared the downloaded JSDK, you
will need to include the classes.zip file (located under the lib directory)
of the JSDK in your CLASSPATH environment variable.  
</p>

<p> You may use any technique you like to set the CLASSPATH.  In this 
example, we are using the setenv command to append the CLASSPATH.
The command will look like this:
<br>
<tt>setenv CLASSPATH $CLASSPATH':<i>path_to_JSDK_classes</i>'</tt>
<br>
Note: The ' quotes the string :path_to_JSDK_classes so that tcsh won't
interpret the colon symbol :.
</p>

<p> Note: the file classes.zip contains the Java byte-code for the JSDK.
The CLASSPATH should be set to that file. 
</p>

<p> You now have JSDK installed so that your Java interpretor can 
use it to run Chimera 2.0.
