<font size=+1><strong>How a Process Improvement Program Falls Apart, and How to Prevent It</strong><br>

How to survive the trend of reorganizations, mergers, management changes, 
and corporate takeovers and continue to retain an effective process focus 
is a challenge that may best be met at the "grass roots" level through 
collegial teams working to maintain their culture. This presentation 
defines the use of teams from multiple projects to define and implement 
a strong process improvement program that provides continuity over time. 
Team involvement in establishment of goals, development of training to 
support the process, evaluation of project metrics, and sharing lessons 
learned, all establish a culture of sharing that helps prevent 
deterioration when there are changes in management and new challenges 
in the marketplace.

<p>

Examples from process programs in place within various organizations are 
included, with emphasis on the Command and Control Systems (CCS) division 
of Raytheon Systems Company (formerly Hughes Aircraft Company). In this 
division a long-established culture of planning and managing software 
projects has led to a shared understanding of how projects "should" be 
organized and managed for greater effectiveness. The ongoing use of 
collegial teams to discuss process issues and lessons learned, propose 
solutions shared between projects, and implement process initiatives 
has proven to be successful in obtaining buy-in and enthusiasm.

engineering within Raytheon. Ms. Moon played a key role in defining the 
organization and focus of EPGs within Hughes Aircraft Company and the 
company-level process deployment approach. She has mentored process group 
personnel in many organizations. Jane has been a member of the CMM 
Integration (CMMI) Project, a key reviewer of both the software CMM and

Motorola has for several years been synonymous with quality worldwide. 
After several missed opportunities beginning in the early 1970's, the 
corporation was transformed by the Six Sigma Quality Initiative in the 
1980's. The enlargement of the Six Sigma program from it's origin in 
manufacturing to an enterprise wide initiative has been underway since 
1994 in the Space and Systems Technology Group. The benefits, techniques, 
successes and mistakes of this 30 year journey are summarized including 
an emphasis on software and systems engineering quality.

<p>

<strong>Biography:</strong>
Paul Dickerson graduated from Lamar State College with a BSME 
degree and obtained his MSME and MBA from Arizona State University. He 
has worked for Motorola Space and Systems Technology Group since 1965. 
He currently holds the position of Director of Continuous Quality 
Improvement - Space and Systems Technology Group and has also held the 
position of Director of Quality and Continuous Improvement - Satellite 
Communications Group. Paul has many awards including the Recipient of 
U.S. Army "Outstanding Civilian Award" for support while deployed to 
Kuwait Theater of Operations, February 1991, the Manager of the first 
program in Motorola to receive two CEO Quality Awards, and has designed 
an inexpensive, portable artificial kidney for the Arizona Kidney 
Foundation.
