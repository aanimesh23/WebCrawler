Fully Retroactive Approximate Range 
and Nearest Neighbor Searching
</h2>

<p>
We describe fully retroactive dynamic data structures
for approximate range reporting 
and approximate nearest neighbor reporting. We show
how to maintain, for any positive constant d, a set of n
points in R^d indexed by time such that we can perform
insertions or deletions at any point in the timeline in 
O(log n) amortized time. We support, for any small constant epsilon>0,
(1+ epsilon)-approximate range reporting queries at any point in the
timeline in O(log n + k) time, where k is the output size.
We also show how to answer (1+epsilon)-approximate nearest neighbor
queries for any point in the past or present in O(log n) time.
Joint work with Michael Goodrich.
