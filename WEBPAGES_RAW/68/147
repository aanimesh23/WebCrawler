E.g., a component'simplementation, a component's external interface, architecturetopology/component bindings?</p><p>What are the appropriate runtime change operations? Possibleoperations include: creating and destroying components andconnectors, establishing or tearing down communication links,replacing one component for another, hierarchically nesting andunnesting components, interposing and &quot;wrapping&quot;components?</p><p>How should architectural changes be described? Are the changeoperations implicit or explicit in the description?</p><p><strong>Applying Runtime Changes</strong></p><p>How should runtime changes be applied to the running system?One operation at a time, all at once (transactions), dependent onthe operation, ...</p><p>How do the change operations affect the runtime system? Arenew processes and threads created for each new component? Arethere new memory management issues? ...</p><p>How can a component's internal state be preserved andtransferred to its replacement?</p><p>What aspect of the architectural model should be deployed withthe system to support runtime change and analysis?</p><p>What triggers a runtime change? Explicitly requested byend-users, implicitly through system monitoring (self-adaptive)?</p><p><strong>Architectural Model to Implementation Mapping</strong></p><p>Most systems currently assume a one-to-one mapping betweenmodel and implementation elements. Is this adequate? Is it usefulto support one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many mappings aswell? Investigating techniques for architectural refinement (suchas <a href="references.html#MQR95">[MQR95]</a>) may be a goodstart.</p><p>How is the mapping from the architectural model to theimplementation specified?</p><p><strong>Relationship to Dynamic Languages (DLs)</strong></p><p>What techniques and tools can dynamic architecture researchersuse from DL researchers? </p><p>How are DLs different than/similar to dynamic architectures?</p><hr size="0" noshade><p>Return to the <a href="index.html">Dynamic SoftwareArchitectures home page</a>.<br>These pages are maintained by <a href="../">Peyman Oreizy</a>.Send comments via <a href="mailto:peymano at ics.uci.edu">e-mail</a>.</p></body></html>ï¿½
