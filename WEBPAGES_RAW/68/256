<H3>My Ph.D. Dissertation </H3>

I recently turned in my dissertation manuscript to the UCI library.
<br>
Here, I make available the following dissertation chapters:

Your feedback on form and content of these chapters is welcome!

<H3>Course Information </H3>

I teach two courses for
<a href="http://www.unex.uci.edu/~unex/">UCI Extension</a>,
one on object-oriented analysis and design,
the other on Windows NT/95 Programming using Visual C++ and MFC.
<BR>
Textbooks and syllabus for my Object-Oriented Analysis and Design course
are likely to change soon, in anticipation of new books on the
latest offering of OO methodologies, including
<BR>
<a href="http://www.csse.swin.edu.au/cotar/OPEN/OPEN.html">
The OPEN Consortium's OML</a>
and
<a href="http://www.rational.com/ot/ot.html">Rational's UML</a>.
<BR>
For Tysh, I enclose HTML versions of weeks 1 and 3 of my OOAD course,
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ziv/ooad/intro_to_se/index.htm">Week 1,</a>
<BR>
and
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ziv/ooad/classes/index.htm">Week3</a>.

<H3>Research Projects</H3>

I develop a hypertext browser, called 
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ivan/">IVAN</a>,
that affords better traceability of software systems by explicit
modeling of software uncertainties.
<BR>
This work is done as part of the
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/atUCI.html">Arcadia</a>
research project at
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">UC Irvine</a>.

<H3>Research Papers</H3>

Recently completed three papers on Bayesian-network modeling of
software engineering uncertainties.   
<BR>
The first is submitted to ICSM'97 conference, and is titled
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ziv/papers/icsm97.ps">
Constructing Bayesian-network models of software testing
and maintenance uncertainties</a>, also in Adobe PDF in
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ziv/papers/icsmadobe.pdf">
<BR>
The second is submitted to
<a href="http://rieska.oulu.fi/~hok/htf3cfp.htm">International
Workshop on Incorporating Hypertext Functionality into Software
Systems</a>, to be held in conjunction with the conference on
<a href="http://journals.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ht97/">Hypertext'97</a>.
This paper is available here in postscript form, under the title
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ziv/papers/hypertext97.ps">
Adding Uncertainty to Hypertext Models of Software Systems</a>.
<BR>
The second paper is submitted to
<a href="http://www.ifi.unizh.ch/congress/esec97.html">ESEC/FSE 97</a>
conference.  The paper is available in postscript form,
under the title
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ziv/papers/fsepaper.ps">
"Bayesian-network Confirmation of Software Testing Uncertainties."</a>
<BR>
The same paper in Adobe PDF format (for Acrobat 3.0) is in
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ziv/papers/fseadobe.pdf">
"Bayesian-network Confirmation of Software Testing Uncertainties."</a>
<BR>
Please treat all papers as draft submissions, since notification
of acceptance is not due until April 1997.
<BR>
A previous incarnation of this paper was submitted to
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/icse97/">ICSE 97</a>.
The paper in its original, 10-point font, two column style
as required by ICSE, is entitled
<BR>
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ziv/papers/icse97.ps">
"The Uncertainty Principle in Software Engineering."</a>
<BR>
Links to even earlier versions of this paper can also be found in the
collection of papers on

Automation</a>.

<H3>Professional Interests</H3>

I know a few things about software engineering, software testing,
process modeling, and object-oriented analysis and design.
I am also interested in Bayesian networks and uncertainty modeling,
particularly as they apply to software development.

<H3>Object-Oriented Techniques</H3>

I am familiar with leading methods for OO analysis and design,
including the latest work on the Unified
Modeling Language (UML) and the OPEN/MOSES effort.
<BR>
I am in fact a member of the
<a href="http://www.csse.swin.edu.au/cotar/OPEN/OPEN.html">
OPEN Consortium</a>.
<BR>
A good source of information on OO CASE Tools on the Web
can be found
<a href="http://osiris.sunderland.ac.uk/sst/casepages/tools.html">
Here</a>.
<BR>
In addition,
a collection of more than 2000 links about object-orientation
is available at these U.S. mirror sites:
<BR>
<a href="http://www.objenv.com/cetus/software.html">
Chicago, Illinois</a>
and
<a href="http://mini.net/cetus/software.html">
Provo, Utah</a>.

<H3>Bayesian Networks</H3>

I am interested in Bayesian networks.  There are a few quality pages
on this topic, including:
<BR>
<a href="http://www.afit.af.mil/Schools/EN/ENG/LABS/AI/BayesianNetworks/bayesianNetworks.html">AFIT AI Laboratory</a>
<BR>
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/ldc/WWW/bayes-net-research/bayes-net-research.html">Lonnie Chrisman's Roadmap to Bayesian Research</a>
<BR>
You can find a Bayesian Network Editor, implemented in Java, in the
<a href="http://www.nero.net/~nagarasr/bayesnet/">Bayesian Editor page</a>
<BR>
and the accompanying implementation of Bayesian updating,

<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fgcozman/Research/JavaBayes/Home/index.html">
JavaBayes</a>.

<H3>Other Interests</H3>
Besides the aforementioned professional interests, I like to
play soccer and tennis, hike, jog, swim, and play rollerhockey.
My favorite rollerhockey arena is the
<a href="http://inwinc.com/1004/">Irvine Hockey Club</a>.
<BR>
My favorite sport, however, is soccer.
A good place to look for the latest soccer information is the
<a href="http://espnet.sportszone.com/soccer/">ESPN Sports Zone Soccer</a>
web page.
For additional sports links, check with my friend

<H3>Getting started with HTML</H3>

UCI's Office of Academic Computing has put together
some pointers on
<A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/WWWdocs/localFAQ.html#HTML">
how to learn HTML</A>.
