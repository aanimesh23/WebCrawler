<P><BR />
  <FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>This assignment is due in lab on Monday, November 2.  If you haven't already, change your language level to Intermediate Student
  with Lambda before you begin.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(1)</B> Chapter 19 starts the book&#39;s
discussion of higher-order functions (functions as arguments).  Look at exercises 19.1.1 and 19.1.2; they should be easy for you now, so you don't have to write down the answers.</FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(2)</B> Chapter 20 continues with higher-order
  functions.  Do exercises 20.1.3, 20.2.1, 20.2.2, 20.2.3, and 20.2.4.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(3)  </B>Chapter 21 of the HtDP text starts
with an unusually clear design recipe for abstracting, or refactoring, functions.
It continues by introducing the predefined functions map, filter, and foldr (also known as reduce or accumulate); we'll talk about these in class on Tuesday. Do exercises 21.1.1., 21.1.2, 21.2.2 (pick just one of the three parts), 21.2.3.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(4)</B>  Chapter 22 of HtDP has a section
that introduces graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  We won&#39;t be doing GUIs explicitly this quarter, but
if you&#39;re intrigued with the GUI-building tools in DrScheme, note that
the gui.ss teachpack  works differently from the description in section
22.3 of the printed text.  You can look up the current gui.ss teachpack documentation
in the Help Desk.  (DrScheme also has a full-blown set of GUI operations,
but they&#39;re not in the student languages.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(5)</B>  We&#39;re not doing Chapter 23.
 It&#39;s interesting, and functional programming is beautifully suited
to mathematical problems, but there are only so many hours in the quarter.
 If you&#39;re interested, come back to this chapter over the winter break.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(6)  </B>Intermezzo 4 (Chapter 24) talks
about lambda, which you know already.  Do exercises 24.0.8 and 24.0.9.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(7)</B>  All the programs we&#39;ve written
so far have done their work, displayed their results, and quit without leaving
a trace.  Now it&#39;s time to learn how to read data from a file and write
results back to a file so we can maintain information more permanently,
even when our program isn&#39;t running.  For a programming language to
enable file input and output, it must work with the operating system (or
multiple operating systems) to handle a variety of issues involving different
user interfaces, different ways of storing data in files, different naming
conventions for files, and different hardware devices.  Because there are
many options, there are details to consider when we work with files that
we haven&#39;t had to worry about so far.</FONT></P>
<P>
  <FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>There are three main approaches to reading
    from and writing to files of text.  (Reading and writing data directly in
    the internal form the computer uses to store it in memory is yet another
approach, one we&#39;ll skip over for now.)</FONT></P>
<ul>
  <li>
    <FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Read and write a single character
      at a time.  If you read each character individually, you have the most precise
      control over how you analyze the input and build up the data structures
      in your program.  But this approach is the most painstaking and tedious.
      You may cover some techniques for organizing this process in ICS H22, but
    we won&#39;t use it this quarter.</FONT></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Read each line of the file
      into a string, perhaps collecting the strings into a list representing the
      whole file.  Then you could process the list conventionally, processing
      each string using Scheme&#39;s string functions.  This week we&#39;ll do
    some of this.</FONT></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Write all the data as Scheme
      expressions, and read it back in the same way.  If your program&#39;s data
      is organized into lists of structures and so on, you can preserve all of
      that organization using this approach.  This is the easiest approach in
      many ways, since you&#39;re maintaining the structure of the data and letting
      Scheme do a lot of the work for you.  We&#39;ll see this approach in later
    assignments.</FONT></li>
</ul>
