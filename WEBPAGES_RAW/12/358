<p>
Code size is a critical concern in many embedded system applications,
especially those using RISC cores. One promising
approach for reducing code size is to employ a "dual instruction
set", where processor architectures support a normal
(usually 32 bit) Instruction Set, and a narrow, space efficient
(usually 16 bit) Instruction Set with a limited set of
opcodes and access to a limited set of registers. This feature
(termed rISA) can potentially reduce the code size by up to
50% with minimal performance degradation. However, contemporary
processors incorporate only a simple rISA feature
with severe restrictions on register accessibility. We present
a Compiler-in-the-loop Design Space Exploration framework
that is capable of exploring various interesting rISA designs.
We also present experimental results using this framework
and show rISA designs that improve on the code size reduction
obtained by existing rISA architectures.
