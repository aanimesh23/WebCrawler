<EM><strong><font size=+1>Enterprise Java Beans: A Java Server Component Architecture</em></strong></em><br>

Bob Pasker, Chief Architect/Founder,
<a href="http://www.weblogic.com/">WebLogic, Inc.</a>,

</font>

<p>

Up until this year, Java was, for the most part, a client-side programming 
tool for spicing up web pages, and building thin-client products. With the 
advent of EJB, server-side Java moves into the mainstream. This talk 
presents the EJB component architecture, and describes how developers can 
build robust, scalable server systems in Java in a platform-, database-, 
and application server-independent fashion.

<p>
