<h1> <center> Call for Southern California SPIN Sponsor/Host </center></h1>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
</P>
<P>28 September 1999</P>
<P></P>
<P>Dear Potential Sponsor:</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Southern California SPIN is currently in search of a
new sponsor after 7.5 years of association with the Irvine Research Unit in
Software (IRUS) at UCI.  Recent changes at UCI have made it necessary to
end the relationship between SPIN and IRUS.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>The SPIN Steering Committee Search Subcommittee would
like you to consider entering a bid to become our new sponsor.  We have
prepared a list of points for you to cover in your bid presentation, along
with costs/hour estimates (reflecting recent SPIN activity).  Please see
APPENDICES B and C.  The Search Subcommittee feels that following these
outlines will provide both the potential sponsor and SPIN the opportunity
to evaluate any potential long-term relationship. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The SPIN Steering Committee Search Subcommittee has set
the following steps for our sponsor search:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Appoint a search subcommittee to drive the search
selection</LI>
<LI>Furnish each potential sponsor with a list of points
to cover in their presentation</LI>
<LI>Furnish each potential sponsor with cost/hour
estimates on tasks performed by current sponsor</LI>
<LI>Schedule a tour by the Search Subcommittee of the
proposed sponsor facility </LI>
<LI>Potential sponsors participate in presentations and
interviews with SPIN Steering Committee</LI>
<LI>SPIN Steering Committee selects the new sponsor </LI>
<LI>Announcement of the new sponsor of the Southern
California SPIN at the December 3, 1999 meeting.</LI></UL>

<P></P>
<P>Sponsor presentations and interviews will be conducted
by the SPIN Steering Committee on Friday, 29 October 1999, after the usual
morning SPIN meeting.  Voting for the new SPIN sponsor will be conducted in
early November with the new sponsor being announced at the December
3<SUP>rd</SUP> SPIN meeting.  A detailed schedule of events, plus contact
information for scheduling your presentation and facility tour, can be
found in APPENDIX A.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Thank you very much for your interest and participation.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Sincerely yours,</P>
<P></P>

SPIN Steering Committee Leader</P>
