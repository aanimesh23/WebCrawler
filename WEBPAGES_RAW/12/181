<h1>   
Online Sorted Range Reporting 
</h1>
<h2>  by Gerth St�lting Brodal, Rolf Fagerberg, Mark Greve, and Alejandro L�pez-Ortiz <h2>
<h2> To appear at ISAAC '09 (International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation)</h2>
<h2> Presented by Darren StrashUC Irvine</h2>


<p>

Consider the following one-dimensional range reporting problem: given an array A
of n elements, report the k smallest elements in the subarray A[i..j] in sorted order.
We present a data structure in the RAM model that supports such queries in O(k)
time, using O(n) words of memory, and O(n log n) preprocessing time. We also
discuss how to extend this result to the online version of the problem.
