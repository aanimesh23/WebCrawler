		<DIV>I've spent most of my life in Kyiv, Ukraine. I speak Russian, 
		     Ukrainian, English, and a bit German. I 
		     like to spend my time with <A HREF="http://www.shestakova.com/">Anna</A>, 
		     <A HREF="http://www.e1os.org/~anton/photo/2010-04%20-%20New%20Jersey/DSC_4037_mr.html">Sophia</A>, and 
		     <A HREF="http://www.e1os.org/~anton/photo/2012-09%20-%20San%20Diego/DSC_2740_lr.html">Lev</A>. 
		     Anna never updates her web page, but she finished her PhD at the University of Utah. After being 
                     a postdoctoral fellow for several years, she is now a medical resident at the University of California Irvine. 
                     Our kids Sophia and Lev often work as a team (we're lucky) and in general know how to enjoy life.

		<DIV>I moved to Utah from Kiev, Ukraine, where I was a
		     graduate student at the Institute for Applied System
		     Analysis at the <A HREF="http://www.ntu-kpi.kiev.ua/eng/index.php">National
		     Technical University of Ukraine "Kyiv Polytehnic Institute"</A> (Complete education
		     <A HREF="./education.html">history</A>). In Ukraine I worked with 
		     <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~leonidr">Leonid Ryzhyk</a>. We were 
		     full of naive but interesting ideas. We spent several years working on the <A HREF="http://www.e1os.org">E1 distributed operating system</A> project.
