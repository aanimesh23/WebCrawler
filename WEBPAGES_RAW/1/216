<A NAME = "Description"><H2>Project Description</H2>

<P>
The Teamware process support system is designed to improve team coordination 
and managerial control of software development teams. Teamware allows users 
to explicitly define their software development process and provides 
extensive execution support. In addition, Teamware is designed for 
non-technical as well as technical users, and is appropriate for use by 
managers, programmers, domain experts, and customer representatives. 
It also provides support for company-, site-, or project-specific 
customization.
</P>

<P>
During process execution, Teamware provides a summary of assignments for 
each team member. As each assignment is completed, Teamware informs 
appropriate managers and team members, and updates the shared project view. 
It also coordinates handoff of artifacts, tool interaction, and resource 
assignments. Further automation can be provided depending on the user's 
environment. This automation can include, for example, automatic invocation 
of tools, automated forwarding of documents to reviewers, or interaction 
with metrics gathering tools.
</P>


<A NAME = "Features"><H2>
Summary of System Features
</H2>
<ul>
<li><b>Support for Non-Technical Personnel</b> - The language and system are 
designed to support non-technical users as well as technical users. 
Non-technical managers, domain experts, accounting, marketing, and support 
staff are able to both read and write programs using the Teamware language.

<li><b>Company, Site, or Project Customizable</b> - Companies or projects 
can customize Teamware to meet their specific needs. New activity, artifact, 
and resource types can be defined.

<li><b>Facilitates Integration with External Tools</b> - Teamware's object 
model is designed to facilitate integration with any external tools providing 
an API. Teamware's agenda tool and default mail system, for example, can be 
replaced with the time-management and mail systems preferred by a particular 
site. In addition, meeting room schedulers, project management tools, and other 
site-specific tools can be integrated in using the object model.

<li><b>Object-Oriented</b> - Teamware's activity, artifact, and resource 
definitions are object-oriented. Users can create new definitions which 
inherit the properties of existing definitions.

<li><b>Multiple-Viewing Formalisms Supportable</b> - While Teamware provides 
a default view of the process similar to PERT charts, it also provides an API 
allowing access for viewing and editing using other viewers. Future viewers are 
planned including IDEF. In addition, users can define their own viewers.

<li><b>Dynamic Response to Project Changes</b> - Teamware provides flexibility 
as the project changes. Teamware activities, activity networks, and activity, 
artifact, and resource types can be changed dynamically as the process 
executes.
</ul>

<A NAME = "Definition"><H2>
Process Definition in Teamware
</H2>

<p>
Teamware allows definition of the activities, artifacts, and resources 
associated with the software development process. These items can be defined 
hierarchically, thus an activity can be further subdivided into subactivities, 
while a software development team resource can be further defined to include 
team member resources or subteam resources. In addition, Teamware activity 
networks define the interelationships between activities, artifacts, and 
resources. Networks include definition of control flow, data flow, and 
resource assignments. Teamware's default activity network viewer provides 
a PERT-like view of the activities, however additional viewers can be defined 
using Teamware's API. An IDEF0 viewer, for example, is planned.
</p>

<p>
Teamware provides a high degree of extensibility and flexibility in process 
definitions. Teamware provides object-oriented hierarchies of activity, 
artifact, and resource categories. Users can customize or extend the existing 
categories to meet their specific needs. Thus, if a company uses a different 
e-mail system than mh (Teamware's default system), a new e-mail system can 
be easily integrated. Similarly, if a project needs a new resource type 
not found in Teamware, the existing resource hierarchy can be extended.

<h2><A NAME = "Platform">
Platform
</h2>

<p>
The initial implementation of Teamware has been developed running Sun OS 4.2 
or higher. It utilizes Sun Ada, gcc, and 
<A HREF="http://www.python.org/">Python</A>. 
API's are provided for both 
Ada and Python. Default viewers provided are built on top of the ARPA-sponsored 
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/Chiron/chiron.html">Chiron User Interface Management System</A>.
</p>

<h2><A NAME = "Availability"> 
Availability
</h2>

<p>
Teamware is public domain software with full source distribution.
Teamware-1.1 is written completely in 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/">Java</A>(tm) and is set for release
on the web sometime in the second quarter, 1996.
Object handlers are currently supported in Python and Java; support
for Ada95 and Tcl are currently underway. 

If you are interested in becoming a beta-tester,
