Union find problem:
	maintain partition of some elements into sets
	each set has "id" by which it can be identified
	operations:
	    - add new element in its own set
	    - find id of set containing given element: find(x)
		- test if two elements are in same set (find(x)==find(y))
		- test if element belongs to set (find(x)==setid)
	    - merge two sets: union(x,y)

Applications:
    - Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm

	for each edge (u,v) in G, in sorted order by weight
		if u and v are in different components
			add (u,v) to T and merge their components

	partition into sets = connected components of partial tree
	test if in different components = find
	add and merge = union

	note in general more finds than unions

    - "Blossom contraction" method for finding maximum matchings
	in arbitrary graphs (see e.g. web site for Python impl)

    - Image segmentation (scan image in preferred pixel or quadtree
	order, find connected components, instead of DFS or BFS
	orders with messier memory access patterns)

    - Offline LCA:
	given T, set of LCA queries, answer all queries
	    depth first traversal of tree
	    at each step, maintain set of off-path descs of each path node
	    handle query lca(u,v) when visiting second of two vertices

Analysis parameters
	n elements per set
	so < n unions

	m finds (possibly m >> n)


Solution 1: fast queries
    each node stores id of the set containing it
    union: change stored ids in one of two sets

    so also need list of objects in each set

    find = O(1) time
    how to make unions efficient?
	union by size:
	    change ids in the smaller of the two sets
	    node id changes => node becomes member of set >=2*size
		so <= log_2 n changes per node

    amortized time: O(m + n log n)


Solution 2: fast finds
    store each set in the partition as a rooted tree
	id of set = tree root (one of the elements in the set)

    find(x): trace path from x to its root
    union(x,y): add tree edge from find(x) to find(y)

    so we want the tree to be short
    union by size again: add edge from find(x)->find(y) or vice versa,
	smaller subtree root to larger subtree root
    then, each step up tree doubles size of subtree
	=> path lengths <= log_2 n

    amortized time: O(m log n)

Further improvement: path compression

    union changes sets
    find is just a query

    but what if (like splay) we allow finds to change the trees?

    when we find a long path from node to root,
	don't want to repeat all that work again
		=> change all parent pointers along path to point to root

Path compression analysis

    define rank(x) = log_2 # descs(x)
	in tree formed by performing all unions but no path compressions
	so at most n/2^r nodes have rank r

    time for m unions on n items can be split into three parts:
	find steps from one high rank element to another (HH)
	find steps from one low rank element to another (LL)
	find steps from low to high rank and union steps (LH+X)

    also note that each element has at most one find that includes
    both LL and HH steps (after that all LL ancestor edges are compressed out)

    Let
	m_0 = # finds that have HH steps
        n_i = # elements in i'th group of low-rank items
	m_i = # finds in i'th group of low-rank items that have no HH steps
		(i > 0)
    so sum m_i = m, sum n_i = n, n_i < 2^r

    Then
	#(LH+X) = O(m+n)	(obvious, one per update or query)
	#(HH) = T(m_0,n/2^r)
	#(LL in group i) = T(m_i + n_i, n_i)  (m_i + one LLHH find per item)

    It will turn out that smaller groups of low-rank items only make
    the algorithm run faster, so in the worst case we can assume n_i = 2^r

    Putting this together into a recurrence describing the total time:
	T(m,n) = O(m + n) + T(m_0, n/2^r) + sum T(m_i + 2^r, 2^r)

    example of playing with this recurrence:

	start from
	T(m,n) = O(m + n log n) (total # compresses per item <= depth)

	    substitute in recurrence, using r = log log n
	    second term becomes linear
	    =>  T(m,n) = O(m + n) + sum T(m_i,log n) = O(m log^* n)

        log^*(n) = min_i i{2^(2^(2^...)) >= n

        very slowly growing

    actual solution to the recurrence:
	T(m,n) = O(m alpha(m,n))
    where
	A(1,j) = 2j
	A(j,1) = 2
	A(i,j) = A(i-1,A(i,j-1)) for i,j>1

	2   4   6   8  10  12  14  16
	2   4   8  16  32  64 128 256
	2   4  16 2^16...

	alpha(m,n) = min { i >= 1 | A(i,floor(m/n)) >= m }

	incredibly slowly growing...

So union find takes very close to constant time per operation
    but not constant!
    can find sequences of operations causing it to take
    Omega(m alpha(m,n)) time

    more, Omega(m alpha(m,n)) is lower bound in natural models of computation
