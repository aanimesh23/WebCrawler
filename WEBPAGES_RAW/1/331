Lower Bounds for External Memory Dictionaries<br>
Kevin Wortman</h2>

<p>We study trade-offs between the update time and the query time for
comparison based external memory dictionaries.  The main contributions
are two lower bound trade-offs between the I/O complexity of member
queries and insertions.  For both lower bounds we describe data
structures which give matching upper bounds for a wide range of
parameters, thereby showing the lower bounds to be tight within these
ranges.</p>
