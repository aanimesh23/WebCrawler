       2.   Abstract

          This document defines goals for  an access control system for use
          with the WebDAV protocol.

          Access control systems grant or deny rights (such as "read" or
          "write") to specified principals for individual resources.

          INTERNET-DRAFT           DAV ACLs Goals               August 1998

       4.   Introduction

       4.1. Problem to be solved

          In distributed authoring scenarios resources may be accessible by
          multiple principals. To control how these principals can access
          and alter a resource a system of access controls is needed. These
          controls define what actions a particular principals is allowed
          to exercise on a particular resource.

          There does not currently exist a mechanism for DAV to be used to
          grant and deny such access rights.  This document outlines the
          goals for such a method.

       5.   Definitions

          Most terminology in this document is used in the same way as in
          the WebDAV specification [1].

       5.1. Access Control List and Entries

          An Access Control List (ACL) usually refers to a collection of
          Access Control Entries (ACE).  Each entry applies to one or more
          principals and (usually) one object and/or its children.  Each
          entry grants or denies one or more rights to the specified
          principals on that object.  While this is a common model, it is
          applied differently in various existing stores (see 5.4).

          It is not required that the DAV access control draft use the
          model of ACL as defined by existing stores.  This draft refers to
          ACLs and ACEs because many systems use them, and in order to
          provide examples for some recommendations and goals.

       5.2. Principal

          A principal is a user or group of users to whom specific access
          rights can be granted or denied.

       5.3. Scenarios

          These are scenarios that SHOULD be accommodated by an access
          control mechanism for DAV.  These are all possible multi-author
          and distributed-author scenarios.  These scenarios were used to
          build the goals list.

       5.3.1.    Different authors on each document

          Jim owns a directory of documents which must be edited by a
          variety of different people, in fact a different set of people
          for each document.  He must be able to set access permissions
          individually for each document, so that only the correct editors
          have write access to each document.

       5.3.2.    Denying to member of a group

          Lippert                                                    [Page 3]
          INTERNET-DRAFT           DAV ACLs Goals               August 1998

          Lisa administers a bunch of files which can all be read by
          members of a group.  However, one of them contains details about
          a surprise party for Josh.  Lisa must be able to set the
          permissions on that document such that even though the group is
          allowed access to the document, Josh cannot read the document.
          This scenario is best served if new members can be added to the
          group and be able to read the document automatically.

       5.3.3.    Delegation

          Jim wishes to delegate some administration of his directory to
          Rohit.  First, Jim must be able to allow Rohit to read ACLs and
          write resources without being able to write ACLs on those
          resources.  Second, when Rohit is more trusted, Jim must be able
          to allow Rohit to edit the ACLs on the directory and on all
          resources in the directory, without giving Rohit the ability to
          take over entirely from Jim by removing all permissions from Jim.

       5.4. Interoperability

          DAV implementations will in some cases be built on top of
          existing access control implementations, e.g. file systems. Many
          access permission features can be built on top of the underlying
          store, however DAV access permissions will be more secure if the
          store's access permission functionality is used.

          Some common features of file systems with access control:

           - Associate each combination of a resource, a principal and a
          right with a "yes/no" decision whether the principal gets the
          right on the resource
           - Offer read, write and execute access to files
           - Principals include concept of "all users"
           - Some have more detailed rights such as "set owner", "set ACL",
          "synchronize"
           - May offer a different set of rights on directories (as opposed
          to files)
           - May allow access to be denied as well as granted
           - Groups can be principals as well as users
           - May have an "owner" for resources (the owner can have read or
          write permission removed, but can never be denied permission to
          take over the resource, set ACLs and restore permissions).
           - Has rules for either avoiding conflicting access entries or
          evaluating access entries in some consistent way to resolve
          conflict
           - May have inheritance rules

       6.   Goals
       6.1. Functionality

          Principals with the appropriate rights must be able to read and
          set access control information.

       6.2. Specifying principals

          Lippert                                                    [Page 4]
          INTERNET-DRAFT           DAV ACLs Goals               August 1998

          Principals MUST be uniquely identifiable.

          It MUST be possible to use a the octet strings which are defined
          by HTTP 1.1 [2] to identify a principal.

          It must also be possible to specify special types of principals,
          in particular all authorized principals, all anonymous
          principals, and all principals.

       6.3. Rights

          It MUST be possible to grant or deny the following rights to any
          principal

           - to alter the body of a resource
           - to alter the properties of a resource
           - to delete a resource
           - to add a child to a collection
           - to read the ACL on a resource or collection
           - to change the ACL on a resource or collection
           - to delete a child from a collection
           - to list the contents of a collection

       6.4. Granularity of Objects

          It must be possible to set ACLs individually on both collections
          and resources.

       6.5. Evaluating rights

          The protocol draft must provide an algorithm by which conflicts
          between rights, both granted and denied, for a particular
          principal on a particular resource are unambiguously settled.

       6.6. Discovery

          The protocol draft must specify how clients discover what rights
          are available on a resource as well as what rights have been
          assigned to which principals for a particular resource. Discovery
          is itself subject to access control.

       6.7. Security

          It should be acceptable to deny unprotected transactions.

       7.   Recommendations

       7.1. Functionality goals

          It is recommended that users be able to add access control
          information to an object without having to reset all access
          control settings.  This is recommended because certain systems or
          implementations may allow a user to add certain kinds of access
          rights but not others (i.e. grant "read" but not grant "delete").

          Lippert                                                    [Page 5]
          INTERNET-DRAFT           DAV ACLs Goals               August 1998

          Similarly, it should be possible for users to be able to remove,
          delete or clear access rights without having to reset all rights.

       7.2. Achieving predictability

          Users SHOULD be able to predict what rights another user has,
          based on looking at the DAV access rights granted and denied.
          This may be impossible if another user has access to the resource
          without using DAV, in which case other access control mechanisms
          may apply.  The underlying implementation may have advanced
          access control which is more restrictive than the DAV access
          control.

          There are several issues which much be dealt with carefully in
          order to maintain as much predictability as possible.

       7.2.1.    Evaluation Rules

          Precise evaluation rules, with no ambiguity, are needed to
          achieve predictability.

       7.2.2.    Inheritance

          If the underlying system uses inheritance, then users of the DAV
          access control mechanism should still be able to predict its
          behavior.  This could be achieved if the type of inheritance is
          discoverable, or if the type(s) of inheritance is/are specified
          by the DAV access control protocol draft.

       7.2.3.    Ownership

          Systems in which resources have owners also must be treated with
          care.  Predictability can be achieved on systems with owners by
          including owner functionality in DAV access control.  Systems
          which do not support owner functionality could refuse requests to
          change or set ownership.

          There may be other ways to preserve predictability with
          inheritance and ownership.

       8.   Areas Out of Scope
       8.1. Groups

          Modeling groups is out of scope.  There is currently no concept
          of groups to deal with in HTTP [2] or DAV.  The protocol draft
          MAY support specifying (naming) groups which already exist on a
          given underlying system.  It is recommended that the protocol
          draft avoid issues such as the enumeration of group members or
          administration of groups.

       8.2. Roles

          Those with experience building complex document management or
          workflow systems on top of stores with simple ACLs know how hard

          Lippert                                                    [Page 6]
          INTERNET-DRAFT           DAV ACLs Goals               August 1998

          it is to define roles for individuals. For example, the document
          management system can map the role "author" to grant the rights
          read/write/delete, but it is more difficult to go the other way.
          Is an individual with read/write/delete permissions an author, an
          editor, or somebody with no role and just a list of rights?  Many
          systems employ the concept of assigning roles, more temporary
          than identities, to more flexibly define access.

          Roles are important. However, roles would appear to be difficult
          and not necessarily related to ACLs.  The protocol draft MAY
          define how roles may be assigned.

       8.3. Certificate-based security

          Certificates are out of scope for the DAV ACL protocol.

       8.4. Time-based access control

          Time-based access control is out of scope for the DAV ACL
          protocol.

       9.   SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

          This document is intended to specify how security can be enhanced
          in WebDAV systems.  Many security considerations have already
          been discussed in [1].

          Authentication mechanisms, which will be used by DAV ACL
          implementations to identify principals, are defined elsewhere for
          HTTP 1.1 [2].  The same goals for security identified in [1],
          such as not using the HTTP Basic authentication scheme, apply
          even more strongly when access control functionality is
          considered.

          Inappropriate implementations or use of access control
          functionality can make a system less secure in these ways:

           - by potentially allowing non-administrators to change the
          access settings for items on a server,

           - by providing a way for access control information to be read
          and set (may be snooped), and potentially snooped, hackers may
          find it easier to discover names of accounts to use in attacks.

          The "Security" goals section (6.7) includes some goals to
          counterbalance these insecurities.  Also, the ability to specify
          who has access rights to read and to change the rights themselves
          (section 6.3) lessens the chance of hackers being able to learn
          access information or set access levels.

          Access control functionality also improves security, by giving
          resource owners much more control and flexibility over who can
          access their resources in what way.
