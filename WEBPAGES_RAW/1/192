Projects:</a> Closest Pairs</h1>

I have been working for some time on data structures for
maintaining closest pairs of objects, as objects are dynamically
inserted or deleted. Here "objects" might be any of a number of
things (points in a vector space; clusters of points; DNA
sequences; ridges, valleys, and other features of the roof of a
building...) and "closest" may have its usual geometric meaning or
may be determined by some arbitrary function of the objects. 

<p>My methods generally assume the existence of another data
structure, for finding the closest object in a dynamic set to a
given query object. This can be solved in general in O(<i>n</i>)
distance computations per query (just keep a list of all objects,
and try them all) but for objects arising in computational geometry
better solutions are possible (k-D trees for points, more
complicated range search data structures for other geometric
objects).</p>
