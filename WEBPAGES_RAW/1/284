	    In February 2012 I completed a PhD in computer science at the
	    University of California, Irvine. 
	    My advisor was <a href="http://ics.uci.edu/~emj/">Eric
	      Mjolsness</a>.
            The main webpage for Eric's research group is 
            <a href="http://computableplant.ics.uci.edu/index.html">Computable
            Plant</a>.

	  My research interests are in machine learning, artificial
	  intelligence, and computational biology. 
          <br/> <br/>
          My PhD thesis focused on two novel approaches in probabilistic
          graphical
	  models. Each of these is described on its
	  own page. Each page also includes links to download software
	  packages for the Mathematica programming langauge, and
	  example notebooks. 
          <br/><br/><a href="http://computableplant.ics.uci.edu/sw/dd/">Dependency
	  Diagrams</a> extend  
          factor graphs (a superset of Bayesian networks and Markov
          random fields). I used them to implement a package that,
          among other things, automatically generates runnable source
          code for the process of performing Metropolis-Hastings
          sampling on arbitrary
	  distributions. <br/><br/>
          <a href="http://computableplant.ics.uci.edu/sw/gccd/">Graph-Constrained   
	    Correlation Dynamics</a> formalizes a method of
	  representing probability distributions that evolve
	  continuously in time. The software package leverages
	  Dependency Diagrams to optimize GCCD models. 
          <br/><br/> 
          My thesis is also available as a 
          <a href="johnson.todd-thesis.pdf">PDF</a>.

        selected side projects <br/>
        <ul>
          <li>I wrote this implementation of parallel 
            <a href="http://computableplant.ics.uci.edu/sw/ldsa/">Lam-Delosme
	      simulated annealing</a> for statistical numerical
	        optimization in 
	    Mathematica.</li> 
          <li>I implemented 
	    a <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/milch/blog/">Bayesian
	    Logic</a> model 
	    that 
            <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dorendor/basket.pdf">predicts  
	      the outcomes of basketball games</a>. This required
	    implementing an 
	    approximate Gibbs sampler for BLOG, making me (according to
	    Brian Milch) maybe the first person outside of his and
	    Russell's research groups to implement a custom proposer 
	    class for BLOG. If this is something you need to do, I would
	    be happy to talk about the process.</li>
