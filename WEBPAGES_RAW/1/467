&gt;| When a user "checks out" a document for editing,
&gt;| the revision contrl system "should" record who it
&gt;| is that is checking out the document so that when
&gt;| the same user attempts to "check in" the document
&gt;| there is a mechanism to say "Hey, remember me? I am
&gt;| checking in the document that I previously checked out
&gt;| for editing. Here it is." The RCS can verify that it is
&gt;| the same user that is recorded and proceed, or reject
&gt;| the action if it is not the same user.
&gt;|
&gt;
&gt;Very close, except I'm not asserting that the revision control system
&gt;_should_ record anything when a user starts to edit a document.  Instead,
&gt;I say that there are many systems that _do_ record something, and that
&gt;HTTP _should_ cart around a token ("or cookie" ) of this recorded
&gt;information.

Right.  I quoted "should" to indicate that it was a goo idea,
not a requirement. The cookie, in this case, is like a certificate
that lets the user know that the transaction was completed and
that the document has officially been checked out.
&gt;
&gt;For something like RCS or CVS, the cookie might be only a name and rev
&gt;of the document.  For Clearcase or Perforce, the cookie might be an
&gt;inscrutable pointer to info in its database.  For less version-stringent
&gt;systems, there may be no cookie at all.

I would think that the cookie should only contain the most 
basic of information, such as a pair of values to validate
the check out (an ID) and a record of the cookie that was issued.
The RCS could, at its discretion, maintain a database of the
pointer into the database etc.
&gt;
&gt;| Christopher is asserting that a "cookie" is the best,
&gt;| if not the only, way to manage the session.
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps there is another way?

Certainly the document itself could carry information
along with it, in a META tag or on any tag that we can
legitimately propose. This would allow arbitrary 
authoring tools to have access to whatever information
the RCS provides -- without having to inspect any cookies
that might be associated with the document. I am including 
Notepad in my definition of arbitrary authoring tools.
For debugging purposes, I think that it will be useful
to carry info in the document.
