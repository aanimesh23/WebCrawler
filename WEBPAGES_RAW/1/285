<h2>7 Mar 1997:<br>
Fault Tolerant Data Structures<br>
<a href="/~josephw/">Joseph Wang</a>, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

<p>This talk is based on the FOCS 96 paper from Y. Aumann and M.
Bender. The authors showed fault tolerant versions of three common
data structures. In this talk, we will cover fault tolerant
versions of stack and the linked list in detail.</p>

<p>Paper Abstract:</p>

<p>We consider the tolerance of data structures to memory faults.
We observe that many pointer-based data structures (e.g. linked
lists, trees, etc.) are highly nonresilient to faults. A single
fault in a linked list or tree may result in the lost of the entire
set of data. In this paper we present a formal framework for
studying the fault tolerance properties of pointer-based data
structures, and we provide fault tolerant versions of the stack,
the linked list, and the dictionary tree.</p>
