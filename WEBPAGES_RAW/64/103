The    scenario will help you understand the more abstract    description of the mechanism below. </em></p></blockquote><h3>Applicability</h3><blockquote>    <p><em>What are the situations in which the mechanism can be    applied? What are examples of poor designs that the mechansim    can address? How can you recognize these situations? </em></p>    <ul>        <li><em>An applicable situation </em></li>    </ul></blockquote><h3>Participants</h3><blockquote>    <p>The elements participating in the mechanism and their    responsibilities. </p>    <ul>        <li>Participant Name: Responsibility for what </li>    </ul></blockquote><h3>Collaborations</h3><blockquote>    <p>How the participants collaborate to carry out their    responsibilities. </p>    <ul>        <li>[Collaboration] </li>    </ul></blockquote><h3>Consequences</h3><blockquote>    <p>AOP has the following benefits:</p>    <ol>        <li>They maintain application modularity.</li>        <li>They separate the specifications of aspects.</li>    </ol>    <p>AOP has the following limitations:</p>    <ol>        <li>Interactions between aspects</li>        <li>They can complicate debugging. Debugging an            application that contains complex interactions            between aspects arise can be difficult.</li>    </ol></blockquote><h3>Implementation</h3><blockquote>    <p><em>What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be    aware of when implementing the mechanism? Are there    language-specific issues? </em></p>    <ol>        <li><em>Description of Bullet </em></li>    </ol></blockquote><h3>Known Uses</h3><blockquote>    <p>Xerox PARC's <a    href="http://www.parc.xerox.com/spl/projects/aop/">AOP</a>    project has built AspectJ for Java.</p></blockquote><h3>Related Mechanisms</h3><blockquote>    <p><em>What mechanisms are closely related to this one? What    are the important differences? With which other mechanisms    should this one be used?</em> </p></blockquote><hr><p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~peymano/adaptation/"><em>Backto the Adaptation home page</em></a><em>.
