Title: Very Fast Outlier Detection in Large Multidimensional Data Sets
<br>
Speaker: Amitabh Chaudhary</h2>

<p>
Abstract:
Outliers are objects that do not comply with the general behavior or
model of the data.  Applications in astronomy need fast tools for
outlier detection in data sets that have unknown distributions, are
large in size, and are in high dimensional space.  Existing algorithms
for outlier detection are too slow for such applications.  We present
an algorithm based on an innovative use of <I>k</I>-d trees that doesn't
assume any probability model and is linear in the number of objects
and in the number of dimensions.  We also provide experimental results
that show that this is indeed a practical solution to the above
problem.

This talk is based on work done jointly with
Alex Szalay and Andrew Moore.
