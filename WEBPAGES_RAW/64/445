Description:
Each line is a data sample. Each sample contains variables related to jet kinematics, tracks, vertex and high level features.
Each track contains 20 variables and each sample has a variable number of tracks.
Each vertex contains 8 variables and each sample has a variable number of vertices.
For each sample there are 14 high level variables.
Each sample has an associated weight which has to be used for sample re-weighting to balance the distributions of types samples. Two jets with weight 0.5 have the same importance in the training as a single jet with weight 1.0.

The variables can be subdivided into 3 categories; low level, medium level and high level. Each one of these is constructed strictly using information from the previous level so low level < medium level < high level.
The low level variables are the tracks + jet kinematics variables
The medium level variables are tracks + vertices + jet kinematics variables
The high level are high level features + jet kinematics variables.


Label variable:
0: Light Jet (Background)
4: Charm Jet (Background)
5: Bottom Jet (Signal)


Feature description

Each sample looks like this:
jet_pt, jet_eta, flavor, {high level track variables}, {high level vertex variables},
[{{track_variables}, {track_covariance}, {track_weight}, {vertex_variables}}, …,  }].

High level variables
The high level variables are sub-divided as  {{high_level_track_variables}, {high_level_vertex_variables}}.
Where the {high_level_tracking_variables} are:

track_2_d0_significance, track_3_d0_significance,
track_2_z0_significance, track_3_z0_significance,
n_tracks_over_d0_threshold, jet_prob, jet_width_eta, jet_width_phi

and the {high_level_vertex_variables} are:

vertex_significance, n_secondary_vertices, n_secondary_vertex_tracks,
delta_r_vertex, vertex_mass, vertex_energy_fraction

The track and vertex variables are organized as

{{track_variables}, {track_covariance}, {track_weight}, {vertex_variables}}

The track variables are given by

D0, Z0, PHI, THETA, QOVERP

Track covariance is given by:

D0D0, 
Z0D0, Z0Z0, 
PHID0, PHIZ0, PHIPHI, 
THETAD0, THETAZ0, THETAPHI, THETATHETA,
QOVERPD0, QOVERPZ0, QOVERPPHI, QOVERPTHETA, QOVERPQOVERP

The track_weight is related to how strongly the track is associated the corresponding vertex, a higher value means the track is a better fit to the vertex.

Vertex variables are taken from the vertex that the track is associated to, and can therefore be identical for several tracks. The variables are as follows:

mass, displacement, delta_eta_jet, delta_phi_jet,
displacement_significance, n_tracks, energy_fraction
