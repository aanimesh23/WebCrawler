It was known that planar graphs have O(<i>n</i>) subgraphs isomorphic
to K<sub>3</sub> or K<sub>4</sub>. That is, K<sub>3</sub> and
K<sub>4</sub> have linear subgraph multiplicity.
This paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in
the planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.
Also, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar
graphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.
<p>
More generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the
smallest number such that some complete bipartite graph K<sub>x,y</sub>
is a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear
subgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an
(x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)-connected graph (namely
K<sub>x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1,x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>) that does not
have linear subgraph multiplicity.
When x&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;3 or when x&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 and the minimal
forbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear
subgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.

Uses an idea of Baker to cover a planar graph with subgraphs
of low treewidth.  As a consequence, any fixed pattern can
be found as a subgraph in linear time; the same methods can be used to
solve other planar graph problems
including vertex connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph
isomorphism, and shortest paths.
A companion paper, "<a href="p-dtwmcgf.html">Diameter and treewidth in
minor-closed graph families</a>", presents a result announced in the
conference version of this paper,
that exactly characterizes the minor-closed graph families for which the
same techniques apply.

<i>Algorithmica</i> 27: 275&ndash;291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).
<p>
This paper introduces the <i>diameter-treewidth
property</i> (later known as <i>bounded local treewidth</i>): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an <i>apex graph</i> G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K<sub>3,a</sub>-free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
<p>Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
"<a href="p-psgi.html">subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems</a>" but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, "<a
href="//doi.org/10.1145/504794.504798">Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures</a>", <i>J. ACM</i>
48: 1184&ndash;1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, "<a href="//erikdemaine.org/papers/DiameterTreewidth_Algorithmica/">Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited</a>", <i>Algorithmica</i>
40: 211&ndash;215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of <i>bidimensionality</i>, a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,

We show how to apply reverse search to list all maximal independent sets
in bounded-degree graphs in constant time per set, in graphs from minor
closed families in linear time per set, and in sparse graphs
in subquadratic time per set.  The latter two results rely on new
data structures for maintaining a dynamic vertex set in a graph
and quickly testing whether the set dominates all other vertices.

We show that the maximum flow problem can be solved in near-linear time
for K<sub>5</sub>-minor-free and K<sub>3,3</sub>-minor-free graphs. The
same result also holds for H-minor-free graphs when H can be embedded in
the plane with one crossing and a structural decomposition of the input
flow graph is given.

<p>
For every minor-closed graph family (such as the family of planar
graphs), there is a constant c such that the maximum number of edges in
an n-vertex graph in the family is
<i>c</i>(<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>o</i>(<i>n</i>); for instance, for
planar graphs, <i>c</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3. We call <i>c</i> the limiting
density of the family, and we study the set of all limiting densities of
all minor-closed graph families. We show that this set of limiting
densities is closed and well-ordered, with order type at least
&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>, and we find an exact description of the
members of this set up to its first two cluster points 1 and&nbsp;3/2.
