<h1>   
An Overview of Techniques for Provable Data Possession
</h1>
<h2> Rishab Nithyanand, UC Irvine </h2>

<p>
Presenting a paper by Ateniese et al., from CCS 2007

<p>
Abstract: 
Provable data possession (PDP) allows a client to efficiently
verify that an untrusted server possesses some data that was
outsourced to
it by a client.

In this talk, I will present the work of Ateniese et al. (CCS 2007),
which
was the first paper in the area to formalize the PDP framework and
model.
If time permits, I will move on to talking about the more recent
paper by
Erway et al. (CCS 2009) which introduces the concept of verification
of
dynamic updates in outsourced data (Dynamic PDP).
