The ICT group in
<a target=_top href=http://www.ics.uci.edu>
ICS</a> studies the use of computer and information
technologies in real-life situations, including their organisational
and societal impact. In particular, we are interested in how computer
systems can be made to work more effectively in a range of
settings, and how they can be designed to support the needs of
individuals and groups. Topics of research include user interface
design, collaborative work,
the sociology of information, medical informatics, mobile work,
computer-mediated communication,
social informatics,
infrastructures for interaction and collaboration, and
organisational information systems design.

<p>
We carry out this work by conducting long-term ethnographic
investigations of working settings and technology use, and by
designing and developing
prototype technologies and subjecting them to both experimental and
long-term in situ evaluation.

<p>
Under its former name, CORPS, ICT
was founded in 1973, by
<a target=_top href=http://www.slis.indiana.edu/kling>Rob Kling</a>.
We have strong links to other groups on campus, including the
<a target=_top href=http://www.isr.uci.edu>Institute for Software Research</a>,
the
<a target=_top href=http://www.crito.uci.edu>
Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations</a>,
and the
<a target=_top href=http://www.gsm.uci.edu>Graduate School of Management</a>.
