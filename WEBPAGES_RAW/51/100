Click and drag to specify the initial locations and velocities of a
system of moving particles.  Each particle stops moving when it crosses
the track left by another particle.

If you were viewing this on a Java-enabled browser, you'd get to play
with my extremely exciting applet.  Since you're not, you might as well
just follow the following links, since I have no other content here:

<P>For more detailed information on this diagram,
see Jeff Erickson's page
"<A HREF="http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/open/cycles.html">crashing
motorcycles efficiently</A>".  This implementation is based on the
<A HREF="../../Methods/">FastPair</A> version of our closest pair data
structures (with nearest neighbors found by sequential search rather than
geometric range searching); see <A HREF="source/">the source code</A>
for details.
