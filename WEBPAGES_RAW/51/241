The annual California Software Symposium (CSS) brings together researchers and 
practitioners to share ideas and experiences through presentations, 
panel discussions, and debates. CSS provides a forum for both reporting 
research 
results and supporting interaction between academia and industry thereby 
providing insight into the applicability and utility of research ideas in 
commercial settings. Emphasis is on early dissemination of new ideas and
empirical evaluation and on experience with software techniques on actual 
projects. This annual event provides a unique opportunity for industry 
exposure to expertise, research, and lessons learned from a broad base of 
participants.
<p>
The California Software Symposium is the descendant of the Irvine Software
Symposium (ISS). The symposium series is now co-sponsored by IRUS and 
USC's 
<A HREF="http://sunset.usc.edu/index.html">
Center for Software Engineering (CSE)</A>. 
CSS continues in the path established the
Irvine Software Symposium and features regional, national, and
international participation.
<p> 
This one-day meeting features high quality peer reviewed papers and
presentations.  A Program Committee, consisting of IRUS and CSE faculty, IRUS
sponsors, CSE affiliates, and other regional experts, meets to review papers, 
presentations, and panel proposals, choose keynote and invited speakers, 
plan the program, and provide direction. 
<p>
A formal bound proceedings is published each year. Proceedings of previous 
CSS and ISS have been distributed around the country and beyond, providing 
excellent exposure.
