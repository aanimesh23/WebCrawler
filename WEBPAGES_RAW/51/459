Hello,

A friend of mine has sent me the rules of an interesting game,
Troll which has been created by Jean-Claude Rosa. Here are the
rules:

Troll is played with a reversi set.
There 2 players Black and White.
Each of them chooses two opposite edges on the board.
White starts.
He plays a tile facing its color on any free square of the board
exepted on corners or on opponents edges. If he wants to, he must
play an othello move which turns back opponent tiles. He must turn
back all opponent tiles catched by his move like in othello, but the
difference with othello is that it is allowed to play moves which
don't catch opponent tiles.
The winner is the first one who manages to do a path connecting his
two opposite edges. Two tiles diagonally aside are not continuous in
a path. The corners belong to all edges.

example of game :
   a b c d e f g h
  . . . . . . . . .
1 . . . .@. . . . .
2 . . . .@. . . . .
3 . .X.X.@. . . . .
4 .X.@.@.@.X.X.X. .
5 . .@.X. .@.@.X.X.
6 . . . . . .@. . .
7 . . . . . . . . .
8 . . . . . . . . .

Black to play : he can play at b2, c2, h2, e1, c7... and he plays at d5

   a b c d e f g h
  . . . . . . . . .
1 . . . .@. . . . .
2 . . . .@. . . . .
3 . .X.X.@. . . . .
4 .X.@.X.@.X.X.X. .
5 . .@.X.X.X.X.X.X.
6 . . . . . .@. . .
7 . . . . . . . . .
8 . . . . . . . . .

He has not won because there is no perpendicular link between b3 and a4.
But he is able to do a continuous path by playing a3, a5 or b6. White can
defend by playing g6 for example.
