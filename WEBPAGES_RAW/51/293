``<b>TAOS: Testing with Analysis and Oracle Support</b></A>,''
by D. J. Richardson in
<i>Proceeding of the International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (I
SSTA) </i>, Boston, June 1994.


<H2> Abstract </H2>

Few would question that software testing is a necessary activity for 
assuring software quality, yet the typical testing process is a human 
intensive activity and as such, it is unproductive, error-prone, 
and often inadequately done. Moreover, testing is seldom given a 
prominent place in software development or maintenance processes, 
nor is it an integral part of them. Major productivity and quality 
enhancements can be achieved by automating the testing process through 
tool development and use and effectively incorporating it with development 
and maintenance processes. 

The TAOS toolkit, Testing with Analysis and Oracle Support, provides 
support for the testing process. It includes tools that automate many 
tasks in the testing process, including management and persistence of 
test artifacts and the relationships between those artifacts, test
development, test execution, and test measurement. A unique aspect of 
TAOS is its support for test oracles and their use to verify behavioral 
correctness of test executions. TAOS also supports structural/dependence 
coverage by measuring the adequacy of test criteria coverage and regression 
testing by identifying tests associated or dependent upon modified software
artifacts. This is accomplished by integrating the ProDAG toolset, 
Program Dependence Analysis Graph, with TAOS. The combination of ProDAG 
and TAOS supports the use of program dependence analysis in testing, 
debugging, and maintenance. 

This paper describes the TAOS toolkit and its capabilities as well as 
testing, debugging and maintenance processes based on program dependence 
analysis. We also describe our experience with the toolkit and discuss 
our future plans.
