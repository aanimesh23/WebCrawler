<p>
I will talk about the recent paper showing better upper and lower bounds for wireless localization. In particular, for an n-sided polygon, n-2 guards is the tight bound if we require guards to be natural. For arbitrary guards, the new lower and upper bounds are, respectively, roughly 3n/5 and 4n/5. I'll present the proofs of these bounds.
