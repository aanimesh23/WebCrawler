<h5>ICS 10 • David G. Kay • UC Irvine</h5>
<h1>Seventh Homework</h1>


<p>As usual, you'll do parts of this assignment with a partner, preferably someone you haven't worked with on a prevoius assignment. Be sure to use the <a href="http://ics-10-partner-app.appspot.com">Partner App</a> so your partnership is recorded.</p>
<!--This week, again we need you to send a message to <a href="mailto:ics10@uci.edu"><code>ics10@uci.edu</code></a> with the names and UCInet IDs of both partners.</p> -->
<h4>Part (a) </h4>
<p>Read the following short articles, each on an aspect of human-computer interaction or information visualization:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/misc/caring-for-wrists.pdf">Caring for your Wrists</a>, by Adam Engst, Tonya Engst, and Jon Hersh. How to avoid debilitating wrist pain caused by computer use.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/typography.pdf">Typographic Design for Computerized Text</a>, by David G. Kay</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.asktog.com/columns/022DesignedToGiveFitts.html">A Quiz Designed to Give You Fitts,</a> by Bruce Tognazzini.  His web site, <a href="http://www.asktog.com/">asktog.com</a>, has a wide range of articles on HCI (including a <a href="http://www.asktog.com/columns/042ButterflyBallot.html">discussion of the notorious "butterfly ballot"</a> in the Florida 2000 election), but only the Fitts' Law article is required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optionally, read the article <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2001/05/28/010528fa_fact_parker?currentPage=all">Absolute Powerpoint</a> by Ian Parker, which talks about the limitations of PowerPoint as a medium of expression.</p>
<h4>Part (b) </h4>
<p>Part I of the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/10/hw/DeusXercises.pdf">Deus X homework </a>was a machine language program that identified the largest in a group of numbers.  It used register A to store the largest number the program had encountered so far—we started it at 0, then checked each number against register A and, if it was larger, we moved it into register A to replace the previously-largest value. After checking all the numbers, register A contained the largest in the group.</p>
<p><strong>(b.1) </strong> Implement the same thing in Snap. You just need one sprite with one script that starts when the green flag is clicked. The script should proceed in the same way the Deus X version proceeded, as described above. But since the Snap environment (with sprites and the stage and so on) is different from the Deus X's (with text input and output), let's specify some tips for the new environment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use &quot;ask&quot; and the associated variable &quot;answer&quot; to prompt the user to enter each number.</li>
  <li>Keep asking for numbers until the user types something that's <em>not</em> a number (there's an operator to check for that). (You could include an instruction for the user, saying something like, &quot;Enter 'done' to quit.&quot;)</li>
  <li>At the end, have the sprite &quot;say&quot; the vaue of the largest number.</li>
</ul>
Export this project into a Snap file named in the usual way: <code>hw7b1-ann17-sara20</code>.
<p><strong>(b.2)</strong> Now, what if you wanted to sort the numbers (display them in order, lowest to highest)? You can't do that just by reading each number and discarding it; you'd need to store the whole list in Snap's memory (and then run a sorting algorithm on it). Sorting is just one task that requires us to store a whole collection of values, rather than just a single value at a time; there are lots of computational tasks that require us to store a collection of values at once. In Snap, we call these collections <strong>lists</strong>; we can create a list in the Variables tab and process it as in the following example, like the one we saw in class:</p>
<p><img src="hw7images-namelist.jpg" alt="Scratch block for prompting user for list of names" width="444" height="247" /></p>
<p>Create and run this Snap script to see how it works; you can <a href="hw7-lists.xml">download a copy</a> of this script and the following one (right-click to download the file). 
<!--[<a href="hw7-lists.ypr">BYOB version</a>]-->
</p>
<p>We can <strong>traverse</strong> the list (process each item in turn) using a script like the one below. We use a variable  to point to each item in the list, one by one; we start it at 1 and increase it by 1 each time, until we've visitied every item.</p>
<p><img src="hw7images-listproc.jpg" alt="Scratch script to traverse a list (process every item)" width="337" height="153" /></p>
<p>In the downloaded Snap file, click on the clam to see this in operation.</p>
<p>We're not going to ask you to code up a sorting algorithm in Snap. Instead, modify this Snap project so that it reads a sequence of numbers (instead of names) into a list and then  displays the average of all the numbers entered instead of listing all the items. (For the first step in computing the average, start a variable called &quot;sum&quot; at zero and traverse the list, adding each item to the variable.)</p>
<p>[Side note: It's actually possible to compute the average (mean) of a sequence of numbers without storing all the numbers in a list. But to compute other things, such as the midpoint (median) or a graph showing the distribution of the numbers, you would need to store all the numbers at once. Even though we're not asking you to compute these other things, use a list in this part of the assignment.]</p>
<p>When you're done, save the project in a file named in the usual form: <code>hw7b2-ann17-sara20.ypr</code> and submit both projects (<strong>(b.1)</strong> and <strong>(b.2)</strong>) via <a href="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/">Checkmate</a>. Just one partner should submit both projects; the file names and your Email message will let us give both partners credit. 
<!--
(Include both the find-the-maximum task and the compute-the-average task in the projet you submit. You can combine them in various ways: It might be easiest to have the &quot;max&quot; sprite do its work when the user clicks it, so that task is independent from the &quot;average&quot; sprite(s). Or, you could have one sprite build the list of numbers the user enters, and then use that list of numbers both to find the maximum and find the average.)-->
</p>
<h4>Part (c) </h4>
<p><strong>(c.1) </strong>(Each partner can do this individually) Write down the five activities you do most often on your computer. You don't have to worry about precisely which one is #2 and which is #3; just list five things you do pretty frequently (e.g., read Email, shop for music, play World of Warcraft, look at Facebook, …).</p>
<p><strong>(c.2) </strong>(Each partner can do this individually, too) If you've never used an iPad before, go to the UCI Computer Store (or anywhere else where there are iPads you can use) and spend at least 15 minutes trying it out.</p>
<p><strong>(c.3) </strong>Discuss with your partner which of your common activites (your five and your partner's five) would be easier or more convenient to do on an iPad and which would be harder. For each activity (you may not have ten, if you and your partner have some in common), write down whether you think it would be easier or harder on an iPad, and (in just a few words) what it is about the iPad that leads you to that opinion. (If you and your partner don't agree, that's fine; just give each person's reasoning.)</p>
<p>Save the document containing your responses to part <strong>(c)</strong> into one document, naming it in the usual form: <code>hw7c-amyq-janet3</code>. Submit this document via <a href="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/">Checkmate</a>. Just one partner should submit one copy and the same partner should submit both parts <strong>(b)</strong> and <strong>(c)</strong>.<!--in the third-floor ICS lab, room 364 ICS: Tuesday 25 January, 11:00–noon and 1:00–2:00; Wednesday 26 January, 2:30–3:30. She will also be glad to make appointments for other times; just send mail to  <code>ics10@uci.edu</code>.  For the best chance at finding a workable time, give a few alternatives and don't wait until the end of the week.
