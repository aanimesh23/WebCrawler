Homework Assignment 3
</h1>


<p>Suppose you are given an undirected graph G.
Define a <i>layout</i> of G to be a way of
assigning distinct real-number coordinates to the vertices of G,
so that the edges of G can be represented as (open) intervals of the real 
number line.  Define the <i>bandwidth</i> of a layout
to be the maximum number of such intervals covering any point of the real 
line.  For instance, if G has vertices with coordinates 1,2,3,4, and
edges (1,3) (2,3) (3,4) and (1,4), then the bandwidth of this layout is 
three, since three of the intervals cover the value 2.5.</p>

<p>The bandwidth of G itself is defined to be the minimum bandwidth of any 
layout of G.  For instance, the layout above is not the best possible: the 
same graph has a layout with bandwidth two, so the bandwidth of G in this 
example is two.  Two layouts are equivalent (and have the same bandwidth) 
if they form the same permutation of the vertices,
so one can compute the bandwidth of G by generate and test in time O(n!).

<p>The homework problem is to devise a more efficient dynamic programming 
algorithm for computing the bandwidth of a given graph.</p>

<p>Hint:
if you choose to permute the vertices so that some subset S is placed
with smaller coordinates than everything not in S, then what is the 
optimal layout of S, and what can you say about the overall bandwidth of 
the layout?</p>
