==AREM: Aligning ChIP-seq reads by Expectation-Maximization.==


== Description ==


AREM takes the classic peak calling algorithm used in MACS 1.4 (including an empirically optimal tag shift and a locally-adjusted poissonian statistical model for tag enrichment) and adds a component for realigning ambigously mapping reads.  A probabilistic model assigns reads to regions that are more likely to be peaks (having higher enrichment).
