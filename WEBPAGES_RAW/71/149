<em><strong><font size=+1>TRUSTe: An Overview</em></strong></em><br>

<p>

TRUSTe, the Internet industry's privacy seal program, is an independent, 
non-profit agency whose mission is to build Web users' trust and 
confidence in the Internet by promoting principles of fair information 
practices.

<p>

A cornerstone of the TRUSTe program is the TRUSTe "trustmark," an online 
branded seal displayed by member Web sites. The trustmark is awarded only 
to sites that adhere to established privacy principles and agree to comply 
with ongoing TRUSTe oversight and consumer resolution procedures. A 
displayed trustmark signifies to users that the Web site will openly 
share, at a minimum, what personal information is being gathered, how it 
will be used, with whom it will be shared, who is gathering the 
information, what options the user has, what security procedures are in 
place to prevent misuse or loss and how users can correct information to 
control its dissemination.

<p>

The talk will present an overview of the TRUSTe program as well as its 
role in providing for privacy on the Internet.

<p>

<EM><strong><font size=+1>Privacy in Electronic Commerce, the W3C's P3P, and 
Upcoming Technical Challenges for Privacy Protection</em></strong></em><br>

<p>

The Platform for Privacy Preferences project (P3P) is a new protocol by 
the World Wide Web Consortium to protect users' privacy when using the 
Web and electronic commerce. Its purpose is to allow sites to present 
machine-readable and English-text privacy statements and to allow user 
agents to maintain control over private data. Several implementations 
by major companies are under development, and the protocol is about to 
be released to the public (last call).

<p>

This talk will give an overview of the P3P protocol and project. It will 
also discuss design issues in protecting privacy on the Web, user
interface and user agent issues, and the results of a recent survey 
of Internet users used to assess design considerations.

<p>

<strong>Biography:</strong>
Mark Ackerman edited and co-wrote the original architecture 
overview spec for P3P, and has participated in P3P since. He is an associate 
professor in Information and Computer Science at UC Irvine. Mark holds a 
Ph.D. from MIT as well as a MS from Ohio State and a BA from the 
University of Chicago. Prior to attending MIT, he was an R&D software 
engineer and manager, working on projects as diverse as the X Window 
System Toolkit (Xt) and the Atari Ms. Pac-Man game. He has published 
on computer-supported cooperative work, information access, virtual
