Notes from 5/11/99 Advanced Collections Teleconference

Attending: Judy Slein, Jason Crawford, Geoff Clemm, Jim Whitehead

The teleconference was shorter than normal, lasting only 20 minutes.

* Can BIND replace an existing binding?

Agreement: Yes.

Should the Overwrite header be used with BIND to control this binding
replacement capability?  Agreement: yes.  Binding replacement should
be the default.

* Discussion of integrity maintenance on bindings.  Agreement that
  bindings should have strong integrity.  There should not be any way
  to specify integrity, weak or otherwise.

Some concern by Jim Whitehead that strong integrity doesn't add much
interoperability.  Geoff Clemm feels strongly that strong integrity is
needed for interoperability.  No action taken, may be revisited when
definitions of strong integrity are complete.

* Discussion of redirect references on collections.  Jason noted that
  he too is uncomfortable with having redirect references on
  collections have "URL addition semantics", noting that there is no
  current experience with this kind of behavior.

Action items:

* Geoff volunteers to develop the semantics of bindings, including
  semantics of strong integrity.
* Jim will start thread on redirect references on collections on
  the discussion list
