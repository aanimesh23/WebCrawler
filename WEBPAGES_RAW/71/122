<h1>Glossaries</h1>


<p>
A <dfn>glossary</dfn> is
a partial dictionary, a list with explanations of technical or abstruse terms,
a collection of glosses.&nbsp;
A <dfn>gloss</dfn> is a synonym or explanation
inserted between the lines or in the margin to explain difficult words in a text
&mdash; see the beautiful example to the right (Fig. 1) dating from 1241,
in which you can clearly see glosses in the left margin,
and also in the right margin, the center gutter, and in many of the
spaces between lines.&nbsp;
A glossary collects such glosses in a single place,
rather than dispersed through a document.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
A glossary for a particular problem or domain
is a list of the special terms that are used there.&nbsp;
A glossary is a partial dictionary
in that it does not include words that are used in their ordinary senses,
only those that are either special words not used in ordinary life
or that are used with a special meaning in this context.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
See the <a href='votingGlossary.html'>voting glossary</a> for an example
of a glossary in requirements engineering.&nbsp;
This glossary defines the words and phrases
that are used with special meaning
in the domain of elections and voting.&nbsp;
Hyperlinks are used to take a reader from each use of a glossary term
to the definition of that term,
and the distinctive format of hyperlink text identifies each such use.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
A good glossary defines every word and phrase that is used with special meaning,
and gives these definitions in terms of ordinary words
and in terms of other glossary terms.&nbsp;
</p>


<h1>Ontologies</h1>

<p>
An <dfn>ontology</dfn> consists (for our purposes) of several components:&nbsp;
</p>

<ol>
  <li> a <span class='bi'>glossary</span> of concepts (as in the voting example)
  </li>
  <li> a <span class='bi'>sub-concept hierarchy</span> of those concepts
  </li>
  <li> an <span class='bi'>instance-part hierarchy</span> of those concepts
  </li>
  <li> <span class='bi'>properties</span> associated with each concept
    (an instance-property relationship).&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li> <span class='bi'>other relationships</span> between concepts
  </li>
  <li> <span class='bi'>cardinality</span> constraints on relationships,
    and <span class='bi'>functions</span> from one concept to another.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ol>

<div class='example'>
<p>
Vehicles.&nbsp;
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    concepts
    <span class='u'>vehicle</span>, <span class='u'>car</span>,
    <span class='u'>bicycle</span>,
    <span class='u'>wheel</span>, <span class='u'>engine</span>,
    <span class='u'>model year</span>,
    <span class='u'>license number</span>, <span class='u'>license plate</span>
    defined in glossary.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    Sub-concept hierarchy includes:&nbsp;
    <span class='u'>car</span> is a sub-concept of <span class='u'>vehicle</span>
    (so, every car is also by definition a vehicle).&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    Instance-part hierarchy includes:&nbsp;
    <span class='u'>car</span>s consist of <span class='u'>wheel</span>s,
    an <span class='u'>engine</span>,
    and some other things
    (so, every car has wheels and an engine).&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    Properties include:&nbsp;
    a <span class='u'>car</span> has a <span class='u'>model year</span>.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    Other relationships include:&nbsp;
    each <span class='u'>license plate</span> corresponds to a separate <span class='u'>license number</span>.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    Cardinality and functions include:&nbsp;
    every <span class='u'>bicycle</span> has exactly two <span class='u'>wheel</span>s,
    <span class='u'>car</span>s have at most one <span class='u'>license number</span>;
    given a <span class='u'>license number</span>, it is possible to determine what <span class='u'>car</span>
    (if any)
    corresponds to it.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
An ontology adds more information that is not present in a glossary.&nbsp;
This additional information provides for more informative problem descriptions.&nbsp;
It also makes it easier to check that the glossary is correct,
by giving paths by which we can try out what we have so far.&nbsp;
For example,
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    since car is a sub-concept of vehicle,
    every car must be a vehicle, and some vehicles are not cars.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    since wheels are parts of cars,
    every car has wheels, and some wheels are parts of cars.
  </li>
  <li>
    since cars have license numbers,
    some license numbers belong to cars, and some vehicles have license numbers
  </li>
  <li>
    since cars have at most one license number,
    there is no car that has two license numbers (this seems close but questionable), and there could be a car that has no license number
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Some of this additional information can be effectively presented in a diagram
(see Fig. 2).&nbsp;
A key for ontology diagrams (as we will draw them in this class)
is given in Fig. 3.&nbsp;
</p>

<div class='figure CR'>

<p>
There are several terms that seem just about interchangeable with "ontology"
in requirements engineering:&nbsp;
"conceptual map", "conceptual graph".&nbsp;
Ontologies show up in studies of databases
and have recently become common as a coming underpinning of Web pages.&nbsp;
</p>


<h2>Deciding what kind of relationship it is</h2>

<p>
Once you have decided that two concepts <i>T</i> and <i>t</i> are related,
you need to decide what kind of relationship they have.&nbsp;
One way to decide is to consider the following questions, in sequence:&nbsp;
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Is every <i>t</i> a <i>T</i>?&nbsp;
    Then <i>t</i> is a sub-concept of <i>T</i>.&nbsp;
    <p>
    (It must not be possible for any <i>t</i> not to also be a <i>T</i>.)&nbsp;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Does every <i>T</i> contain a <i>t</i> as a component part of it?&nbsp;
    Then <i>T</i> and <i>t</i> have an instance-part relationship.&nbsp;
    <p>
    (<i>T</i> and <i>t</i> must be the same sort of concept:&nbsp;
    both are physical objects, or both are mathematical concepts,
    or ....)&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
    (It must not be possible for a particular <i>t</i>
    to be part of more than one <i>T</i> at the same time;
    if it is possible, then probably a <i>t</i> is a property of a <i>T</i>
    rather than a component part.)&nbsp;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Is every <i>T</i> described by a <i>t</i> ?&nbsp;
    Then <i>t</i> is a property of <i>T</i>.&nbsp;
    <p>
    (It must not be possible for any <i>T</i>
    to not have a <i>t</i> that describes it.)&nbsp;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Are <i>T</i> and <i>t</i> related, but not in any of the ways listed above?&nbsp;
    Then <i>t</i> is just related to <i>T</i>.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Because the hierarchical <i>sub-concept</i> and <i>instance-part</i> relationships
are transitive,
you do not need to specify them
across more than one level of hierarchy;
for example, if "Toyota Prius" is a sub-concept of "Toyota",
and "Toyota" is a sub-concept of "car",
you need not also say that "Toyota Prius" is a sub-concept of "car",
because it is already implied.
Similarly, if "tire" is a part of "wheel",
and "wheel" is a part of "car",
you need not say that "tire" is a part of "car"
because this is also already implied.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
Relations are inherited down the sub-concept hierarchy,
and these do not need to be explicitly stated either.&nbsp;
For example, "car" is related to "model-year", so
you need not say that "Toyota Prius" is related to "model-year"
because this is already implied.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
<span class='scit'>Example</span>:&nbsp;
car, Toyota Prius, wheel, model year, driver, goal.&nbsp;
What kinds of relationships do these have?&nbsp;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Every Toyota Prius is a car;
    there are no Toyota Priuses that are not cars.&nbsp;
    Therefore
    "Toyota Prius" is a sub-concept of "car".&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    It is not true that every wheel is a car, or vice-versa,
    so "wheel" and "car" do not have a sub-concept relationship.&nbsp;
    However, every car has wheels as some of its component parts,
    and both cars and wheels are physical objects,
    and it is not possible for a wheel to be part of
    more than one car at the same time.&nbsp;
    Therefore
    "car" and "wheel" have an instance-part relationship,
    with "wheel" being a part of "car".&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    It is not true that every model year is a car, or vice-versa,
    so "model-year" and "car" do not have a sub-concept relationship.&nbsp;
    Nor does every car have a model year as one of its component parts,
    because "car" and "model year" are very different kinds of concepts.&nbsp;
    But every car is described by a model year,
    so "model year" is a property of "car".&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    It is not true that every driver is a car, or vice-versa,
    so "driver" and "car" do not have a sub-concept relationship.&nbsp;
    Nor does every car have a driver as one of its component parts,
    or vice-versa,
    so "driver" and "car" do not have an instance-part relationship.&nbsp;
    Nor is every car is described by specifying its driver,
    or vice versa, at least not in general
    (a particular driver may drive many cars, although not at the same time),
    so neither "driver" nor "car" is a property of the other.&nbsp;
    However, there is a relationship between a driver and a car,
    although it is none of the above kinds.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    "Car" and "goal" do not appear to have any relationship.&nbsp;
    It's not necessary to state this specifically
    (unless a reader might be confused and assume some relationship exists),
    as most concepts are assumed to be unrelated
    unless some relationship is stated.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>



<h2>Deciding what cardinality or function is appropriate, if any, for a relationship</h2>

<p>
Sub-concept relationships <b>never</b> have cardinalities or functions;
they make no sense for this kind of relationship.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
An instance-part relationship or a property relationship
has an <b>implicit</b> cardinality (at one end).&nbsp;
If a <i>t</i> is a part of a <i>T</i>,
then there is necessarily at most one <i>T</i> for every <i>t</i> already,
and this should not be also specified as a cardinality.&nbsp;
If a <i>t</i> is a property of a <i>T</i>,
then there are ordinarily many <i>T</i>s for every <i>t</i> already,
and this should not be also specified as a cardinality.&nbsp;
If the cardinality of the instances for a particular property is important,
the relationship should probably not be expressed as a property.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
An instance-part relationship
has an <b>implicit</b> function (in one direction).&nbsp;
It is always possible to figure out which <i>T</i> goes with a specific <i>t</i>
that is part of it
(it's the one that the <i>t</i> is part of)
and this should not be also specified as a function.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
Although it makes no sense to specify a function that restricts an
instance-part or property relationship,
it is possible to have one cardinality
at the part end of an instance-part relationship,
or at the property end of a property relationship.&nbsp;
A <i>T</i> may consist of <i>n</i> <i>t</i>s, for example,
or be characterized by <i>n</i> values of property <i>p</i>.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
"Other relationships" can have cardinalities at either or both ends,
and can be restricted by functions in either direction.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
<span class='scit'>Example</span>:&nbsp;
car, Toyota Prius, wheel, model year, driver, goal.&nbsp;
What kinds of cardinalities and functions do these have?&nbsp;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    "Toyota Prius" is a sub-concept of "car".&nbsp;
    Sub-concept relationships do not have cardinalities or functions.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    "Car" and "wheel" have an instance-part relationship,
    with "wheel" being a part of "car".&nbsp;
    In an instance-part relationship,
    the cardinality of the whole instance is never stated (it is implied to be 1)
    nor is the function from a part to a whole stated.&nbsp;
    It is possible to give a cardinality for the number of parts, however.&nbsp;
    In this case, we would say that each car has 4 wheels.&nbsp;
    We might also give functions to determine the four wheels for a particular car,
    calling them "right-front", "left-front", etc.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    "Model year" is a property of "car",
    and "car" and "model-year" have an instance-property relationship
    (an instance of a car has a model year as a property).&nbsp;
    The cardinality of the instance is never or rarely stated
    (it is implied to be *).&nbsp;
    Each car has exactly one model year, however, and this should be stated.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    "Driver" and "car" have a relationship
    that is none of the above kinds.&nbsp;
    It would be possible to specify cardinalities
    and/or functions if these could be determined.&nbsp;
    A driver "drives" a car, so it would probably make sense
    to specify this as a function
    (each driver can drive at most one car at a time)
    by labelling the line between the concepts;
    the cardinalities might be 0..1 drivers drive 0..1 cars
    (each driver drives either 0 or 1 car at a time,
    and each car is driven by either 0 or 1 driver at a time).&nbsp;
    An alternative relationship might be "can drive";
    for this relationship, the cardinalities might be * drivers can drive * cars
    (a driver can drive any of some unknown but potentially large number of cars,
    and vice versa).&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    "Car" and "goal" have no relationship,
    so it makes no sense to talk about cardinalities and functions for these.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Testing the correctness of an ontology</h2>

<p>
In general, one can test the correctness of an ontology by asking these questions:&nbsp;
</p>

<ol class='oi'>
  <li><b>Glossary</b>.&nbsp;
    For every term <i>T</i> in the glossary
    and term <i>U</i> used to talk about the domain:&nbsp;
    <ol class='oa'>
      <li>
        Is <i>T</i> a special term not in common use,
        or a common term that has a special meaning in this domain?&nbsp;
        (must be "yes" for every <i>T</i>)
      </li>
      <li>
        Is every word used in the definition of <i>T</i> either
        a common word used in one of its common meaning,
        or another term defined in this glossary?&nbsp;
        (must be "yes" for every <i>T</i>)
      </li>
      <li>
        Is <i>T</i> needed to discuss the domain?
        (must be "yes" for every <i>T</i>)
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        Does every <i>T</i> have the same value of <i>P</i>?&nbsp;
        (should be "no", unless <i>T</i> is a sub-concept

      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Other relationships</b>.&nbsp;

<h2>Ontology diagrams are not class diagrams</h2>

<p>
The concepts, properties, organization, relationships, and functions of an ontology
can be partially expressed in a diagram.&nbsp;
This diagram is somewhat similar to a UML class diagram, but also not similar.&nbsp;

<h2>Questions to ask about parts of an ontology</h2>

<p>
In general,
there are certain questions you can (and should) ask about parts of an ontology,
even if you don't know what the concepts mean
(as in the "Frooble" example diagram in Fig. 4).&nbsp;
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Questions about concepts ("an A")
    <ol>
      <li> What can an A do (or have, or be related to) that a non-A can't?
      </li>
      <li> What can't an A do that a non-A can?
      </li>
      <li> What can only some A's do?
      </li>
      <li> Can a non-A later become an A?&nbsp; Can an A later not be an A?
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> Questions about properties ("A is <i>P</i>")
    <ol>
      <li> If A is <i>P</i> right now, does that mean A is always <i>P</i>?
      </li>
      <li> What can A do or not do if it is <i>P</i>?
      </li>
      <li> What can A do or not do if it is not <i>P</i>?
      </li>
      <li> What other relationships can A have if it is <i>P</i>,
        that it can't have if it is not <i>P</i>?
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> Questions about sub-concept hierarchy ("An A is a B")
    <ol>
      <li> Can an A do everything a B can?&nbsp; (should be "yes")
      </li>
      <li> Are there Bs that are not As?&nbsp; (should be "yes")
      </li>
      <li> If an A is a B now, can it later still be an A but not be a B?&nbsp;
        (should be "no")
      </li>
      <li> If an A changes later so it is no longer an A,
          is it still necessarily a B anyway?
        (could be either "yes" or "no")
      </li>
      <li> Can an A change later so it is not an A?&nbsp;
          (can be either "yes" or "no")
        <i>(unlike UML class diagrams)</i>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> Questions about relationships and functions ("A is <i>R</i> with B")
    <ol>
      <li> Is every A <i>R</i> with some B?
      </li>
      <li> How many Bs is A <i>R</i> with?
      </li>
      <li> Is A always <i>R</i> with B?
      </li>
      <li> Is A necessarily <i>R</i> with itself?
      </li>
      <li> If A is <i>R</i> with B, does that mean B is <i>R</i> with A?
      </li>
      <li> If A is <i>R</i> with B, and B is <i>R</i> with C, is A <i>R</i> with C?
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
You can ask these questions about any ontology,
even if you don't know what the concepts in the ontology mean.&nbsp;
The answers help test you understanding of the relations among the concepts
