<H1>COMPUTER AIDED GEOMETRIC DESIGN</H1>
<H2>Special Issue on Medical Volume Modeling and Visualizaton</H2>

<P>High quality scientific papers that 
focus on medical modeling and visualization in three dimensions are sought 
for a special issue of  the journal
of Computer Aided Geometric Design.  
A submitted paper may be either theoretical or 
experimental; research surveys will also be considered.

<P>Typical, but not exclusive, topics include

<UL>
<LI>Algorithms of three dimensional segmentation, reconstruction,
visualization techniques for CT, MRI and PET images
<LI>Optimization of sampling strategies for volume image acquisition
<LI>Co-registration of multiple image modalities
<LI>Motion analysis and time dependent visualizations
<LI>Elastic anatomical models and deformations
<LI>Representation issues of anatomical, physiological information
</UL>

<P>The submission deadline is January 31, 1997.  Submissions should be
prepared following the standard practices of the journal and should be
sent to the guest editor, Chandrajit Bajaj, Department of Computer
Sciences, 1398 CS Building, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana
47907-1398, USA,
<A HREF="mailto:bajaj@cs.purdue.edu">bajaj@cs.purdue.edu</A> If you are
considering the submission of a paper or require additional information,
please contact the guest editor.  Electronic submission (postscript or
pdf) is acceptable.  All submissions will be refereed following the
normal practices of the journal.
