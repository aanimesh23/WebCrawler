<h1>
Cole's Parametric Search Technique Made Practical 
</h1>
<h2> Pawel Pszona</h2>

<p>
Cole's improvement to the sorting-based parametric search
technique provides an automatic way of saving a logarithmic factor in
the running time of an optimization problem over that achievable using the
standard parametric search method.
Unfortunately, this improvement comes at the expense of making an already
complicated algorithm even more complex; hence, his technique
has been mostly of theoretical interest.
In this paper, we show that the same asymptotic complexity can be achieved
in a way that is both simple and practical (i.e., suitable for actual implementation).
