				try/except Statements


In this lecture we will examine the last of the statements outlined in the the
lecture on if statements: the try_except_statement (which I sometimes refer to
as try/except). Here is a refresher of what statements were in that group,
which form the core of statements in Python. There are not many of them, but
when used together we can write scripts that solve complicated tasks.

  statement <= assignment_statement |
               import_statement     |
	       function_call	    |
	       method_call	    |
	       if_statement         |
	       for_statement	    |
	       while_statement	    |
	       break_statement	    |
	       try_except_statement |
               pass_statement              (see end of this lecture)

There are few more statements we will learn (notably return, raise, and assert),
which  are important, but are used in very specific contexts and simple to
understand (once we get into those contexts: all next week).

Exceptions (raising and handling them) is a wide and deep topic. We will take a
spiral approach to learning about exceptions, repeatedly learning more material
about exceptions throughout the quarter (and in ICS-32 and ICS-33). In this
lecture we will focus on how the try_except statement leads to simple handling
of exceptions that are raised by the Python operators or functions that we use.

The syntactic complexity of the try_except_statement (which I don't show all of
here) is large (and the semantic complexity will match): as we need to
understand more, we will learn more: the spiral approach. So, what I'm telling
you is the truth, nothing but the truth, but not the whole truth. Here is the
EBNF

  except_clause        <= except [expression]:
                              block-except

  try_except_statement <= try:
                              block-try
                          except_clause
                          {except_clause}
                          [else:
                              block-else]
                          [finally:
                              block-finally]

There is a syntax constraint that every try_except_statement: must be include
either (a) at least one except_clause or (b) a finally: block-finally (of course
both can be included). The else: block-else it totally optional. The expression
in except_clause can be omitted, but is typically just the name of a
class that represents an exception (see Section 4.5.1 for a list of exception
names defined in the builtins module: there are dozens; I have put them at the
end of this lecture as well ). Later, when we cover tuples we will learn that
expression can also be a tuple of exception names, and how the except_clause
handle such tuples then. 

Given all this syntax, the semantics is long to state but not too difficult to
understand (there is about one rule for each option/repetition in the EBNF).
Still, it will take a bit of time (and study and use, in this lecture and
beyond) to understand this language feature and become comfortable using it.
Look at the EBNF when reading these semantics; we will re-examing and illustrate
more concretely the semantics in some actual examples below.

  (1) Start executing block-try (which, by the semantics of blocks,
      sequentially executes every statement in the block).

      (1a) If no statement in block-try raises an exception, after the last
             statement is executed....

           (1a1) If the else: block-else option is included, execute block-else
                 (like else: in for/while loops, it is executed by normal
                  termination of statement (not executing break in loops, not
                  raising an exception in try/except)

           (1b2) If the finally: block-finally option is included, execute
                   block-finally

           (1b3) The try_except statement terminates

      (1b) If some statement raises an exception, abandon executing any more
             statements in the block-try (don't execute any more there)

           (1b1) If the exception is named in any except_clause, find the first
                   one that it appears in and execute its matching
                   block-except; if it appears in a later except_clause, it
                   will be ignored there.

                 If an except_clause is just except: (no expression)
    	           execute its block-except

                 (1b1a) If the finally: block-finally option is included,
	  	          execute block-finally

                 (1b1b) The try_except statement terminates
  
           (1b2) If the exception is NOT named in any except_clause
               
                 (1b2a) If the finally: block-finally option is included,
	  	          execute block-finally

                 (1b2b) The try_except statement terminates, but ....

                        Python prints a trace of the exception (showing the
                          execution history of the statements in the script)
                          and terminates the program
  
To summarize, a try tries to execute block-try; if it raises an exception,
Python handles it by executing some block-except. else: block-else, if present,
is executed only if block-try raises no exceptions; finally: block-finally, if
present, is always executed before terminating the try_except_statement.

  We are not going to learn what happens if an exception is raised when Python
  is executing statements in block-except/block-else/block-finally; well, not
  now, but we learn about this possibility later in the quarter. Typically the
  statements in these blocks are much simpler (and less prone to exceptions)
  than the statements in block-try.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Trivial Script that we can use to show all aspects of the try_except_statement

Let's start with a trivial example in a script that does nothing other than
illustrate the semantics of try/except. It would be an excellent idea to use
single-stepping with the Debug Perspective on this script to see, sequentially,
how Python executes it. Note that every possible part of a try_except_statement
appears in the example below; in most exception handling code that we write (see
the real examples later), we can omit some of this parts (e.g., maybe else:...
and/or finally: ...)

try:
    print('block-try start')
    #print(a_name_that_is_not_bound_to_anything) # raises NameError
    print('block-try stop')
except NameError:
    print('block-except')
else:
    print('block-else')
finally:
    print('block-finally')

When Python executes this script as is (with #prints...) it produces the
following results

  block-try start
  block-try stop
  block-else
  block-finally

So, both print statements in the block-try work: neither raises an exception.
There is an else: block-else option, so it is executed (only when no exception
is raised). There is a finally: block-finally option, so it is executed
(always, whether or not an exception is raised). Then, the try_except_statement
terminates.

Now, what would happen if we uncommented the line that tries to print a name
that is not bound to a value, causing Python to raise a NameError? When Python
executes that variant of the script, it produces the following results

block-try start
block-except
block-finally

So, the first print statement works, but the second raises a NameError
exception (so Python abandons execution of all later statements in block-try).
Python finds an except_clause with this exception name, and executes its block,
which is a print statement. There is a finally: block-finally option, so it is
executed (always, whether or not an exception is raised). Then, the
try_except_statement terminates.

If we had omitted the name NameError, this code would work the same: an
"except" without a name handles any exception name.

And now we try one more variant. Change the name in the except_clause to a
IndexError: a different exception (not the one raised, therefore the one raised
is not handled by this try/except). Now rerun the script (still with the print
statement raising NameError). It produces the following results.

block-try start
block-finally
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Pattis\workspace\experiment\tryexcepttest.py", line 3, in <module>
    print(a_name_that_is_not_bound_to_anything) # raises NameError
NameError: name 'a_name_that_is_not_bound_to_anything' is not defined

(actually sometimes the order of the information printed gets jumbled; don't
 worry and try to reconstuct the order of events by looking at the code).

Again, the first print statement works, but the second raises a NameError
exception (so Python abandons execution of all alter statements in block-try).
Python does not find an except_clause with this exception name. There is a 
finally: block-finally option, so it is executed (always). Then, the
try_except_statement terminates. Python prints a trace of the exception
(showing the execution history of the statements: here line 3 raised the
NameError exception) in the script and terminates the program
  
So, with this code we can test all sorts of variants of try/except. If you have
questions, try to alter this code and execute it to answer them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A real problem solved by try/except

Now let's move on to a real example of a problem that is solved by try/except.
It illustrates how the kind of code in the prompt.for_int function works. If
you look at this code in the prompt module you will likely not understand it
(because it is built with components that we haven't  learned yet) but we can
study one carefully chosen aspect of its code: how Python rejects non-integer
values.

The purpose of the code below (normally put in a function) is to prompt the
user to enter a string (using the input function available in Python, although
I prefer using the prompt.for_string function in my library); if the string
entered can't be converted to an int, then we must keep prompting the user until
he/she enters a string that represents a legal integer. Because we don't know
how many times we must prompt the user (once, twice, ...) before he/she enters
a legal integer, this is a indefinite loop, so we write a while True: loop
that contains a try/except). Here is the code, followed by an analysis of how
it works for legal and illegal inputs.

while True:
    try:
        string_rep = input('Enter int: ')
        answer = int(string_rep)	   # int(...) may raise ValueError
        break
    except ValueError:
        print('Entry error (',string_rep,') is not a legal int')

print(1 + answer) # use answer: it is guaranteed to be bound to an int object

How did I know to put ValueError in the except_clause? The first time I wrote
this code I had to find out what exception was raised when the user enters an
string that cannot be converted to an integer. Here is how I did it: I started
the Python interpreter and entered int('a') and saw it raise the ValueError
in a traceback. Here is an example of Python running the script above, where I
enter a string that can be converted to an integer.

  Enter int: 5
  6

What happens in the code above for this example: Python starts the while True:
loop and executes its block; its block is a single try/except, so it executes
the block after try. The first statement is Python's prompt to the user, and
I entered 5 (which input returns as the string '5'); the second statement calls
the int conversion function (successful for '5') which returns a reference to
an int object with the value 5, which is bound to the name answer. The third
statement is a break, which terminates the loop so Python next does the print
function call after the loop, which prints a value 1 bigger than answer. Why is
this break naked (not inside an if)? Why is it not always executed? See the
description below, for when the user enters "bad" information.

Here is an example of Python running the script, where I enter a two "bad"
strings (they cannot be converted to integers) before entering a good one.

Enter int: x
Entry error ( x ) is not a legal int
Enter int: 1,024
Entry error ( 1,024 ) is not a legal int
Enter int: 1024
1025

What happens in the code above for this example: Python starts the while True:
loop and excecutes its block; its block is a single try/except, so it executes
the block after try. The first statement is Python's prompt to the user, and
I enter x (which input returns as the string 'x'); the second statement calls
the int conversion function, but it is unsuccessful for 'x' and raises the
ValueError exception. So Python never gets to execute the break statement
because it stops executing the block-try to handle the exception. The clause
except ValueError: ... handles this exception by printing an error message. Now
the try/except is finished executing, which means the block in the while True is
finished executing, so the while loop takes control and executes its block (the
try/except) again.

Now Python executes the try/except again, so it executes the block after try.
The first statement is Python's prompt to the user, and I enter 1,024 (which
input returns as the string '1,024'); the second statement calls the int
conversion function, but it is unsuccessful for '1,024' and again raises the
ValueError exception. Again, Python never gets to the break statement. The
except ValueError: clause handles this exception by printing an error message.
Now the try/except is finished executing, which means the block in the while
True is finished executing, so the while loop executes its block (the
try/except) again.

Now Python executes the try/except again, so it executes the block after try.
The first statement is Python's prompt to the user, and I enter 1024 (which
input returns as the string '1024'); the second statement calls the int
conversion function (successful for '1024') which returns a reference to an
int object with the value 1024, which is bound to the name answer. The third
statement is a break, which terminates the loop so Python next does the print
function call after the loop, which prints a value 1 bigger than answer.

In summary the while True: loop repeatedly prompts the user as many times as
necessary. For each non-legal integer entered, calling the int(...) function
raises an exception, which causes the break statement to NOT be executed (which
keeps Python in the loop). Finally, when the int(...) does not raise an
exception, the break statement is executed and the loop terminates, and the
name answer (now referring to an integer object) can be used in later code.

Of course, you will never need to write this code in your programs because the
prompt.for_int method has code like this in it! But now you know a bit about
the magic that is inside prompt.for_int.

This is an example of a while that loops until there is no exception. The loop
(and try/except) discussed below has a different structure: its while loops
until there is an exception. We classify the first as exception continues loop
and the second as exception terminates loop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example of a for_statement translated into a while_statement

In this section we are going to get some insight into, but not a complete
understanding of, how Python translates a for_statement into a while_statement
along with a try_except_statement (and the special StopIteration exception). To
simplify this discussion and make it clearer, we are going to start by using
the simplest form of the for loop, discarding the else: block-else.

  for index in iterable:
      block-body

Python translates this for loop into the following code, which we will see
does what we know the for loop to do.

  hidden_name = iter(iterable)
  while True:
      try:
          index = next(hidden_name)
          block-body
      except StopIteration:
          break


The function iter(...) takes an iterable (so far the iterables that we have
studieds are strings, ranges/iranges, and opens -for iterating over lines in
files) and creates an object that will produce all the values, one at a time
when the next(...) function is called. The iter(...) and next(...) functions
work a bit magically (for our present understanding of them), but we will study
their details in ICS-33.

You can experiment a bit with the iter/next functions by executing the
following code

s = 'abc'
i = iter(s)
print(1,next(i))
print(2,next(i))
print(3,next(i))
print(4,next(i))

It prints
  1 a
  2 b
  3 c
and then prints the following (because next(...) raises the StopIteration
exception.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Pattis\workspace\zexperiment\test.py", line 6, in <module>
    print(4,next(i))
StopIteration

The object that we can call next on is bound to the name hidden_name (because
Python creates a special name for us that we cannot refer to); this code calls
the next(...) function on hidden_name: each time it is called, next returns the
next value in the iterable. When hidden_name has no more values to produce,
calling next on it raises a special exception named StopIteration, which the
try/except handles: its block breaks out of the while loop (so the loop is then
terminated).

For example, if itererable were 'abc' then the first time next(hidden_name)
was called it would return 'a'; the second time 'b'; the third time 'c'; the
fourth time next(hidden_name) was called it would raise the StopIteration
exception. Note this exception name does not end in Error, because it does
not really signal an error, just the end of the definite iteration. So
exceptions include more than just errors.

Study this equivalence carefully. Python executes a while True: loop, which has
a try/except statement inside (just like in the example in the previous
section), but now the break is in the except StopIteration: clause. Each
iteration of the loop binds the result produced by next(hidden_name) to index
and then executes block-body.

This rebinding/block-body execution continues until calling next(...) raises the
StopIteration exception, which is handled in the except StopIteration: clause
by executing a break statement and thus terminating the loop

Here is a concrete example, the simple for loop

for c in 'abc'
    print(c)

is translated into

hidden_name = iter('abc')
while True:
    try:
        c = next(hidden_name)
        print(c)
    except StopIteration:
        break

Copy this code into a Python module and executed it.

So the first time through the loop, next(...) returns 'a' which is bound to c
and then printed; the second time through the loop, next(...) returns 'b' which
is bound to c and then printed; the third time through the loop, next(...)
returns 'c' which is bound to c and then printed; the fourth time through the
loop next(...) raises the StopIteration exception, which is caught by the
exception StopIteration: clause, which executes a block of just one statement
-the break statement- which terminates the loop. So both loops print the three
strings 'a', 'b', 'c'.

So this while/try/except combination executes equivalently to your knowledge of
how the for loop executes.

Try executing both scripts in Eclipse and observe they always produce
equivalent results (even with ranges/iranges and opens). Use the Debug
perspective to explore how this happens. Or, try the following script, which
explains its execution with extra print statements.

hidden_name = iter('abc')
while True:
    try:
        c = next(hidden_name)
        print('next returns',c)
        print(c)
    except StopIteration:
        print('StopIteration exception raised')
        break

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two loose ends

1) Recall the EBNF for except_clause

  except_clause <= except [expression]:
                       block-except

We have discussed what it means to discard expression: in this case the except:
clause handles ALL raised exceptions (we don't have to name them). This
feature is powerful; sometimes too powerful and must be used carefully.

2) The full syntax for the for_statement is

  for index in iterable:
      block-body
  [else:
      block-else]

which Python translates to the following code

  hidden_name = iter(iterable)
  while True:
      try:
          indexes = next(hidden_name)
          block-body
      except StopIteration:
          pass		# see comment belows
          [block-else]

Python defines pass_statement <= pass (where pass is a keyword). We should add
pass_statement to the list at the top of all statements in Python. We can use
pass wherever we need a statement (in the except StopIteration: clause, we must
have at least ONE STATEMENT IN ITS BLOCK, and that statement is pass if the
else: option is discarded. Semantically the pass statement does nothing (so
technically it is Python's simplest statement). It appears above as a
placeholder to ensure the block has at least one statement.

Think about what happens, whether or not block-body executes a break: if it
does, the loop terminates before StopIteration is raised/handled, so
[block-else] is not executed (which is correct, because the loop did not
terminate normally).

In conclusion, we have now seen how to anticpate exceptions being raised and how
to use try/except to handle them. try/except won't come up much soon, but we
covered it here, along with the if/for/while/break/pass statements, because it
is one of the major statements (control structures) in Python. We will continue
to learn more about exceptions, and start using them more frequently, soon and
all the way through the end of ICS-33.

Problem:

1) Rewrite the prompt code so that if the user failed to enter an legal value
after 5 times, it would provilde some polite feedback and assume answer to be
0 (or terminate the program)? Hint: the loop should count how many times it
executes and terminate (specially) if the count reaches 5 and the user does
not successfully enter a legal value.
