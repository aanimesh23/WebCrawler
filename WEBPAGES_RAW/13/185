<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=6><B>Lab Assignment 4</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>This assignment is due at the end of lab on
Friday, October 23. </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Choose a partner for this assignment, someone
you haven&#39;t worked with already.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(a)</B>  Do exercise 11.2.2. What they're asking for is a list of <em>n</em> pairs (each pair is a <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" class="style2">posn</font> structure; each pair has the values <em>i</em> and <em>f</em>(<em>i</em>) where <em>i</em> starts at <em>n</em> and goes down by one each time until it reaches zero). Next do exercise 12.2.1 (just adapting
the program in Figure 33).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Write the function 
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">in-ascending-order?</font> as described below; you might use this in testing the results of a sorting program.
</font></P>
<pre><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">;; in-ascending-order?: list-of-numbers -> boolean
;; Return true if the list is empty or if each item <= all following items
(check-expect (in-ascending-order? empty) true)
(check-expect (in-ascending-order? (list 17)) true)
(check-expect (in-ascending-order? (list 12 14 16 18 20)) true)
(check-expect (in-ascending-order? (list 12 14 18 16 20)) false)</font></pre>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>(Hint: A one-element list is always in ascending order; consider treating that case in a separate cond clause.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Here's a question to think about:  If we want to test the correctness
of our sorting function, is it enough to have tests of
the form 
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">(check-expect (in-ascending-order? (sort L)) true)</font>?
That is, if the results of our sorting function are
sorted into ascending order, are we satisfied that our
sorting function works correctly?  (Put another way,
can we think of a way to write <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">sort</font> so that its result
always passes the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">in-ascending-order?</font> test but the 
result is not correctly sorted?)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Collect your definitions for all these exercises
into one Scheme file, make sure both partners&#39; names are in a comment
at the top, and submit it via Checkmate.</FONT></P>
<P>
  <FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(b)</B>   At this point in the assignment, change
your language level to Intermediate Student.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Copy the code for the restaurants
  program to your machine and run it to make sure it works properly in your
  environment.</FONT></P>
<P><span class="style3">After completing the task of reimplementing the collection,
  add one new feature to the program:</span> <FONT FACE="Courier New">c:
    Change prices for the dishes served</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>.
      When the user types </FONT><span class="style2">&#39;c&#39;</span><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>,
    the program should ask the user for an amount (positive or negative) representing
    a percentage change in price (so that 100 would double a price and -50 would
    cut it in half).  Then it should apply that price change to the prices for
    all the restaurants in the collection.  [Here are some hints on how to approach
    this.  Before reading further, you might want to think about how you'd do it.  You might approach
    this  byfirst writing a </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">rrant-change-price</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>
    function that takes a restaurant and a percentage change number, as above,
    and returns a restaurant that has all the same information, except that
    the price is changed appropriately.  Next you might write a function to
    apply </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">rrant-change-price</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>
    to all the restaurants in the collection.  Finally, you can incorporate
    these calls into the main program, adding the appropriate command handling
    and so on.]</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(c)</B> As we start this part of the lab, we need to explain one new feature of Scheme: the quote operator. If we type<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"> (+ 2 2)</font> in the interactions window, Scheme evaluates it by applying the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">+</font> operator to its arguments to get 4. If we type <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">&quot;(+ 2 2)&quot;</font>, scheme <em>doesn't</em> evaluate it as an arithmetic expression; the quotation marks just say to evaluate it as a string, and return the literal value <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">&quot;(+ 2 2)&quot;</font>.  Sometimes we want Scheme to evaluate what we type; sometimes we just want Scheme to treat it as data.  The way we say "don't evaluate" in Scheme is not to use double quote marks (which actually say "evaluate this as a string").  Instead, we use the quote operator, which can take the form <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">(quote x)</font> or <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">'x</font>.  This is particularly convenient if we want to indicate a constant list in our code:  We can still say <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">(list 1 2 3)</font>, but we can also say <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">(quote (1 2 3))</font> or <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">'(1 2 3)</font>.  Of course <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">(1 2 3)</font> (without the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">list</font> or <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">quote</font> or apostrophe) would give us an error, because <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">1</font> isn't the name of a defined function.  In this lab problem, you can see how we mght want to use quoted lists.</FONT></P>
<p><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>A recipe is a structure</FONT></P>
<pre><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">    (make-recipe T IL SL)</font></pre>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>where T is the title (a symbol), IL is a list
of ingredients, and SL is a list of steps.</FONT>
<P> <FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>An single ingredient is a symbol (like </FONT><span class="style1"><FONT FACE="Courier New">&#39;eggs</FONT></span><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>);
  a single step is a list of symbols (like </FONT><span class="style1"><FONT FACE="Courier New">&#39;(beat the eggs)</FONT></span><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>).  A recipe contains a list
    of ingredients and a list of steps; for example:</FONT></P>
<pre><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">(make-recipe &#39;ThaiIcedCoffee 
  &#160;&#160; &#39;(coffee sugar condensed-milk ice) 
  &#160;&#160; &#39;((brew coffee) (add sugar and condensed-milk) (pour coffee mixture over ice)))</font></pre>
<P> <FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>(Here you can see one advantage of using symbols instead of strings; with strings, we'd have to double-quote every individual word, but with symbols, we can just single-quote the whole list of them. Ask yourselves: What would be the problem with double-quoting the whole list of symbols here?)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(c.1)</B> Write the structure definition
  for a recipe, using &quot;title,&quot; &quot;ingredients,&quot; and &quot;steps&quot;
  as the names of the fields.</FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(c.2)</B> Some people say that any recipe
  can be improved by the addition of chocolate.  (Others say sesame oil, or
  Tabasco sauce.)  Write a definition of </FONT><span class="style1"><FONT FACE="Courier New">add-special-ingredient</FONT></span><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>.
    You may use an auxiliary function if you like. </FONT>
</p><pre><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">; add-special-ingredient:  list-of-recipes  symbol   -&gt;  list-of-recipes 
; Return a list containing all the recipes in the input list, but with the symbol added
;      at the beginning of the ingredients list of each recipe.</font></pre>
<P> <FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(c.3)</B> Write a definition for </FONT><span class="style1"><FONT FACE="Courier New">complete-ingredients-list</FONT></span>
.
</p><pre><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">; complete-ingredients-list:  list-of-recipes  -&gt;  list-of-symbols
; Return a list containing all the ingredients from all the recipes in the list,
;     with no duplications.  (You may assume that all the elements of a single
;     ingredients list are unique.)</font></pre>
<P> <FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>[Hint:  Define an auxiliary function called<span class="style1"> add-unique</span>.]</FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(c.4)</B> Sometimes we have to substitute
  one ingredient for another in a recipe. Write a definition for <span class="style1">replace-ingredient</span></FONT>
as described below.  Auxiliary functions are essential here.
</p><pre><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">; replace-ingredient: symbol1  symbol2  recipe  -&gt;  recipe 
; Return a recipe like the input, but with every instance of symbol1 replaced by symbol2, 
;     both in the ingredients list and in the list of steps. 
; Example: Suppose TIC is the Thai Iced Coffee recipe defined above. 
;    (replace-ingredient &#39;coffee &#39;decaf  TIC) would return 
;    (make-recipe &#39;ThaiIcedCoffee 
;      &#160; &#39;(decaf sugar condensed-milk ice)
;      &#160; &#39;((brew decaf) (add sugar and condensed-milk) (pour decaf mixture over ice)))</font></pre>
<P> <FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(c.5)</B> Some recipes are so complex that they include in their steps some references to other recipes. A cake recipe in a cookbook, for example, might have as one step, &quot;Use the chocolate icing recipe on page 23.&quot; To reflect this in our Scheme recipes, we change our definition of a &quot;list of steps&quot;:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>A list of steps (LOS) is either</FONT></P>
<ol>
  <li><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>empty;</FONT></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>(cons S LOS), where S is a single step (i.e., a list of symbols); or</FONT></li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>(cons R LOS), where R is a recipe.</FONT></li>
</ol>
<P> <FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Write a definition for <span class="style1">complete-ingredients-list2</span> that accommodates these (possibly nested) recipes.</FONT>
</p><pre><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">; complete-ingredients-list2:  list-of-recipes -&gt;  list-of-symbols 
; Return a list containing all the ingredients from all the recipes in the list, 
;     including nested recipes, with no duplications.  (You may assume that all the
;     elements of a single ingredients list are unique.)  </font></pre>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Collect these definitions and submit them via Checkmate.  Turn in what you have by the due date; then consult with the TA if you'd like to keep working.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>(d) </B>(extra credit,
according to the usual rules) Do exercises 12.4.1 and 12.4.2.</FONT></P>
