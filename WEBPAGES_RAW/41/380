<h3> Due: Wednesday, Nov 6 </h3>

<h3> Covers Sections 3.1-3.2</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Draw the arrow diagram and the matrix representation for the following relation
on the set {1, 2, 3, 4}:
R = { (1, 2), (3, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1) }.
</li>
<br/>

<li>
For each of the relations below, answer the following three questions:
<ol type="i">
<li>Is the relation reflexive, anit-reflexive or neither?</li>
<li>Is the relation symmetric, anti-symmetric or neither?</li>
<li>Is the relation transitive?</li>
</ol>
If the relation does not have one of the properties, give and example illustrating this.
<ol type="a">
<li>The domain is a set of people. (x, y) is in  the relation if person x is taller than person y.</li>
<li>The domain is a set of people. (x, y) is in  the relation if person x is a first cousin of person y (i.e.,
a parent of person x is a sibling of a parent of person y.</li>
<li>The domain is a set of UCI students. (x, y) is in  the relation if person x knows the student ID number for person y.
You can assume that every student knows his or her own student ID number.</li>
<li>The domain is the set of real numbers. (x, y) is in the relation if x + y = 0.</li>
<li>The domain is the set of real numbers. (x, y) is in the relation if x = 2y.</li>
<li>The domain is the set of real numbers. (x, y) is in the relation if x - y is a rational number.</li>
<li>The domain is the set of real numbers. (x, y) is in the relation if x &ne; y.</li>
<li>The domain is A = {a, b, c, d}. The relation is {(a,b), (a, a), (b, b), (b, a), (c, d), (d, c) }</li>
</ol>
</li>
<br/>
<li>Give an example of a relation on the set {1, 2, 3} that is neither reflexive nor anti-reflexive.</li>
<br/>
<li>Is it possible to have a relation on a set that is symmetric and anti-symmetric? If so, give an example.</li>
<br/>
<li>
Here are two relations on the set {a, b, c, d}:
<ul>
<li>S = { (a, b), (a, c), (c, d), (c, a) }</li>
<li>R = { (b, c), (c, b), (a, d), (d, b) }</li>
</ul>
Write down the set of pairs in S &omicron; R.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
Define the following relations on the set <b>R</b>:
<ul>
<li>R<sub>1</sub> = { (x, y): x &le; y }</li>
<li>R<sub>2</sub> = { (x, y): x &gt; y }</li>
<li>R<sub>3</sub> = { (x, y): x &lt; y }</li>
<li>R<sub>4</sub> = { (x, y): x = y }</li>
</ul>
Use mathematical notation to describe the following relations:
<ol type="a">
<li>R<sub>1</sub> &omicron; R<sub>2</sub></li>
<li>R<sub>4</sub> &omicron; R<sub>2</sub></li>
<li>R<sub>3</sub> &omicron; R<sub>4</sub></li>
<li>R<sub>3</sub> &omicron; R<sub>2</sub></li>

</ol>
</li>
<br/>
<li>
The diagram below shows a directed graph G:<br/>

<ol type="a">
<li>Is (a, b) in G<sup>2</sup>?</li>
<li>Is (b, e) in G<sup>3</sup>?</li>
<li>Is (g, g) in G<sup>3</sup>?</li>
<li>Is (g, g) in G<sup>4</sup>?</li>
<li>Is (b, b) in G<sup>3</sup>?</li>
<li>Is (b, d) in G<sup>5</sup>?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<br/>
<li>
Draw a picture of G<up>+</sup> for each of the digraphs below:<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<br/>
<li>
Consider a digraph G in which each vertex has in-degree at least one.
Suppose that the relation defined by the edges of G is symmetric.
Is G<sup>+</sup> reflexive? Why or why not?
</li>
