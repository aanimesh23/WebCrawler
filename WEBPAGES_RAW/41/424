  <LI> <B>Masters Comprehensive Exam</B>
    <UL>
      <LI> This course may be used as part of the Comprehensive Exam in the
          computer science masters program.  To pass the Comprehensive Exam,
          students must obtain an A<tt>-</tt> or better on the 260 Final Exam.
      <LI> Students who wish to take the Comprehensive Exam but
          are not enrolled in the course should contact me by email before
          the end of week 2 of the quarter to reserve a seat in the exam.
          Include your full name, UCI Student ID #,
          and which quarter you were previously enrolled in CompSci 260.
          Send the request from your UCI email account (to prevent identity theft).
          Students without reservations will not be permitted to sit for the exam.

  <LI> <B>Academic Dishonesty</B>
<BR>
    <UL>
      <LI> Instances of academic dishonesty will be reflected
           in the final grade (usually an F) because dishonesty devalues
           the learning experience for the whole class.
           Additional consequences may occur at the campus level.
      <LI> Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to:
          <UL>
            <LI> copying from others during an examination
            <LI> allowing another student to copy from your work
            <LI> communicating exam answers to other students during an examination
            <LI> using unauthorized materials during an examination
            <LI> tampering with an examination after it has been corrected and then returning it for more credit
          </UL>
      <LI> For more complete information about academic honesty policies,
           consult the
          <BR>

  <LI> <B>Communication</B>
       <BR>If you send me email with course-related questions:
	<UL>
	  <LI> include the string "CompSci 260" at the start of the subject line
	  <LI> include your name and UCI Student ID number in the message
	  <LI> if you are not writing from your official UCI email address,
	       please cc your official UCI email address
	</UL>
	<BR> (This protocol enables me to weed out requests for help
              on problems from non-UCI students)
