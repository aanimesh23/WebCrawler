<UL>
<LI>It is not possible to specify a sub-resource lock.  Why?
<UL>
<LI>The ability to create a sub-resource lock requires knowledge about the content type being locked.
<LI>WebDAV wanted to support all content types equally, not give preferential support to a few.
<LI>Due to the large number of content types, support for sub-resource locks would have added a lot of extra semantics to the protocol.  Some content types wouldnï¿½t have been supported.</UL></UL></UL></P>
