Here are the links Jianfeng Jia, our TA, sent me for those wanting to install
  Eclipse/G++ on their Macs.
He said:
<ol>
<li>
About the Eclipse/C++ installation, I'm using the eclipse Kepler, and installed
  the CDT as a plugin.
I think the orginal <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">CDT</a> should also
  work.
<p>
For the toolchain editor for all the lib and executions, I was using the
 "MacOSX GCC" , and for the further Linker setting, setting the corresponding
  Library path in  the "MacOSX C++ Linker". 
I don't know where does this GCC come from, it might go with CDT, or get
  installed by the previous Xcode (by 
  <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-apple-mac-os-x-install-gcc-compiler/">this</a>) ?)
<p>
All the other setting is the same as your instructions. 
<li>
About the courselib, they may see the problem like this:
 <b>dyld: Library not loaded</b>
They need to export the <b>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> environment variable to the
  absolute path of courselib/Debug/. 
I found one <a href="http://gordienoye.ca/words/?p=10">blog</a> mentioned to
  set it inside eclipse: Property -> Run/Debug Settings , choose project name,
  click "edit",  choose "Environment" tab -> click "new" to add such variable.
