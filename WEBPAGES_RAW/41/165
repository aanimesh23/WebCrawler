Richard H. Lathrop, Ph.D., is a professor in the
<a href="http://www.cs.uci.edu/">
Computer Science Department (ICS)</a>
of the
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">
Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS)</a>
at the
<a href="http://www.uci.edu/">
University of California, Irvine (UCI).</a>
He received his Ph.D. in 1990 from the
<a href="http://www.mit.edu/">
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</a>
in
Artificial Intelligence (AI), and afterwards was first a post-doc and then
a research scientist at the
<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/">
MIT AI Lab.</a>
He also holds graduate degrees in electrical engineering
and in computer science from
<a href="http://www.mit.edu/">
MIT,</a>
and an undergraduate degree in mathematics from
<a href="http://www.reed.edu/">
Reed College.</a>

</p><br><p>

Dr. Lathrop's research for the last 15 years has involved applying
intelligent systems and advanced computation to problems in molecular
biology.  He has broad interests in computational molecular biology,
including current research interests in protein structure prediction
from sequence, protein-DNA interactions and genetic regulation,
rational drug design and discovery, and other molecular
structure/function relationships.  He also has broad interests in
intelligent systems, especially machine learning, constraint systems,
and optimal heuristic search.  Recently he has begun to explore DNA
self-assembly, with applications to nanotechnology and biotechnology.
