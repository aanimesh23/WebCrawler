We will cover the entity relationship (E/R) approach to database design. We will cover the relational data model, mapping E/R designs to relations, relational design theory, abstract query language such as relational algebra, and programming in SQL. Students will get exposure to how relational database management systems are used to implement a database. Time permitting, we will also consider advanced database management features such as object-oriented and object-relational database systems. This course is aimed at database design and use of database management systems in implementing database applications.</p><h3 id="CS122B"><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs122b/">CS122B: Projects in Database Management and Web Applications</a></h3><span> - </span><a xmlns="" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~chenli/">Prof. Li</a><p>This course exposes students to advanced programming concepts and
provides students with a greater focus on using DBMS techniques to
build Web-based applications. It is intended for two purposes: (1) It
introduces students to the modern data management techniques including
database connectivity, Web application development, extending database
functions, database administration, and XML. (2) It teaches students
how to use these technologies to build real-world applications. The
course builds on  CS122A, which introduces students to the classical
relational databases and SQL programming.

Multimedia is becoming the common mode of synchronous, asynchronous, local, and remote communication. Most of the current assisted communication technologies use single medium. Adoption of multimedia has significant social implications. More relevant to this course, it has significant opportunity for technology development.

Multimedia computing and communication systems started receiving attention more than a decade ago. Naturally, early systems dealt with very limited aspect of multimedia. With progress in technology, we will have to address several computing and communication issues in dealing with creation, communication, storage, access, and presentation of multimedia. In this course, we will discuss fundamentals of multimedia systems and address emerging issues that are being addressed as well as should be addressed. In discussing topics, our emphasis will be on concepts and fundamentals.</p><h3 id="CS222"><a href="www.ics.uci.edu/~cs222/">CS222: Principles of Database Management</a></h3><span> - </span><a xmlns="" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mjcarey/">Prof. Carey / <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~chenli/">Prof. Li</a></a><p>This course provides an implementor's view of database management systems. It covers fundamental principles and implementation techniques, issues, and trade-offs related to database management systems. Topics covered include storage management, buffer management, record-oriented file systems, access methods, query optimization, and query processing,. This course is a must for those students wishing to explore database management as an area of research and/or who plan on taking CS223 or CS224. A significant portion of database systems research as well as industrial database and information system development deals with adapting the basic database techniques covered in this course to new advances in hardware and software technologies or to the requirements of different applications and data types.</p><h3 id="CS223"><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs223/">CS223: Transaction Processing and Distributed Data Management</a></h3><span> - </span> <a xmlns="" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sharad/">Prof. Mehrotra</a><p>The course covers fundamental principles underlying transaction processing including database consistency, concurrency control, database recovery and fault-tolerance. The course includes transaction processing in centralized, distributed, parallel, and client-server environments. It also covers distributed database systems. The course is a prerequisite for further advanced data management courses and research principles of data management.</p><h3 id="CS224"><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs224/">CS224: Advances in Database Management System Technology </a></h3><span> - </span><a xmlns="" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sharad/">Prof. Mehrotra</a><p>This course covers selected topics in advanced database research.
