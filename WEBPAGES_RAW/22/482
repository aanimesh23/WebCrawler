<H1><A NAME="SECTION0036100000000000000000">
33.1 Atoms, Bond, Conformers, and Molecules</A>
</H1>

<P>
The most important data types in the OEChem library are OEMolBase,
OEAtomBase and OEBondBase. These three classes describe the behaviors of
molecules, atoms and bonds respectively.  However, these types are
``abstract'' classes, describing the methods and semantics of molecules,
atoms and bonds, but without defining an actual implementation.  Several
implementations of OEMolBase are defined by the OEChem library including
OESCMol (Single Conformer Molecule) for simple molecule processing, OETMol
(Traversal Molecule) for fast looping, and OEDBMol (Database Molecule)
for minimal memory usage.
Additional OEMolBase implementations may also be provided by the user,
which can then be used by many of the functions in the OEChem Library.

<P>
An OEMCMolBase is a multi-conformer extension of an OEMolBase.  The
OEMCMolBase inherits from a OEMolBase and also contains OEConfBases, which
are additional sets of coordinates to represent conformers or depictions.
There may soon be multiple implementations of an OEMCMolBase, but
currently the only implementation is the OEMCMol, which holds a
3-dimensional Cartesian representation of the coordinates.  The underlying
OEMCMolBaseT implementation is templatized on the coordinate representation,
and is currently implemented with both float and double coordinates (although
float coordinates are the default).

<P>
An OEMolBase representing a molecule can be thought of as containing a
(possibly empty) set of atoms represented by OEAtomBases, and a
(possibly empty) set of bonds represented by OEBondBases.  Each
OEAtomBase and OEBondBase belongs to a single OEMolBase, its parent.
It is not possible for an OEAtomBase or an OEBondBase to be
simultaneously part of two distinct molecules.  Similarly, an OEMCMolBase,
which inherits from an OEMolBase may contain atoms and bonds.  In addition,
is can contain a (possibly empty) set of conformers represented by
OEConfBases.  Each OEConfBase belongs to a single parent.  The OEAtomBases,
OEBondBases, and OEConfBases currently implemented cannot be created
outside of the context of a parent molecule.

<P>
An OEBondBase (typically) represents a covalent/dative bond between two
OEAtomBases.

<P>
OEMolBase, OEAtomBase, OEBondBase, OEMCMolBases, and OEConfBases are all
themselves derived from a more primitive class OEBase.  The methods of the
OEBase class allow arbitrary data to be associated with an object, using a
tag- value pair mechanism.  Thus for simple extensions of molecules, atoms,
or bonds, one can simply use this arbitrary data method to associate
additional data with the classes, rather than needing to derive or wrap a
new molecule, atom, or bond class.

<P>
Since all of the classes discussed so far are abstract (<I>e.g.</I> - they
define
only an interface), they cannot be explicitly instantiated by a user, rather
they can only be associated with pointers or references to objects.  For
users who desire detailed control of their own memory, this is a
convenience, however for ease of use we have designed some concrete wrapper
classes.  These classes are the OEGraphMol,OEQMol and OEMol, which correspond to
the OEMolBase and OEMCMolBase respectively.  OEGraphMols and OEMols can be
declared by users and should be the primary molecules used in most
high-level OEChem code.  Any OEChem function which is defined for
OEMolBases is also defined for OEGraphMols, and an OEGraphMol can be
passed to any function which takes an OEMolBase argument.  Similarly OEMols
have the same API as OEMCMolBases and can be passed to any function which
takes and OEMCMolBase or OEMolBase.  Above we spoke of several different
implementations of OEMolBases.  The different implementations of
OEMolBases.  The different implementations can be obtained by using an
unsigned int argument in the OEGraphMol, OEQMol, and OEMol constructors.
Finally, these concrete classes act as smart pointers around the
implementations of the abstract classes, so there is no need for a user to
clean up memory used by these versions of the molecules.

<P>
For efficiency, function parameters should never specify the concrete
classes.  Instead, they should always be declared using the corresponding
abstract-base classes.  For instance, rather than:

<P>
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">void fcn(const OEGraphMol &amp;mol)
{
  ...
}
</pre></dl>

<P>
one should use:
<dl><dd><pre class="verbatim">void fcn(const OEMolBase &amp;mol)
{
 ...
}
</pre></dl>

<P>
Either of these functions call be called with either an instance of an
OEGraphMol or a reference to an OEMolBase, however, the latter may be more
efficient.

<P>
Since OEAtomBases, OEBondBases, and OEConfBases can only be accessed
through their parent molecules, there is no need for concrete instances of
these classes.  In OEChem, these three classes are accessed via pointers to
the respective base classes, or through the iterator interface discussed
elsewhere.
