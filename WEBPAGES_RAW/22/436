<h2>Projects in CORPS</h2>
These are a sample of current projects going on in CORPS.

<h4>Cooperation Awareness and Privacy</h4>
<p>
The aim of the project is to help people who collaborate with each
other electronically and who possibly work in different locations and
time zones negotiate a policy for disseminating group awareness
information that balances the demand for such information with
individual privacy preferences. The ultimate result is likely to be a
software tool that recognizes conflicts between demands for group
awareness information and for privacy, and helps group members
negotiate a compromise.

<h4>Privacy as a Design Requirement</h4>
<p>
Privacy demands of Internet users as well as international (and future
national) privacy legislation have an impact on the collection of
personal data in web-based systems. This project studies specifically
the impacts on "personalized" web-based systems, which cater their
interaction to each individual user, collect considerable amounts of
personal data for this purpose, and "lay them in stock" for possible
future adaptation. This project analyzes and documents these privacy
requirements.

<h4>Success Factors of Information Visualization Systems</h4>
<p>
Research in information visualization aims at leveraging human
perceptual abilities for data analysis, by presenting information not
as numbers and text but in visual form. Effective visual displays must
therefore be designed in such a way that users can easily obtain an
overview of the data, spot outliers, patterns and correlations, and
see the changes that will occur if some parameters become
altered. Visualizations need to make such significant facts salient
for human perception. This identifies "success factors" of
visualization systems for multivariate data, by conducting experiments
both with analysts working individually on a computer screen, and with
groups of analysts collaborating in front of a large-sized display.

<h4>Software Visualization</h4>
<p>
Software systems are large, complex artifacts over which many people
work. The effectiveness of cooperation between developers depends on
their understandings of the structure and operation of the code base,
and the activities of their colleages. However, conventional software
tools don't focus explicitly on these problems of software
understanding. We're exploring the use of visual properties to explain
both the static and the dynamic properties of large software systems.

<h4>Security and Usability</h4>
<p>
In many systems, security and usability seem to be opposite design
concerns; making systems more secure seems to make them less
usable. However, usability is critically important for security,
because a system is only as secure as the way that it's used, and the
way that it's used depends on how users understand and approach
it. Based on studies of how people manage security in software systems
as an everyday, practical problem, we're developing new models that
will help people understand security concerns in the systems that they use.

<h4>Fluid Information Spaces</h4>
Conventional information systems force people to organize their
information according to fixed structures such as hierarchies and
database schemas. By contrast, in everyday activity, the ways that
people work with information are much more fluid. Information
organization emerges from how people interact with information, rather
than being predefined, and different people have different ways of
organizing the same information.
<p>
We are looking at ways to build information systems that provide
better support for informal information management for personal, group
and organizational work. This includes both information
infrastructures based on attribute storage models, and novel
interaction approaches such as spatial hypertext.

<h4>Expertise Recommendation</h4>
Expertise networks are technical augmentations of the ad-hoc social
networks that enable people to answer questions, accomplish tasks, and
find information. Technologies to create, enhance, and maintain these
networks will be important uses of the Net. We have been conducting
studies into expertise seeking in technical organizations, and
developing prototype technologies that reflect our findings.

<h4>Organizational Memory</h4>
Information technology has enabled organizations to generate and
retain mountains of information. Unfortunately, many organizations
suffer from "infoglut." They have the information they need, but they
don't know they have it. Or, knowing they have it, they can't find
it. From the perspective of the organization, one method of managing its
intellectual resources is to attempt to augment its organizational
memory. If an organization learns, then the result should be
available later. 
<p>
A standard connotation of organizational memory, that that can
captured in a written record, is only one form of organizational
memory. The most obvious places include information repositories such
as corporate manuals, databases, filing systems, and even
stories. Additionally, individuals are a prime location for retention
of the organization's knowledge. However, organizational memory can be
retained in many other places, including organizational culture,
processes, and structures. 
Thus, information technology can support organizational memory in two
ways, either by making recorded knowledge retrievable or by making
individuals with knowledge accessible. Our work has been concerned
with both possibilities.

<h4>Information Needs in Health Care</h4>
We focus on collaborative information seeking in health care
organizations. 
Our goal is to understand the roles that technology and organizational 
norms play in helping determine when and how information is sought and
used 
by groups and individuals. We closely examine the relationship between
the 
information seeking methods of the various health-care workers and 
technologies such as the computer-based patient record. The findings
from 
our fieldwork will be used to design systems that support
collaborative 
information seeking by patient care teams.
