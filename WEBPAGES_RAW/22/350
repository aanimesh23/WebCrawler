<h1>
Finding small patterns in permutations in linear time
</h1>
<h2>

</h2>
<p>
Given two permutations σ and π, the Permutation Pattern problem asks
if σ is a subpattern of π. We show that the problem can be solved in
time 2^O(ℓ^2 log ℓ)⋅n, where ℓ=|σ| and n=|π|. In other words, the
problem is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the size of the
subpattern to be found.
</p>

<p>
We introduce a novel type of decompositions for permutations and a
corresponding width measure. We present a linear-time algorithm that
either finds σ as a subpattern of π, or finds a decomposition of π
whose width is bounded by a function of |σ|. Then we show how to solve
the Permutation Pattern problem in linear time if a bounded-width
decomposition is given in the input.
