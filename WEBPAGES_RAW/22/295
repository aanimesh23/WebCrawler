<h1>
Fixed parameter tractability of crossing minimization of almost-trees
</h1>
<h2>
Michael Bannister
</h2>

<p>

We investigate exact crossing minimization for graphs 
that differ from trees by a small number of additional edges, 
for several variants of the crossing minimization problem. 
In particular, we provide fixed parameter tractable algorithms for 
the 1-page book crossing number, the 2-page book crossing number, 
and the minimum number of crossed edges in 1-page and 2-page book drawings.

This is joint work with David Eppstein and Joe Simons.
