<h1>
Parallel External Memory Model
</h1>

<h2>Nodari Sitchinava, UCI</h2>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
I will talk about a new model of parallel computation which is
designed with multicore architectures in mind. The model takes into
explicit consideration the cache-oriented nature of inputs and
outputs in modern CPUs. I will present a parallel sorting algorithm
which is provably optimal in both running time and cache-miss rate.
<p>
This is joint work with Michael Goodrich and Michael Nelson.
