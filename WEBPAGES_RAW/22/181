Cache-Adaptive Algorithms
</h1>
<h2>
Jenny Lam
</h2>

<p>
We introduce the cache-adaptive model, which generalizes the
external-memory model to apply to environments in which the amount of
memory available to an algorithm can fluctuate. The cache-adaptive model
applies to operating systems, databases, and other systems where the
allocation of memory to processes changes over time. We prove that if an
optimal cache-oblivious algorithm has a particular recursive structure,
then it is also an optimal cache-adaptive algorithm. Cache-oblivious
algorithms having this form include Floyd&ndash;Warshall all pairs
shortest paths, naive recursive matrix multiplication, matrix transpose,
and Gaussian elimination. While the cache-oblivious sorting algorithm
Lazy Funnel Sort does not have this recursive structure, we prove that
it is nonetheless optimally cache-adaptive. We also establish that if a
cache-oblivious algorithm is optimal on &ldquo;square&rdquo;
(well-behaved) memory profiles then, given resource augmentation it is
optimal on all memory profiles.
</p>
<p>
We give paging algorithms for the case where the cache size changes
dynamically. We prove that LRU with 4-memory and 4-speed augmentation is
competitive with optimal. Moreover, Belady's algorithm remains optimal
even when the cache size changes. Cache-obliviousness is distinct from
cache-adaptivity. We exhibit a cache-oblivious algorithm that is not
cache- adaptive and a cache-adaptive algorithm for a problem having no
optimal cache-oblivious solution.
