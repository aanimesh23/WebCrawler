	I am a graduate from the University of California, Irvine with a PhD degree from the <a href="http://www.networkedsystems.uci.edu/"> Networked Systems Program</a>. I am affiliated with the UC Irvine <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu"> School of Information and Computer Science </a> and  UC Irvine <a href="http://www.its.uci.edu"> Institute of Transportation Studies</a>.
	I am co-advised by Professor <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/faculty/profiles/view_faculty.php?ucinetid=aregan"> Amelia Regan </a> and Professor <a href="http://www.its.uci.edu/~wjin/"> Wen-Long Jin</a>.		  
	As an engineer, my industry experiences include <a href="http://www.cisco.com"> Cisco Systems <a/> and <a href="http://www.qualcomm.com"> Qualcomm </a>.  I also did internships during college years in start-up companies, <a href="http://www.anydata.com"> Anydata <a/> and <a href="http://www.endeavors.com/"> Endeavors Technology</a>.

      <ul>
      My broad research interests are in the general field of computer networks with a focus on building routing protocols and network architectures that improve the reliability, security, and performance of future communication systems.        
      Currently, I am interested in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET).  VANET has the potential to be an important enhancer for <a href="http://www.its.dot.gov/index.htm"> Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)</a>. Future ITS can lead to significant impact on people&#39;s lives and society with lasting effects on safety, economy, and the environment.
      My primary research in VANET include network architecture and design with focus on addressing the reliability and security aspects.  The subject of my PhD dissertation is to leverage and incorporate understanding of traffic flow dynamics to improve broadcast communication and network security in VANET.
