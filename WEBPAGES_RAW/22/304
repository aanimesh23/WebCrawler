Weaving a Web of Trust</a></strong></em></strong><br>

Rohit Khare, <a href="http://www.uci.edu">UC Irvine</a>, <a href="mailto:rohit@uci.edu">rohit@uci.edu</a>, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rohit">www.ics.uci.edu/~rohit</a></font>

<p>

As once-proprietary mission-specific information systems migrate onto 
the Web, traditional security analysis cannot sufficiently protect each 
subsystem atomically. The Web encourages open, decentralized systems 
that span multiple administrative domains. Trust Management is an emerging 
framework for decentralizing security decisions that helps developers and 
others in asking "why" trust is granted rather than immediately focusing 
on "how" cryptography can enforce it. This talk introduces the fundamental 
principles, principals, and policies of Trust Management, as well as Web-
specific pragmatic issues. [This work was originally presented in the 
World Wide Web Journal, First Monday, and the National Research Council 
Computer Science and Telecommunication Board's Information Systems
Trustworthiness committee. See <a href="http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~adam/papers/
trust.html">http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~adam/papers/trust.html</a>]

<strong>Biography:</strong>
Rohit Khare joined the Ph.D. program in computer science at 
the University of California, Irvine in Fall 1997, after serving as a 
member of the MCI Internet Architecture staff. He was previously on the 
technical staff of the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT, where he focused 
on security and electronic commerce issues. He has been involved in the 
development of cryptographic software tools and Web-related standards 
development. Rohit received a B.S. in Engineering and Applied Science 
and in Economics from the California Institute of Technology in 1995.

<EM><strong><font size=+1>Validating the Net: an Internet-scale Certificate Validation Service</em></strong></em><br>

<p>

ValiCert's universal approach addresses potentially debilitating 
performance and compatibility problems related to certificate validation. 
A key component of the ValiCert solution is its high performance 
Certificate Revocation Tree (CRT) technology, which allows validation 
of digital certificates without downloading the entire global revocation 
list. This approach scales easily to accommodate hundreds of billions of 
certificates without creating an undue burden on the client requesting 
validation information. The result: vastly improved performance compared 
to earlier mechanisms, such as Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

<p>

<strong>Biography:</strong>
Ambarish Malpani is ValiCert's first employee and joined the 
company with over ten years of industry experience as a systems designer 
and architect. Most recently, Ambarish was a consultant specializing in 
cryptography and Internet applications. Ambarish holds an M.S. degree 
from the University of California at Santa Barbara and a B.S. degree from 
the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
