<h1>CompSci 163/265, Spring 2016, Homework 8</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Find an actor for whom the <a href="https://oracleofbacon.org/">Oracle of Bacon</a> (with its default settings) returns a path that connects that actor to Kevin Bacon but has more than four hops.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the clustering coefficients of each of the five graphs of the Platonic solids (the tetrahedron, cube, regular octahedron, regular dodecahedron, and regular icosahedron).</p></li>
<li><p>(163 students:) Prove that, in any graph, the maximum clique size is at most one plus the degeneracy. (Hint: find a subgraph in which all vertices have degree at least the clique size minus one.)</p>
<p>(265 students:) Prove that the degeneracy of a chordal graph always equals one less than the size of its maximum clique.</p></li>
<li><p>(163 students:) A complete graph is a graph in which every two vertices are adjacent. When the Bron&ndash;Kerbosch algorithm (with pivoting) is run on a 4-vertex complete graph, how many recursive calls does it make in total? When the algorithm without pivoting is run on a 4-vertex complete graph, how many recursive calls does it make in total?</p>
<p>(265 students:) Give formulas for the number of recursive calls made by the Bron&ndash;Kerbosch algorithm on an $n$-vertex complete graph, with and without pivoting, as a function of $n$. (Suggestion: try it on small graphs first to find the pattern, and then verify that the pattern you find is correct.)</p></li>
