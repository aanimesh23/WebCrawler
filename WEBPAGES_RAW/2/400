<H1>Parking Information and Directions to the <br>
UC Irvine University Club<br>
using an <i>IRUS Parking Permit</i></H1>

If this is your first visit to the UCI campus, you should be aware that
it is not easy to figure out the campus. We recommend that you get a 
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/directions/directions_uci.html">
map</a>
with building numbers.
 
<p>
The University Club (UClub) has its own parking lot (18B). 
You do not need a permit to park in this lot. However, this lot
is small and fills up quickly. In addition, you can only park there for
the duration of the meeting. If you have other plans on campus, you will
have to move your car (they <b> will</b> ticket).
 
<p>
To be safe, you should bring an IRUS permit with you in case lot 18B is
full or you need to stay on campus after the meeting.

Plan to arrive at least 30 minutes early to ensure you get a parking
space, and to walk to the University Club.

<b>From North</b><br>
 
(Alternate directions from North included below.)
 
<p>
These directions take you to the new entrance to UCI. This is the
quickest route. <br>
<p>
 
<blockquote>
Take the 405 South to the 73 South. <br> <br>
Take the Bison exit - the <i>last</i> exit before the toll road begins.<br> <br>
Go left onto Bison. <br> <br>
Go through the lighted intersection, into UCI. <br> <br>
Go right at the next lighted intersection (East/West Peltason Dr.).
<br> <br>
At the first stop sign (Los Trancos Rd.), make a left into lot 18/18A. 
 <br> <br>
The UClub (yellow brick, building #32) and UClub parking lot (18B) 
will be on your 
immediate left. No permit is needed in the UClub parking lot.
 <br> <br>
If lot 18B is full, use your IRUS permit to park in lot 18/18A.
You can park anywhere there is a red AR sign,
or in any unmarked space (but not in the space with the white VIP sign,
metered spaces, or service spaces).
 <br> <br>
If lots 18/18A and 18B are full, you can use your IRUS parking permit 
to park in lot 18C. To get to lot 18C, exit lot 18/18A and go left onto East
Peltason. Go left at the next stop sign (Gabrielino Rd.) into lot
18C.  As you enter, use the portion of the lot on the left.
