<H1>ICS 180: Strategy and board game programming</H1></A>

<H2>Course Project</H2>

Since the goal of the course is to learn how to write a computer game
program, the primary coursework will consist of a project in which teams
of students write such a program.  Project teams should consist of 3 or
4 students.  Each project is expected to go through the following
milestones (described in more detail on the pages linked to each topic):

<TABLE>
<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD>7 Jan:</TD>
    <TD>Form project teams</TD>
    </TR>
<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD>14 Jan:</TD>
    <TD><A HREF="proposal.html">Submit a proposal</A> describing the
	game to be programmed,
	detailing the features of game positions to be used
	in evaluating game positions,
        and listing the tasks assigned to each of the team members</TD>
    </TR>
<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD>21 Jan:</TD>
    <TD>I will review the proposals and return them to you. Start coding!</TD>
    </TR>
<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD>4 Feb:</TD>
    <TD>Complete work on the user interface, board representation, and
    move generation modules of your program.  These modules should link
    together to form a program
    that acts as a game board for human-human play.</TD>
<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD>25 Feb:</TD>
    <TD>Target date for producing a working program, leaving the rest of
    the quarter for testing, evaluation function improvement, and the
    addition of more sophisticated search algorithms.</TD>
    </TR>
<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD>11 Mar:</TD>
    <TD>Turn in your final projects along with written reports
    describing the project status.</TD>
    </TR>
<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD>Finals week:</TD>
    <TD>Project demonstrations</TD>
    </TR>
