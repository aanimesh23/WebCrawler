	Reference Variables in Linked List Processing/Special Linked Lists


Introduction (mostly Special Linked Lists):

In this lecture we will first examine the use of references and pointers to
pointers to learn alternative ways to write some linked list processing code.
Then we will examine some standard variations to simple linear-linked lists:
circular, header, trailer, and doubly-linked lists. We will discuss the
tradeoffs between using these lists and simple linear-linked lists. Standard
linear-linked lists are used more often than any of these variants, but it is
interesting to see what tradeoffs the variants allow: Programming Assignment #2
(and some later programming assignments) will involve these variants.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

References and Pointers to Pointers

Recall that if a parameter is passed by reference, the parameter aliases the
storage location of the argument. We will draw pictures of aliased arguments by
having a line (not an arrow, arrows are for pointers) lead from the parameter
to the argument (the parameter will not have its own box, it will just show the
arrowless line connecting it to the box it aliases). In the code, whenever we
examine/change a reference parameter we are really examining/changing the
argument passed to it. The parameter is bound automatically to the address of
the argument and examined/stored by automatic dereferencing the address.

Note that we often see "const T&" as the mode/type of a parameter: that
provides a fast way to do the equivalent of parameter mode/type "T": access an
argument of type T and do not change it: for large chunks of data & is faster
because it passes the address of T; it doesn't copy all the values in T (but
the const ensures the reference is not used to change T or any part of T). So
this mode is fast and safe. For passing "small" types (like int), both take the
same amount of time, but accessing a value through an address (indirectly) is a
bit slower. So, there are efficiency tradeoffs.

We can use references to simplify code for the functions that change linked
lists (e.g., adding/removing values): by writing void functions that do not have
to return a value. Here are the standard void add_front, add_rear, and
remove_lookahead functions, where the pointer to the begining of the linked
list is passed by reference (and not const). We read the mode/type
specification right to left: "LN<T>*& l" means "l is a reference to a pointer
to an LN object instantiated with values of type T".

In all these cases, we call these functions like: add_front(x,some_value); they
do not return a result but instead change either x's state (by the reference
mode parameter) or the state of some LN in the linked list x points to. The
only changes to the code from the original functions that we studied are that
the parameter l may be changed (meaning the argument matching l may be changed),
and that no value is returned.

template<class T>
void add_front(LN<T>*& l, const T& value) {
  l = new LN<T>(value,l);
}

template<class T>
void add_rear(LN<T>*& l, cont T& value) {
  if (l == nullptr)
    l = new LN<T>(value); //Default argument for 2nd parameter is nullptr
  else {
    for (LN<T>* p = l; /*see body for termination*/; p = p->next)
      if (p->next == nullptr) {
        p->next = new LN<T>(value);
        break;
      }
  }
}

template<class T>
void remove_lookahead (LN<T>*& l, const T& to_remove) {
  if (l == nullptr)
    return;

  if(l->value == to_remove) {
    LN<T>* to_delete = l;
    l = l->next;
    delete to_delete;
  }else{
    for (LN<T>* p = l; p->next != nullptr; p = p->next)
      if (p->next->value == to_remove) {
        LN<T>* to_delete = p->next;
        p->next = p->next->next;
        delete to_delete;
        break;
      }
  }
}

Examine the first picture accompanying this lecture note. It illustrates how
add_rear(x,...); works when x is nullptr (on the left) and when x points to a
linked list (on the right). Again, do some hand simulations to better
understand how the reference parameter l is used in the code, following the
rules and graphics for reference parameters.

Finally, we can get some leverage from using pointers to pointers in our code,
although the complexity and extra execution overhead can be high. The following
function removes a value from a list. It uses p to point to a pointer and uses
a small amount of (complicated) code to remove the first LN containing
to_remove from the list.

In a call remove_ptp(x,5) it starts with p pointing to the storage occupied by
the variable x. Here is the first example of a pointer that does NOT point to
an object, but instead points to a storage location that points to an object:
p will first point to x's storage, and then p will point to the storage of next
instance variables in the LN (list node) objects in the linked list.

In this code, p traverses the linked list until p points to a storage location
(the "x" variable or the "next" instance variable in some LN object) such that
(*p)->value equals to_remove: in this case the code updates the variable p
points to; it stores a pointer to the LN beyond the first one storing to_remove.

By using a pointer to a pointer we don't need to use either lookahead or ghost
pointers, but the extra indirection of p pointing to a variable containing a
pointer makes the code complicated to understand and less efficient to execute.

You should still try hand simulating it using pictures, but I consider
understanding this code a bit beyond what is required for this course.

template<class T>
void remove_ptp (LN<T>*& l, T to_remove) {
  for (LN<T>** p =&l; (*p) != nullptr; p = &((*p)->next))
    if ((*p)->value == to_remove) {
      LN<T>* to_delete = *p;
      (*p) = (*p)->next;
      delete to_delete;
      break;
    }
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Circular Linked Lists:

A circular linked list is a linked list whose rear LN points to its front LN
(so nullptr does not mark the end of the list). It becomes a bit arbitrary to
speak of a front and rear when these LN nodes are arranged in a circle. A
circular list may be empty, but if there are LN nodes, none of them have a next
instance variable storing nullptr. See the pictures of simple circular linked
lists. The one LN version is especially interesting because its next instance
variable points to itself (since its single node is both its front and rear).

Here is code to print a circular linked listing by printing the first node,
the second, ...., the last, and then literally "..." to show the nodes continue
in a circle.

template<class T>

void print(LN<T>* cl) {
  if (cl == nullptr) {
     std::cout << "nullptr";
     return;
  }

  std::cout << cl->value;
  for (LN<T>* p = cl->next; p != cl; p = p->next)
    std::cout << "->" << p->value;
  std::cout << "..."

There are a few applications for circular lists. One allows us to represent
and efficiently process a queue by having a single pointer to the "rear"
value in the queue (instead of one to the front and one to the rear). Note that
in a circular list, the node one beyond the rear is the front, so both the
front and rear nodes in a queue are easily reached from the rear node: all
"action" in a queue is at the front (remove) or rear (add). If we pointed to the
front node, there could be an arbitrary number of nodes between it and the rear
node, so it would take lots of time to reach the rear node from the front; but
it takes only one operation to reach the front node from the rear. So it isn't
intuitive, but pointing to the rear node is the right node to point to.

If rear points to the last node an a queue represented by a circular list,
here is code to add to the rear of the queue (enqueue). Draw a picture of an
empty list, a circular list with one node, and a circular list with 3-5 nodes
and simulate this code on those lists to see that it is correct.

  if (rear != nullptr)
    rear = rear->next = new LN<int>(some_value,rear->next);//rear->next is front
  else
    rear = new LN(some_value);       //Make it a 1 node circular list, pointing
    rear->next = rear;               //  to itself; cannot do in 1 statement
  }
    
If rear points to the last node in a queue represented by a circular list,
here is code to remove the front of the queue. Draw a picture of an empty
list, a circular list with one node, and a circular list with 3-5 nodes and
simulate this code on those lists to see that it is correct.

  if (rear != nullptr) {
    int front_value = rear->next->value;  //Front is after rear (even if same)
    if (rear->next == rear)               //Just 1 node in the list?
      rear = nullptr; 			  //Yes, make empty list
    else
      rear->next = rear->next->next;      //No,  rear->next refers to new front
  }   		   			  //     the one current after front 

For simplicity, this code does not delete the removed LN.

If we had to represent a huge number of queues, most of which are empty,
using a class that stored one pointer to the rear of a circular linked list
will save space when compared to using a class that stores two pointers to the
front and rear of a linear-linked list.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Header Linked Lists:

A header linked list is a linked list that always contains a special header
node; an empty header list contains just this one node. The header node stores
no data (in its value); this node exists solely to simplify code that processes
linked lists by ensuring that every "real" node in the linked list is preceded
(is pointed to) by some node. This guarantee allows us to never have to change
what front points to (it always refers to the header) and therefore we do not
need any special-case code to handle this (now impossible) option, or reference
parameters, or pointers to pointers (the other ways to simplify this code).

For example, I wrote the following code for adding a value v to the rear of a
linked list (which also caches a pointer to the rear LN)

    if (front == nullptr)
       front = rear = new LN<int>(v);
    else
       rear = rear->next = new LN<int>(v);

If the linked list were a header list, an empty list would have a front and
rear: would both point to the header node (whose ->next is set to nullptr in the
constructor). We could simplify the codeabove to the following single line of
code (because front would never store a nullptr)

    rear = rear->next = new LN<int>(e);

In a header list, one never changes front: it always refers to the header.
So every "real" node that we manipulate in the list is guaranteed to have a
previous node pointing to it (via its next instance variable). This guarantee
often simplifies the code for adding and removing nodes (see the example above),
although some other operations (like traversal) might be more complicated,
because we must remember to skip the header node. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trailer Linked Lists:

A trailer linked list is a linked list that always contains a special trailer
node; an empty trailer list contains just this one node. As with a header node,
this node stores no data in its value; this node exists solely to simplify
code that processes linked lists by ensuring that every "real" node in the
linked list is followed by a node. In "trailer lists", every list has a special
(valueless) trailer node at the end. So, an "emtpy trailer list" would have one
list node in it. All "real" nodes in the list come before the trailer. By using
a trailer node, we can remove a node that we have a pointer to, without
needing a pointer to the node before it!

I'll show this "trick" in class; hand simulate the following code again to see
how it works (do it with p pointing to the first, last and middle node in a
trailer list). Note that the "last" node IN a trailer list is the one before
the trailer node. This code works correctly only if the node p points to is
always followed by another node (which is guaranteed for a trailer list; and p
-the node to be removed- must never point to the trailer itself).

    LN<T>* to_delete = p->next;
    p->value = to_delete->value;
    p->next  = to_delete->next;
    delete to_delete;

in fact, in C++ we can collapse the inner two statements into
   *p = *to_delete;

The statement *p = *to_delete copies both the instance variables in the LN
to_delete points to into the LN p points to.

Sometimes it is useful to combine header and trailer nodes into one list,
allowing all simple methods (both those simple for header lists and those
simple for trailer list) to be written simply. The next picture illustrates an
empty header/trailer list and one containing three int values.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Doubly-Linked Lists:

A doubly-linked list is a non-linear linked list: it contains pointers both to
the node that comes before (prev) and after (next) it in the linked list. We
would define such a doubly-linked node (DLN) as

template<class T>
class DLN {
  public:
    LN ()
      : prev(nullptr), next(nullptr){}
    LN (const DLN<T>& dln)
      : value(dln.value), prev(dln.prev), next(dln.next){}
    LN (T v, DLN<T>*p = nullptr, DLN<T>* n = nullptr)
      : value(v), prev(p), next(n){}

    T       value;
    DLN<T>* prev;
    DLN<T>* next;
};

Given this definition, we can traverse a doubly-linked list in either direction:
we can reach any node from any other node. The cost for this flexibility is an
increase in the space needed to store a doubly-linked list: twice as many
pointers in each node (2 instead of 1) and the requirement to change twice as
many pointers when we mutate the list, e.g., when adding/removing values in
nodes.

For example, when we add a node to a doubly-linked list, we need to make
the next variable of the one before it refer to the new node, and the prev
variable of the one after it refer to the new node. And in the new node itself,
we need to set its prev variable as well as its next instance variable.

The following method illustrates how to remove a node from a doubly-linked list.
Assume DLN<T>* node_to_remove;
  
    if (node_to_remove->prev == nullptr) // or (front == node_to_remove)
       front = node_to_remove->next;
     else
       node_to_remove->prev->next = node_to_remove->next;

     if (node_to_remove->next != nullptr)
       node_to_remove->next->prev = node_to_remove->prev;

If the node added is at the front or rear of a doubly-linked list, there are
all sorts of special cases to handle. By having both a header and a trailer
node in a doubly-linked list, we can simplify this code and remove all the
special cases. For example, in a doubly-linked lists with header and trailer
nodes, we can simplify the remove code above to

     node_to_remove->prev->next = node_to_remove->next;
     node_to_remove->next->prev = node_to_remove->prev;

But now, even an empty list has two nodes: the header and trailer, linked to
each other.

Note that node_to_remove->prev with a header node will never be nullptr, and
likewise node_to_remove->next with a trailer node will never be nullptr. But, to
create an empty doubly-linked header/trailer list requires the following code:

  front = new DLN<int>()
  front->next = new DLN<int>();
  front->next->prev = front;

which is a bit convoluted.


The overhead and extra complexity of these special linked lists make them more
cumbersome to use than simple linear linked lists, but sometimes we require
their extra functionality.

Probably trailer lists are the most practical of all these special lists, and
we will use them in some part of out programming assignments.
