<H1>Geometric Graph Coloring Problems</H1>

These problems have been extracted from "Graph Coloring Problems", T.
Jensen and B. Toft, Wiley 1995.  See that book (specifically chapter 9,
on geometric and combinatorial graphs) or its
<A HREF="http://www.imada.ou.dk/Research/graphcol.html">online
archives</A> for more information about them.

<P><LI><B>Hadwiger-Nelson Problem</B>.  Let G be the infinite graph with
all points of the plane as vertices and having xy as an edge if and only
if the points x and y have distance 1.  What is the chromatic number of G?
It is known to be at least four and at most seven.

<P><LI><B>Ringel's Circle Problem</B>.  Let C be a set of circles in the plane.
The circles may be of different sizes, and they may overlap; however, no
three circles in C can have a common tangent.  Let G be the graph with
vertices C and edges C<sub>i</sub>C<sub>j</sub> for circles
C<sub>i</sub> and C<sub>j</sub> having a common tangent.
Is there an upper bound on the chromatic number of G?
If so, it must be at least five.

<P><LI><B>Sachs' Unit-Sphere Problem</B>.  Let M be a set of unit spheres
in R<sup>n</sup> such that no two have interior points in common.
Let G be a graph with vertex set M and edges xy whenever spheres x and y
touch.  What is the maximum chromatic number for these graphs?

<P><LI><B>Sphere Colorings</B>.  The chromatic number
X(S<sub>r</sub>) of a sphere of
radius r in R<sup>3</sup> is the minimum number of colors possible in a
coloring
of the points of the sphere in which any two points at unit (chordal)
distance apart are colored differently.
Is X(S<sub>r</sub>)=4 for all r &gt; 1/2?  More generally,
in dimension n,
is X(S<sub>r</sub>)=n+1 for all n <U>&gt;</U> 3 and all r &gt; 1/2?

<P><LI><B>Graphs of Large Distances</B>.  Let S be a finite set of
points in R<sup>d</sup>, let d<sub>k</sub> be the kth largest distance formed
by pairs of points in S, and let G(s,k) be the graph with vertex set S
having an edge xy for all x and y in S such that the distance between x
and y is at least d<sub>k</sub>.  How large can X(G(S,k)) be as a
function of d and k?  What about when S is in convex position?
