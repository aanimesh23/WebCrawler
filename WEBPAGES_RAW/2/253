<P><FONT  SIZE=4>You will edit your assignments in groups of
    two or three.  It doesn&#39;t matter whether you work with the same people
    you worked with last time.  Take a couple of minutes to identify each other.
    We will help form groups if necessary. <BR>
  As you read and comment on each other&#39;s papers, keep in mind the purpose
    and audience of the paper (that is, to convince decision-makers to support
    the proposed changes). <BR>
  On the editor&#39;s written comments, the editor should be sure to write
  &quot;Edited by&quot; and his or her name.  Each author must turn in the
  editor&#39;s written comments along with the revised version of the paper. </FONT></P>
<OL TYPE="I">
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Before reading the paper, talk to the author
and get clear answers to the questions below; then answer the same questions
for the person editing <I>your</I> paper.</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Who is the intended audience?  Corporate executives,
project managers, technical people?  Who actually makes decisions about
changing this product?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>How much does the audience understand about
the software already?  Have they used it?  Do they know what its advantages
and shortcomings are?  In other words, what background does the author <I>assume</I>
(and thus not have to address explicitly in the proposal)?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the author expect the audience to be
receptive to the proposal, neutral, or hostile towards it?  What does the
author estimate the chances are of approval?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
</OL>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Read your classmate&#39;s paper once through
without making any comments.  Then, write down briefly your first impressions:</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Do mechanical errors get in the way of reading
it?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Is it well organized and easy to follow?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Does it do the job?  If you were the decision-maker,
would you spend money on this proposal (given that you have many other good
things to spend the money on)?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
</OL>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Read it again, more carefully, making comments
in the margins.  Focus your comments on the organization and content; don&#39;t
spend much time proofreading for spelling or grammatical errors (which the
author should have cleaned up already).</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Write down brief answers to these questions:</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<OL TYPE="A">
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the author give the decision-makers the
right level of information?  Is too much (or to little) assumed?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>How is the paper organized?  Can you draw
a clear outline or flowchart?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the opening paragraph make the reader
want to read more?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Do the paragraphs follow one another to build
a convincing argument?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Is there any place where a concept is mentioned
that isn&#39;t explained until later in the document?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the closing paragraph summarize the reasons
for making the change?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
</OL>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the author make a convincing case?  What
else would help persuade the decision-maker?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
</OL>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Review the author&#39;s slides, making written
comments on these issues:</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Content and Organization</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Do the slides &quot;walk the reader through&quot;
the main points of the proposal? Are there major points of the proposal
that are not reflected in the slides? Do they seem to be paced well through
the whole presentation?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Is each slide adequately identified, for example
with a title, so that its place in the presentation is clear?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>If a slide uses bullet points, is parallelism
observed?</FONT></LI>
<BR>

<FONT  SIZE=4>Is the wording crisp, clear, and concise?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
</OL>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Design</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Are the slides too crowded or too sparse?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Are they easy to read at a glance, from a
distance?  (Is there too much text?  Are the graphics too small?)</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Does every pixel pay its way?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the color, if used, convey better information
than monochrome or gray-scale?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>If a background pattern is used, does it interfere
with reading the foreground?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>If there are graphics or screen shots, do
they help make the point effectively?  Can the back row of the audience
read the important parts of these illustrations?</FONT></LI>
<BR>
<LI>
<FONT  SIZE=4>If the author plans to use live, computer-based
slides, does the &quot;live-ness&quot; add something that makes it worthwhile
to use the technology?  (&quot;Dissolves&quot; or &quot;wipes&quot; between
otherwise static slides don&#39;t really justify taking the time and trouble.)</FONT></LI>
