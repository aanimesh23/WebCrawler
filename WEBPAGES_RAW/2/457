<P><B>Minor source release update.</B>
<I>(3:00 PM PST)</I></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A small change was made to the Chimera 2.0b1 source release. This
update removes an unnecessary call to load the Chimera home-page on
server start-up when what it was supposed to do was load the server's
HTML documentation. The Chimera jar file has been updated as well.
The updates are available, as always, from the

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A very simple wrapper for the Solaris version of Netscape Navigator has
been released. This wrapper should be considered alpha software due to
the lack of documentation. Send questions about the wrapper to
<A HREF="mailto:kanderso@ics.uci.edu">Ken Anderson</A>. Download the
client from the <A HREF="software/index.html">software</A> page.</P>

<P><B>Slight modification to Chimera source and class releases.</B>
<I>(1:15 PM PST)</I>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <A HREF="software/index.html">software</A> page has been updated with new
releases of the chimera2b1.jar file and the chimera source releases. The
change to the jar file was to create it without compression. The size of the
jar file has increased 400k but it should now be possible to put it in a
CLASSPATH for direct use by all 1.1.x Java Virtual Machines. The source
release had four files that were located in the wrong directory. This caused
use errors when the source release was compiled in such a manner as to
place the .class files in the same directory as the cooresponding .java
files.</P>
