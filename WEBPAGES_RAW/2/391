Penrose Tiles
</H2>
Penrose was not the first to discover <A HREF="tiling.html">aperiodic
tilings</A>, but his is probably the most well-known.
In its simplest form, it consists of 36- and 72-degree rhombi,
with "matching rules" forcing the rhombi to line up
against each other only in certain patterns.  It can also be formed
by tiles in the shape of "kites" and "darts" or even by deformed
chickens (see the "perplexing poultry" entry below).
Part of the interest in this tiling stems from the fact
that it has a five-fold <A HREF="sym.html">symmetry</A> impossible in
periodic crystals, and has been used to explain the structure of certain
"quasicrystal" substances.

Mark Bickford asks if this tiling is always three-colorable.
<A HREF="http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arc99/5_15_99/mathland.htm">Ivars
Peterson reports on a new proof</A> by Tom Sibley and Stan Wagon
that the rhomb version of the tiling is 3-colorable;
A proof of 3-colorability for kites and darts
was recently published by Robert Babilon 
[Discrete Mathematics 235(1-3):137-143, May 2001].
This is closely related to my page on <A HREF="lacolor/">line
arrangement coloring</A>, since every Penrose tiling is dual to
a "multigrid", which is just an arrangement of lines in parallel families.
But my page only deals with finite arrangements, while Penrose tilings are
infinite.
