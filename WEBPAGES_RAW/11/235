                <p><strong>Gene Tsudik</strong> and <strong>Ersin Uzun</strong>
 (PhD Candidate, Netsys Program) have been awarded a Google Research
                   Award for $50,000 for a research effort entitled "Secure and Usable Group Association of Personal Wireless Devices."</p>
                <p>The goal of this research is to come up, and 
experiment with, scalable, and usable techniques for spontaneous 
*secure*
                   association among a group of wireless devices and 
gadgets. The group device association problem arises whenever a set of
                   individuals, each "armed" with a personal wireless 
device, want to set up a common secure communication channel for the 
purpose
                   of a short-term meeting or a longer-term 
collaboration. It also figures prominently in emergency response and law
 enforcement
                   settings. </p>
                <p>This project dovetails from a larger NSF-funded 
project (jointly with Professor <strong>Alfred Kobsa</strong>) on secure
 and
                   usable association of wireless devices. </p>
                <p>Tsudik's research interests are mainly in 
computer/network security, privacy and applied cryptography. His recent 
work focuses on
                   privacy in Internet services, RFID systems and mobile
 ad hoc networks, as well as security in sensor networks and storage 
systems.
                   His research also covers secure group communication, 
in particular, group key agreement, group signatures and group access 
control. </p>

                   recognized with the 2009 Premier Award for SimSE, a 
game-based educational software engineering simulation environment that
                   allows students to practice "virtual" software 
engineering processes in a graphical, interactive and fun setting.</p>
                <p>SimSE's direct, graphical feedback enables students 
to learn the complex cause and effect relationships underlying software
                   engineering processes. During the game, the student 
takes on the role of the project manager and directs engineers to 
perform
                   typical process tasks. </p>
                <p>SimSE helps bridge the gap between the conceptual 
knowledge about software engineering that is presented in lecture but 
that
                   often times is not fully explored or practiced in 
assignments or projects. </p>
                <p>SimSE includes a customizable modeling environment 
that allows instructors to create new scenarios, application domains,
                   organizations and cultures. SimSE has been used 
worldwide and has been found to be an educationally effective tool that
                   increases students' understanding of software 
engineering process concepts. </p>

             <p>A paper entitled, "Markerless View-Independent 
Registration of Multiple Distorted Projectors on Extruded Surfaces
                Using an Uncalibrated Camera" by Computer Science 
professor <strong>Aditi Majumder</strong> and graduate student
                <strong>Behzad Sajadi</strong> has won the runner up in 
the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Visualization 2009 conference
                held in Atlantic City this month. </p>
             <p>The paper presents the first algorithm to geometrically 
register multiple projectors in a view-independent manner on a
                common type of curved surface, vertically extruded 
surface, using an uncalibrated camera without attaching any
                obtrusive markers to the display screen. This simple 
markerless registration has the potential to have a large impact
                on easy set-up and maintenance of large curved 
multi-projector displays, common for visualization, edutainment,
                training and simulation applications. </p>
             <p>IEEE Visualization is the premier annual forum for 
visualization advances for academia, government, and industry.
                This event brings together researchers and practitioners
 with a shared interest in visualization tools, techniques, and
                technology. </p>
             <p>Majumder's research addresses how to produce a seamless 
image on a large-scale tiled display - an important problem to
                both the scientific and entertainment fields.  She has 
developed a suite of mathematical models, methods and software
                to correct the geometric and color variations that arise
 when tiling multiple projection displays. </p>

                and Assistant Professors <strong>Deva Ramanan</strong> 
and <strong>Charless Fowlkes</strong> received the Marr Prize at
                the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 
held the first week of October in Kyoto, Japan. </p>
             <p>The prize is awarded to the best paper at ICCV and is 
considered one of the top honors in computer vision.  The award is
                named after David Marr, a theoretical neuroscientist who
 made profound contributions to the theory of both human and machine
                vision in the 1970's. </p>
             <p>The paper describes research on a new approach to 
modeling contextual relations between objects in an image (e.g. bottles
                are often seen resting on top of tables but not the 
other way around). The system automatcially learns these relations from
                example images and uses this information to outperform 
existing approaches to object detection. </p>
             <p>Fowlkes' research is in computational vision, both in 
understanding the information processing capabilities of the human
                visual system and in developing machine vision systems. 
He is also interested in applying computer vision techniques to
                automating the analysis of biological data and 
developing algorithmic tools for understanding morphology and spatial 
aspects
                of gene expression. </p>
             <p>Ramanan's research interests span computer vision, 
machine learning, and computer graphics. His past work focused on the
                analysis of human movement from video, including 
tracking people and recognizing their actions.  Current interests 
include
                object recognition, large-scale image/video processing, 
structured-prediction approaches to learning, and activity recognition. </p>

             <p><strong>Michael Franz</strong>, Professor of Computer 
Science, has received a $600,000  grant from the National Science 
Foundation's CyberTrust program. His project with co-PI Cormac Flanagan 
from UC Santa Cruz will investigate next-generation infrastructure for 
trustworthy web applications.</p>
             <p>Many services traditionally performed by stand-alone 
programs running on desktop computers are being migrated to "Web 2.0" 
applications, remote services that reside "in the cloud" and are that 
accessed through a browser.  This migration process offers a unique 
opportunity to re-engineer the way that software is constructed, adding 
some extra capabilities that reduce the vulnerability of the global 
information infrastructure to problems such as viruses, cyber-attacks, 
loss of privacy, and integrity violations.</p>
             <p>With this goal in mind, this project designs and 
implements a next-generation infrastructure for trustworthy web 
applications. It evolves the existing Web 2.0 technologies into a more 
trustworthy "Web 2.Sec" version by introducing information-labeling and 
strong information-flow controls pervasively at the service provider, at
 the user's end, and on all paths in between.</p>
             <p>A key feature of the new Web 2.Sec architecture is that 
all application programs are executed on top of a virtual machine (VM) 
rather than directly on physical hardware. Hence the VM retains full 
control over the data at all times, allowing it to enforce 
information-&#254;ow policies that guarantee con&#222;dentiality and integrity. 
Even a malicious or faulty program running on top of the Web 2.Sec VM 
cannot cause any action that would violate these policies.</p>
             <p>Franz is an expert on virtual machines, mobile-code 
security, and dynamic compilation. He is the co-inventor (with a 
graduate student) of the Trace Compilation method that now drives 
JavaScript performance in Mozilla's Firefox browser. He has graduated 13
 Ph.D. students, been awarded more than $7 Million in competitive 
Federal research funding as Principal Investigator, and has published

 Usable Location Privacy in Geo-Social Networks.</p>
             <p>The project will explore the usability, feasibility, and
 scalability of preserving privacy and securing location-aware 
geo-social networking platforms on mobile devices, such as Google 
Latitude. The research group is basing their project on a belief that

</div>
<p>Professor of Computer Science Scott Jordan has received a $500,000 National Science Foundation grant to incorporate telecommunications policy and economics into the Internet architecture. </p>
<p>&#8220;As a result of technical, economic and public policy forces, the Internet's original design principles &#8211; layering and end-to-end &#8211; are increasingly violated,&#8221; says Jordan. </p>
<p>Currently, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are deploying quality of service mechanisms, but only allowing their use for certain applications sold to their own subscribers. Some ISPs have used deep packet inspection techniques to implement traffic management practices that throttle or block peer-to-peer applications. </p>
<p>Professor Jordan hopes to counteract this deterioration by proposing an interdisciplinary approach that updates the Internet architectural principles to account for telecommunications policy and economics. </p>
<p>The project will identify the flaws of the end-to-end and layering models that are not withstanding the technical, economic, and legal forces upon networking.  The project aims to modify these models so that they promote good technical design, respond appropriately to economic pressures, and encourage societally beneficial outcomes. </p>
<p>To validate these new models, Professor Jordan plans to illustrate their potential use by applying them to three case studies &#8211; net neutrality, traffic management, and Quality of Service.</p>
<p>Professor Jordan is also developing an undergraduate course on &#8220;The Internet and Public Policy&#8221;. This research will help bridge the gulf that exists between communication lawmakers and networking researchers by informing staff members in the United States Congress about the technical aspects of telecommunication issues, and by developing an architectural framework for the networking research community to help them consider impacts of network economics and law.</p>
<p>Professor Jordan&#8217;s research interests currently include pricing and differentiated services in the Internet, resource allocation in wireless multimedia networks, and telecommunications policy.</p>

<p>Computer Science Professors <strong>Nikil Dutt</strong>, <strong>Alexandru Nicolau</strong>, and <strong>Alexander Veidenbaum</strong> have been recognized with a Best Paper Award at the 2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN). </p>
<p>An interdisciplinary collaboration, the paper entitled &#8220;Efficient Simulation of Large-Scale Spiking Neural Networks Using CUDA Graphics Processors&#8221; was also co-authored by Computer Science Ph.D. students Jayram Moornikara and Assistant Professor of Cognitive Science Jeffrey Krichmar.</p>
<p>The paper describes new techniques for parallelization of spiking neural network models of the brain and their efficient realization on emerging graphics processor platforms. This will enable close-to-real-time simulation of realistic networks of nerve cells and could have many practical applications.</p>
<p>IJCNN is the premier international conference in the area of neural networks theory, analysis and applications.</p>
<p>Dutt is a Chancellor&#8217;s Professor whose research interests lie in the area of embedded systems and computer-aided design, with a specific focus on the exploration, evaluation and design of domain-specific embedded systems spanning both software and hardware. Other projects within his group include low-power/low-energy compilation and synthesis, validation and verification of embedded systems, software/hardware interfaces for distributed embedded systems, memory architecture exploration for embedded systems, and brain-inspired architectures and computing.</p>
<p>Nicolau's work is in the design and implementations of a system of program transformations that support the semi-automatic (and eventually fully-automatic) exploitation of substantially all the parallelism available in a given program. Nicolau is also interested in developing a tool for the rigorous study and development of parallelizing compilers.</p>
<p>Veidenbaum's research is in the areas of computer architecture, embedded systems, and compilers. He investigates new ways to build faster processors and systems and to reduce their power consumption and cost.</p>

                   Tomlinson</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Bill Tomlinson</strong>, professor of informatics, has been awarded a $280,371 Early-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) for his project which will utilize narrative-centered computing (NCC) to allow children to see how their own behavior can cause positive or negative changes in a story ecosystem.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional computational storytelling that utilizes a linear &#8220;filmstrip&#8221;, NCC framework begins with a new mechanism for computational storytelling called spatiotemporal anchoring. Spatiotemporally anchored stories consist of a network of story nodes in which each node depicts a small element of the overall plot, and is anchored to a specific location in space and time. </p>
<p>To advance the story users explore a rich geographical representation of the relevant spatiotemporal locale, discovering story nodes and the interconnections between them. Because nodes can be anchored at variable levels of spatiotemporal resolution and interlinked in non-linear ways, exploring these narratives will help children to develop more nuanced abilities for reasoning about distributed causation and variable scale. These abilities, in turn, will translate into more effective engagement with environmental issues.</p>
<p>The EAGER program is intended to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches, therefore the grant will go toward funding the creation of a testbed interactive narrative, to be deployed online and as a temporary science museum exhibit. This narrative will use spatiotemporal anchoring along with video and traditional cinematographic techniques to dramatize the interactions that take place within a representative California ecosystem, for example, a marine environment in which sea otters, kelp forests, and sea urchins all interact. </p>
<p>Tomlinson's research deals with the social impacts of information technologies, in particular regarding environmental issues and interactive education systems. His previous contributions to informatics and computer science are significant in human-computer interaction, interactive animation, autonomous agents, and multi-device systems.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Bill Tomlinson</strong>, Professor of Informatics, along with Professors Brett Sanders and Robin Keller have received a $38,000 grant from
                   the Environment Institute at UC Irvine to support a new project entitled &#8220;Using IT to Compress Perceived Time and Space in How People Think About
                   Global Change: A Step Towards Behavioral Change&#8221;. </p>
<p>This interdisciplinary research collaboration is also being supported in part from a $10,000 contribution from the Urban Water Research Center at
                   UC Irvine.  Sanders and Keller are respectively professors at The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and The Paul Merage School of Business. </p>
<p>The research collaboration will study the difficulties people have in engaging with environmental issues, in part because global change occurs on
                   scales of time and space that are relatively large compared to the usual scope of human decision making.   People respond enthusiastically to
                   fast-acting disasters such as fires and earthquakes, but less so to issues that occur more gradually over many years, even when the consequences
                   are far greater. </p>
<p>To date, there has been little research on how to connect long-term global environmental change to human scales of time and space in a systematic
                   way, thereby enabling behavioral change.  Tomlinson et al&#8217;s research will focus on the science and public perception of sea level rise. </p>
<p>Tomlinson's research deals with the social impacts of information technologies, in particular regarding environmental issues and interactive
                   education systems. His previous contributions to informatics and computer science are significant in human-computer interaction, interactive

<p><strong><a name="olson_collaboration_2009"></a>Olson gives keynote talks on Scientific Collaboration and Science Collaboratories</strong></p>

</div>
<p><strong>Gary Olson</strong>, Bren Professor of Information and Computer Sciences will give two keynote talks at the University of Siegen in
                   Germany, and the 2009 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Olson gave a keynote entitled "Scientific Collaboration on the Internet", at the conference on Enhancing Humanities:
                   Potentials of Media and ICT in the Humanities, held at the University of Siegen in Germany. </p>
<p>In 1989 a small group of pioneering thinkers, led by Joshua Lederberg and William Wulf, sketched out a vision of what has come to be known by
                   various names, such as collaboratories, eScience, and cyberscience. </p>
<p>In the several decades since then many such projects have emerged in almost all areas of science.  But there has been a complex pattern of
                   success and failure in such efforts.  Olson and his colleagues have spent nearly a decade studying these projects, trying to figure out what
                   accounts for the pattern of success and failure in them. In his talk he reviewed lessons learned, and where he hopes to go with further research
                   in the area. </p>
<p>The current understanding from this investigation was recently summarized in a book entitled "Scientific Collaboration on the Internet" (MIT
                   Press, 2008). </p>
<p>This week in Baltimore, Olson will give a keynote entited "The Next Generation of Science Collaboratories". Olson will also talk about how the
                   changing technical scene opens new opportunities for the next generation of collaboratories, as well as the sociotechnical factors that
                   distinguish successful from unsuccessful collaboratories. </p>
<p>Collaboratories to support scientific research have been around for at least two decades, and have emerged as an important form of
                   cyberinfrastructure to enable ever more ambitious geographically distributed research projects.  A broadened view of what a collaboratory is
                   suggests there are a variety of kinds of functions they could support. </p>
<p>Early collaboratories were often rather narrow in focus, but some have broadened to mimic fully-functional laboratories.  Furthermore, will
                   almost all early collaboratories were in the physical and biological sciences, by now they have emerged as serious research infrastructure in
                   most domains, including the social sciences and humanities. </p>
<p>Olson&#8217;s latest research focuses on how to support small groups of people working on difficult intellectual tasks, particularly when the members
                   of the group are geographically distributed.  This research has involved both field studies of groups attempting to do such work and lab studies
                   that evaluate specific technologies.  He is one of four Donald Bren Professors of Information and Computer Sciences at the Bren School. </p>

<p>Professor of Computer Science <strong>Gene Tsudik</strong> will be giving an invited keynote talk entitled "Secure and Usable Device Pairing" at the 5th <a href="http://www.ispec2009.net/">Information Security Practice and Experience Conference (ISPEC 2009)</a> to be held April 13-15, 2009, in Xi&#8217;an, China.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secure Device Pairing&#8221; is the process of bootstrapping a secure channel between two or more previously unassociated personal devices over a (usually wireless) human-imperceptible communication channel. Lack of prior security context and absence of common trust infrastructure open the door for so-called "Man-in-the-Middle" (or "Evil Twin") attacks. Mitigation of these attacks requires user involvement in the device pairing process.</p>
<p>Tsudik&#8217;s talk will summarize notable secure device pairing techniques, comparing and contrasting their advantages, shortcomings and limitations, followed by the first comprehensive and comparative evaluation of these methods.</p>
<p>ISPEC is an annual conference that brings together researchers and practitioners to provide a confluence of new information security technologies, their applications and their integration with IT systems in various vertical sectors.  More information about ISPEC can be found at the Conference Web site:  http://www.ispec2009.net/.</p>
<p>Tsudik's research interests are mainly in computer/network security, privacy and applied cryptography. His recent work focuses on privacy in Internet services, RFID systems and mobile ad hoc networks, as well as security in sensor networks and storage systems.</p>
<p>His research also covers secure group communication, in particular, group key agreement, group signatures and group access control. He also is interested in database security and public key cryptography. </p>
