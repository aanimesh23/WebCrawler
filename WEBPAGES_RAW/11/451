"<b>Process Model Customization for Technical and Non-Technical Users</b>"</A>,

<H2> Abstract </H2>

This paper focuses on two important requirements which must be
satisfied before widespread use of process programming in industrial
settings becomes a reality. First, a process programming language must
be customizable, allowing the user to fit the language into the
existing environment, rather than requiring the user to change
existing work environments, work procedures, or corporate culture to
meet the language's worldview. Second, the process programming
language should be accessible to all project personnel, both technical
and non-technical. This paper presents the Teamware category object
model, a new object model which has been developed to help meet these
key requirements. This object model supports development of customized
activity types, resource types, and artifact types to support the
needs of a particular corporation or project. These new types are
presented to non-technical end users as part of a "pre-existing"
language. The paper shows how the model differs from traditional class
systems. It also compares the customization support provided in
Teamware with that of other existing process systems and shows how
Teamware's category model allows definition of a higher level of
abstraction.
