ICS FACULTY PANEL ON IMPROVING YOUR GRADUATE SCHOOL APPLICATION

Time:  noon-1:50pm
Date:  Tues., 1 Nov., 2016
Place: Donald Bren Hall 6011

**** Pizza, soft drinks, and refreshments will be served. ****

Wondering what to do to improve your graduate school application?
Wondering how the process "really works," and what they look for?
Come to this ICS FACULTY PANEL to hear advice from the ICS faculty.

The very people who admit students into the ICS graduate programs
will give advice and answer your questions about graduate school
applications, the admissions process, Masters vs. Ph.D., what the
top-tier schools look for, how to improve your application, and
any other query or concern you may have about graduate school.

Next, a panel of current ICS graduate students will discuss their
experiences in successfully navigating graduate school admission.

Open Question-and-Answer periods will follow each panel discussion.
Please come prepared with any questions you may have.

Sophomores, Juniors, and Masters students are especially encouraged
to attend and beginning planning for graduate school now.

For students unable to attend the event, a video of the discussion
subsequently will be posted on the ICS SAO web page.

This presentation of the ICS Honors Program has been opened to
all interested students because of its broad general interest.
