<H2>Downloading Chimera</H2>

<p>&nbsp; 
Download Chimera 2.0 Beta from the following site:
<br>
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/chimera/software/index.html">
Chimera 2.0 Software page</A>
<br>
If you just want the Java byte-code file for Chimera 2.0b1, just download
the link labeled:
<br>
Chimera Class Files
</p>

<p> This links allows you to download the chimera.jar contains all the 
Java byte-code for Chimera 
2.0 Beta.  This is what you need to run Chimera.  You may place 
it anywhere you like.  A convenient spot would be a location you commonly
place your Java classes for your other Java programs.
</p>

<p>
You must then set the chimera.jar file up to be included in the 
CLASSPATH of your Java interpretor.  
</p>

<p> Look at the following links to see how you can set up your CLASSPATH to 
include the path to the chimera.jar file you have just downloaded:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><A HREF="chimera_classpath_setup_unix.html">
	Setting CLASSPATH in Solaris to include chimera.jar
	</A>&nbsp;</li>

    <li><A HREF="chimera_classpath_setup_nt.html">
	Setting CLASSPATH in Windows NT to include chimera.jar
	</A>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p> Note: Later on you will need to download client applications which 
will need to be placed in your CLASSPATH as well.  
</p>

<p> You are now ready to start the Chimera website.
