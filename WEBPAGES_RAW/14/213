Each week there will be two separate assignments available on this web page, usually by Friday afternoon: </font></P>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Garamond">Homeworks, which you will do individually over the weekend and show to the TA in lab on Monday. These will usually involve some reading and a few short problems to introduce you to a topic and help prepare you to ask questions and work in the lab the following week. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Garamond">Lab Assignments, which you will do in pairs and submit electronically at the end of your lab session the following Friday. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><FONT FACE="Garamond">The first week's lab assignment is very short so you can complete it at the first lab session on Monday, September 28.</FONT></p>
<p><FONT FACE="Garamond">The lab  assignments will require you to do pair programming:
  You and a classmate will work together at one computer, following <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h21/hw/pair.html">specific guidelines</a>.  This makes the scheduled lab
  hours on Monday/Wednesday/Friday particularly valuable as a time when everyone
  in the class (and the TA) is certain to be available.</FONT></p>
<P>
  <FONT FACE="Garamond">We encourage you to talk with each other and
help each other understand how to do the assignments.  There are some limits,
though.  Everyone should read the  <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h21/hw/collab.html">guidelines for collaboration and independent work</A>.</FONT></P>

most of the HtDP exercises from the homework (not the lab assignment) are available
on line; you need to log in using </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=2>i41</FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"> and the password we will give you in class.  Use this link for HtDP solutions; the solutions links in the on-line textbook aren't accessible to us.
A word of caution about the solutions:  You lose the
whole benefit of the do-yourself exercises if you look at the solution before
you actually try your best to answer the question yourself.  It&#39;s all too easy just to look at
the answer and say, &quot;Yeah, I would have gotten this.&quot; <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h21/hw/lab1.html">Lab Assignment 1</a> is due at the end of lab on Friday, October 2</FONT>.</LI>
