<h2>ICS 269, Fall 2005: Theory Seminar</h2>

<h1>Undirected ST-Connectivity in Log-Space</h1>

<h2>Nodari Sitchinava</h2>

<h3>October 28, 2005, in CS 259</h3>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>This talk will be a presentation of a paper
by Omer Reingold that won the Best Paper Award at STOC 2005.</p>

<p>The author of the paper presents a <i>deterministic</i> log-space algorithm
that solves st-connectivity in undirected graphs. As undirected
st-connectivity is complete for the class of problems solvable by
symmetric, non-deterministic, log-space computations (the class SL),
this algorithm implies that SL&nbsp;=&nbsp;L (where L is the class of problems
solvable by deterministic log-space computations).</p>
