<b>Install MinGW</b>
<p>
MinGW means <b>Min</b>imalist <b>G</b>NU for <b>W</b>indows: GNU is a source
  of open source programming tools (GNU stands for GNU is Not Unix).
<p>
In this handout you will download the files needed by GNU C++; in the next
  you will download a version of Eclipse that is already set up to use
  MinGW.
<p>
You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing MinGW.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely before performing the action that it
  describes.

<h3>Downloading</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click
       <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/" target="_blank">
     MinGW</a>.<p>
    The following page will appear in your browser (from the SourceForge
       web site).
       <p>
       <img src="images/00mingw.jpg">
       <p>

<li>Click the <b>Download mingw-get-setup.exe(86.5 kB)</b>
      link.
    <p>
    This file should start downloading in your standard download folder.
    This file is only 85KB so it should download very quickly.
    <p>
    The file should appear as
    <p>
    <img src="images/000setupexe.jpg">
    <p>
    Terminate the window browsing the SourceForge web site.

<p>
<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install MinGW
      (and reinstall it later, if necessary).
<p>
<li>Start the <b>Installation</b> instructions directly below.

    (I know this is weird).

    <img src="images/8downloadpackages.jpg">
    <p>
    After a while (a few minutes to an hour, depending on your download speed),
       it should start extracting the donwloaded files.
    A few minutes after that, the following pop-up window should appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/10close.jpg">
    <p>

<li>Click <b>Close</b>.

<p>
<li>Edit Path so that the <b>MinGW</b> and <b>MSYSM</b> software
      is findable by Eclipse.
    <ul>
    <li>Click <b>Start</b>
    <li>Click <b>Control Panel</b>
    <li>Click <b>System</b>
    <li>Click <b>Advance system settings</b>; you will see

    <img src="images/variables.jpg">
    <p>
    <li>In the <b>System variables</b> (lower) part, scroll to line starting
           with <b>Path</b> and click that line.<br>
        <b>IMPORTANT: Even though you see a highlighted PATH in the User
             variables (top part) look for Path (not CLASSPATH) in the lower
             part to change it.</b>
    <li>Click <b>Edit...</b>
    <li>Copy <b>C:\MinGW\bin;C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin;</b>
          (include everything from <b>C</b> to <b>;</b>) and then paste
          it at the very start of the <b>Variable Value</b> text entry.
        <p>
        When done it should look like
    <p>
    <img src="images/path.jpg">
    <p>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b> (3 times)
    </ul>
</ol>
MinGW is now installed.
You are now ready to install Eclipse....But it is probaby a good idea to
  reboot your machine first, to ensure the new path is correct.
