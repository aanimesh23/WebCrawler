<H2> Abstract </H2>

CATS (Concurrency Analysis Tool Suite) is designed to satisfy several 
criteria: it must analyze implementation-level Ada source code and check 
user-specified conditions associated with program source code; it must be 
modularized in a fashion that supports flexible composition with other 
tool components, including integration with a variety of testing and 
analysis techniques; and its performance and capacity must be sufficient 
for analysis of real application programs.  Meeting these objectives 
together is significantly more difficult than meeting any of them alone.
We describe the design and rationale of CATS and report experience with 
an implementation. The issues addressed here are primarily practical 
concerns for modularizing and integrating tools for analysis of actual 
source programs. We also report successfully applying CATS to major
subsystems of a (non-toy) highly concurrent user interface system (Chiron).
