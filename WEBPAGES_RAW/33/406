You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing Java.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely before performing the action that it
  describes.
This document shows downloading and installing Java 8 on Windows 7 in
  Summer 2015.

<h2>Java</h2><p>

The following instructions were composed for installing Sun Java 1.8.0_60
  (aka Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 8, Update 60).
<b>The version you download may be newer.</b>
<p>
The Java download requires about 1 MB of disk space; keep it on your machine,
  in case you need to reinstall Java.
When installed, Java requires about an additional 290 MB of disk space.

    This file should start downloading into your standard download folder.

<h3>Installing</h3>
<ol>
<li>Double click the <b>chromeinstall-8u60.exe</b>
      file that you just downloaded and moved.
    <p>
    In a few seconds a pop-up window titled <b>User Account Control</b> will
      appear, posing the question <b>Do you want the following program to
      install software on this computer?</b>
    <p>
    <img src="images/java/useraccountcontrol.jpg">

<p>
<li>Click the <b>Yes</b> button.
    <p>
    A <b>Java Setup - Welcome</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/java/setupwelcome.jpg">

<p>
<li>Click the <b>Next &gt;</b> button.
    <p>
    <ul>
      If an <b>Java Setup - Uninstall out-of-date versions</b> pop-up window
        appears, click the <b>Remind me Later</b> button.
    </ul>
    <p>
    A <b>Java Setup - Progress</b> pop-up window will appear, with the 
      following message at the top of the window:
        <b>Status: Installing Java</b>
    <p>
    <img src="images/java/setupprogress.jpg">
    <p>
    A green progress bar will appear, showing the progress as it installs
     Java, and will finally disappear (on my machine this took about
     30 seconds).
    Eventually, a <b>Java Setup - Complete</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/java/setupcomplete.jpg">
    <p>

<p>
<li>Click <b>Close</b>.
    <p>
    A browser will appear, with a red <b>Verify Java version</b> button.
    <p>
    <img src="images/java/verifyversion.jpg">

<p>
<li>Because of recent incompatabilities between Java and browsers, this test
      will typically not run correctly, so just terminate this browser.
    <p>
    If you know how to bring up system prompt/cmd window, you can test the Java
      installation by typing <b>java -version</b> in it.
    It should show.
    <p>
    <img src="images/java/javatest.jpg">
    <p>
    After seeing this message (or an error message), type <b>exit</b> in the
      <b>cmd.exe</b> window and press the <b>Enter</b> key.

</ol>
The installed files are typically stored (in Windows) in the folder
  <b>C:\Program Files (x86)\Java</b>.
Inside this folder should be the folder: <b>jre1.8.0_60</b>, which itself should
  contain a <b>bin</b> and <b>lib</b> folder, and some miscellaneous <b>.txt</b>
  and a <b>Welcome.html</b> file.
<p>
You may now follow the instructions to download and install Python or C++
  and/or the Eclipse IDE (for Python, Java, or C++).
Note: you need to download/install Java even if you are using Eclipse only
  for Python)
