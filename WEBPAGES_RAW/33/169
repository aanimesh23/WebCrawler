Approximating the Shortest Path in a Line Arrangement
<br>
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dhart/">David Hart</a>

<p>
Given a line arrangement and points s and t on lines of the arrangement,
the best known algorithm for finding a shortest path from s to t 
traveling on lines of the arrangement takes O(n^2) time.  We present
an algorithm that finds a 1+epsilon approximation of the path in 
O(nlogn + (n/epsilon^2) log(1/epsilon)) time.

<p>
We will also mention new progress in finding an exact shortest path.

<p>
This is a practice talk for... TBA.  It is substantially changed (and
hopefully "new and improved") from a previous talk on this topic.
