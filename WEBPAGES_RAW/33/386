<H2>Abstract</H2>
<p>
This data consists of sample of Auslan (Australian Sign Language) signs.
27 examples of each of 95 Auslan signs were captured from a native signer
using high-quality position trackers and instrumented gloves.

<H2> Data Characteristics</H2>

<H4>Source</H4>
<P>
Data was captured using a setup that consisted of:
<ul>
<li> Two Fifth Dimension Technologies (5DT) gloves, one right and one left
<li> Two Ascension Flock-of-Birds magnetic position trackers, one attached to 
each hand
<li> A four-port serial card to cope with four data sources
<li> A PC (128MB RAM, Intel Pentium II 266MHz) was used
</ul>
</P>

<P>
In terms of the quality of the data, the Flock system was far superior to
the Nintendo system also 
<a href="/databases/auslan/auslan.data.html">available
</a>
 from the same donor. Firstly, this was
a two-hand system. Secondly, each position tracker provided 6 degrees of
freedom - i.e. roll, pitch and yaw as well as x, y and z. The gloves also
provided a full five fingers of data. But the big improvements were in
resolution - both accuracy and temporal. Position and orientation were
defined to 14-bit accuracy, giving position information with a typical
positional error less than one centimetre and angle error less than one
half of a degree. Finger bend was measured with 8 bits per finger, of
which probably 6 bits were usable once the glove was calibrated. The
refresh rate of the complete system was close to 100 frames per second;
and all signals had significantly less noise than the Nintendo data.
</P>
<p>
Samples from a single signer (a native Auslan signer) were collected over
a period of nine weeks. In total, 27 samples per sign, and a total of 2565
signs were collected. The average length of each sign was approximately 57
frames.
</p>


<P>
See past usage for a more detailed discussion on the data collection methodology.
</P>

<H4>Signers</H4>
The data was collected from a volunteer native Auslan signer


<H4>Preprocessing</H4>
<P>
The data presented is the raw data with no filtering. 
</P>

<H4>Variable Descriptions</H4>
<PRE>
The following data were recorded for each hand:

* x position expressed relative to a zero point set slightly below the
  chin. Expressed in meters.

* y position expressed relative to a zero point set slightly below the
  chin. Expressed in meters.

* z position expressed relative to a zero point set slightly below the
  chin. Expressed in meters.

* roll expressed as a value between -0.5 and 0.5 with 0 being palm down.
Positive means the palm is rolled clockwise from the perspective of the
signer. To get degrees, multiply by 180.

* pitch expressed as a value between -0.5 and 0.5 with 0 being palm flat
(horizontal). Positive means the palm is pointing up. To get degrees,
multiply by 180.

* yaw expressed a value between -1.0 and 1.0 with 0 being palm straight
ahead from the perspective of the signer. Positive means clockwise from
the perspective above the signer. To get degrees, multiply by 180.

* Thumb bend measure between 0 and 1. 0 means totally flat, 1 means
totally bent. However, the finger bend measurements are not very exact.

* Forefinger bend measure between 0 and 1. 0 means totally flat, 1 means
totally bent. However, the finger bend measurements are not very exact.

* Middle finger bend measure between 0 and 1. 0 means totally flat, 1
means totally bent. However, the finger bend measurements are not very
exact.

* Ring finger bend measure between 0 and 1. 0 means totally flat, 1 means
totally bent. However, the finger bend measurements are not very exact.

* Little finger bend measure between 0 and 1. 0 means totally flat, 1
means totally bent. However, the finger bend measurements are not very
exact.

<H2>Data Format</H2>
<p>
The file consists of 9 subdirectories tctodd1-9. Each directory
consists of 3 samples of each sign, captured on a different
day. In total there are 95 different signs, with 27 samples per
sign. Signs were provided by a native signer volunteer.
</p>
<p>
Each file consists of a sequence of lines. Each line consists of
22 whitespace-separated numbers representing the 22 channels of
information. The list of channels can be found in the domain 
description file. It also lists the classes. More information
