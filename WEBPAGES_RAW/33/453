<h2>
Honors Seminar --- ICS H197
</h2>

ICS H197 provides an
opportunity for honors students to learn about the research taking place
in the ICS Department and to get involved with this research.  We assume
that you would like to learn what sort of research is
going on, which people do what, and how to get connected with a
research project.  The purpose of this course is to help you answer
those questions.

<p>

Two types of students take this course:
students in the ICS Honors Program (ICSHP), and students in the Campuswide
Honors Program (CHP).  In many ways the requirements are the same for
both types of students: you are to select a faculty advisor,
do two or more quarters of research with that advisor,
and produce a report which is considered to be of honors quality.

<p>

Students in the Campuswide Honors Program should discuss their plans
with counsellors in the CHP, in order to make sure that they are
meeting the research requirements of that program.

<p>

Two people primarily oversee the ICS Honors Program: the <i> honors
program advisor </i> (or more briefly just the <i> program
advisor</i>) is the faculty member in charge of the program, currently
Richard Lathrop.  The counsellor for the program, currently Neha
Rawal, will help orient students and track their progress.  Feel
free to ask us any questions about the Program.

<p>

The most important person for you is your <i> honors advisor </i> (note
that this is different from the program advisor). This is the faculty member
with whom you will do your project, and varies from student to
student.

<p>

Several types of meetings are planned for this seminar, including the
following.

<li> We will meet with you 
to give you an overview of the programs.  

<li> Most of the faculty research groups will give a presentation
about their research interests.

<li> We plan that current graduate students, and past or present 
honors students, will meet with you to discuss their experiences, and
to help give you a perspective on the research process from students'
points of view.

<li> We plan several special topics, including graduate school
and fellowships, use of the library as a research tool,
scientific writing and speaking, and possibly intellectual property
or scientific ethics.


<p>

<hr>

One of your major goals in this course is to gain an understanding of
what research is being pursued in the Department and what areas might
be of interest to you for your project.  This is crucial, since it
should help you complete your second goal, selection of your honors
advisor.  Remember that the arrangement must be mutually acceptable,
so there is no guarantee that the first faculty member you talk to
will say yes; it may be, for example, that they have no suitable
project in mind at the time you ask.

<p>

You should plan to complete your research by winter quarter of your
senior year.  It is not imperative that you begin your research
immediately next quarter if your schedule for graduation allows you
enough time.  However, there are some important advantages to starting
fairly soon, and we encourage you to begin by spring quarter.
Starting early gives you more flexibility with regard to finishing the
rest of your degree requirements, especially if you want to continue
the research for more than two quarters.  Also, students often find
that faculty who have supervised their honors research project are
good sources of letters of recommendation; if you wait until your
senior year to start your research, you may have to ask for letters of
recommendation before you have even completed your first quarter of
research.

<p>

<h3>
Course requirements:
</h3>

This course is graded Pass/Not Pass, and the principal formal
requirement is that you attend and participate.  Several of the class
exercises involve students giving feedback to fellow students, and
your active participation is necessary for everyone to get the most
benefit from this.  Occasional absences are inevitable given busy
schedules, and will be excused on a case-by-case basis; in general if
you have a reason to miss class it is OK, and otherwise you should
attend.  Make sure you sign the attendance sheet each class period you
attend.  (I will ask for a volunteer from the class to collect this
sheet each time and place it in my ICS mail box.)

<p>

Additionally, we will require a series of mini-assignments to help get
you started on doing research.  These will be intended to introduce
you to some of the basic steps in research: making collaborative
contacts, reviewing the literature, speaking, and writing, as well as
to make you aware of scholarship and graduate school opportunities.
Some of the possibilities we are considering include (a) research
scholarship opportunities; (b) attend the Grad School workshop, go to
the grad school fair, research one grad school, write up a brief
report; (c) literature search and write-up; (d) attend one colloqium
or seminar during the quarter, write up a brief report; (e) read one
research paper from the literature, criticize it; (f) make contact
with potential faculty members; (g) prepare short scientific or
technical abstracts and talks.  We would like your feed-back as to
which of these would be most useful.

<p>

<h3>
ICS 198: Honors Research:
</h3>

To complete the honors program you must do two quarters of
independent, supervised work (ICS 198) with your faculty advisor.  For
ICS majors, one of these 198s will substitute for one project course
in the area, <i> provided </i> that
the other project course you take is in a different area.
(In some cases, your advisor might ask
you to take a graduate course to substitute for the first quarter.)
Passing the 198s does not necessarily guarantee successful completion
of the honors program, however.  For the ICSHP, the results of your
honors work must be certified by your advisor and by the program advisor to be
of honors quality.  (Again, students in the CHP should keep in touch
with counsellors in that program about the requirements.)

<p>
<h3>
Finding an <i>  honors advisor: </i>
</h3>

You are responsible for making contact with faculty members to discuss
their research and find an advisor.  We require you to make at least
three contacts every quarter until you have found an advisor and
submitted the ``Initial Plan'' described next.  Until the ``Initial
Plan'' has been submitted, you must submit a ``Faculty Contact
Report'' to the Counselling Office every quarter.  This gives a brief
one-paragraph summary of the faculty contacts you have made in the
previous quarter (at least three).  This requirement begins the
quarter you take ICS H197.

<p>

To make a faculty contact, (a) review the department Computing
Research Review to determine research interests; (b) call or email
in advance, ask for any background reading material, and schedule an
appointment; (c) read the background material, if any, and possibly
make a trip to the library to find out more about the general area;
(d) show up for the interview prepared with a list of points about the
research area that you find interesting, and a list of questions about
the area that you would like to know more about; (e) after the
interview, send a thank-you note thanking the faculty member for their
time.

<p>

It is important not to be discouraged if your first few contacts don't
result in finding an appropriate faculty advisor.  Keep trying.  You
can improve your chances by first doing even more background reading
in the area before you talk to a faculty member, so that you appear to
be interested and informed.  You can also improve your chances by
talking to a wider variety of faculty members, which will expose you
to a wider range of research possibilities.  Do be sensitive to their
time constraints; don't be a bother, but do be persistent.

<p>

<h3>
Getting started:
</h3>

When you have found an advisor, work out a plan for how you
will begin to tackle the research.  Then fill out the ``Initial Plan''
form at the end of this document.  (In some cases your plan might be a
program of study at first, rather than a description of your specific
project.  In any case, though, a brief description of your plans and
goals should be included.)  This should be approved by both you and
your advisor, and submitted to the program advisor.  You are encouraged to discuss
your plans with the program advisor as they are forming.

It is important for you to maintain contact with your advisor, and
make sure you know whether s/he feels that your work is progressing
adequately.  As an extreme example, you want to avoid a situation in
which you don't talk to your advisor after your first meeting, turn in
a paper after two quarters of 198, and then find that the advisor
considers it to be inadequate.  To help avoid this sort of thing,
schedule regular meetings with your advisor to discuss your progress.

<p>

If you are in the CHP you should finish your research in accordance
with the requirements of the CHP.  The remainder of this document
formally applies only to ICSHP students.  However, we encourage
ICS students in the CHP also to follow these procedures so that we can keep
track of your progress.

<p>
<h3>
Completing the program:
</h3>


At the end of your second quarter
of independent study with your advisor, you should prepare a paper
describing the project and the results.  Again, the format may vary
considerably from one project to another.  For example, one student
might produce a well-documented program to be used in a lab in one of
our courses, and also provide a paper describing the design choices,
rationale, and experience with the use of the program.  Another
student might not do any programming, but rather do a statistical
study of the use of computers in some organization, and write a
careful scholarly interpretation of the results (perhaps 20 pages)
with appropriate references to the literature.

<p>

After the paper is complete, first have your advisor sign the ``Final
Report on the Honors Project'' form, then bring the signed form and
the paper to the program advisor to sign, and finally bring the form
with both signatures and the paper to the Counselling Office.  The
normal deadline is June 1; if you will be late, please make
arrangements with the Counselling Office well in advance.  Once the
paper is approved by your advisor and the form is signed by both
advisors, you are considered to have successfully completed the ICSHP.

<p>

If at any point in this process you have any questions, don't hesitate
to discuss them with the program advisor or Counselling Office.

Honors students may count passing the two 198s as meeting
one ICS project course requirement, <i> provided that</i> the other project
course is in a different area.  Which other project course do you plan
to take to meet the project course requirement
for ICS majors?
