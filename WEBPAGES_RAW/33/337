<p>This applet helps you to solve cryptograms, like the CryptoQuote
that is usually found in newspapers next to the crossword puzzle.
In a cryptogram, one letter stands for another and to solve it you
have to find what each of those letters are. For example,
QSADRZQQSM could stand for LONGFELLOW. Notice that each L is
replaced by a Q and each O is replaced by an S, etc. The
traditional method of solving a cryptogram involves using a paper
and pencil (and an eraser) to keep track of your substitutions.
This applet makes that process much easier in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the "Edit Cryptogram" checkbox is not checked, then you
can type a character over another one to replace all instances of
that character with the new one you typed. If there were any other
characters the same as the one you typed, they will be replaced
with the one you are replacing.</li>

<li>The "Solve" button turns on <a href="algo.html">an algorithm for
automatically solving cryptograms</a> which can often correctly
guess most or all of the letters in the puzzle. The algorithm will
continue improving its guesses until you press the "Stop" button.
If it is unable to finish the puzzle (for instance, because the
solution involves words not known to the algorithm) you can often
use its guesses as a starting point for your own solution.</li>
</ul>
