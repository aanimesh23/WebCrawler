<h2>Smiley Faces</h2>
<h4>Lab Assignment 1<br>
to prepare for Lab Exam 1</h4>
</center>
</div>

<p>This lab assignment gives you some practice in basic Java programming by asking you to implement the &#147;smiley faces&#148; example we&#146;ve been discussing in class &mdash; with a few additional wrinkles.</p>

<div class="section">
<hr>
<h3>Program Behavior and General Requirements</h3>
</div>

<p>In general, you are to write a Java program that draws one, two or three smiley faces on the screen, each with characteristics you provide, such as the color and the shape of the face itself, and of the eyes and mouth. You also implement methods that translate (move) the smiley as a whole, and that let you scale and translate each of the smiley&#146;s parts (the face, eyes and mouth). (Scaling the smiley face as a whole requires some knowledge of linear algebra, so we do not include that feature.)</p>

<p>The  <font class = "codefacesmall">SmileyGroup()</font> constructor contains the code that produces the faces. We suggest you write various bodies for <font class = "codefacesmall">SmileyGroup()</font> so that you gain experience in using the two smiley face constructors, the <font class = "codefacesmall">setAttributes()</font> method and the smiley face translation and scaling routines, and with drawing one, two and three faces.</p>

<p>Program behavior is straight-forward: when run, a graphics window and SmileyGroup are created, then SmileyGroup is given to the graphics routines, which draws the one, two or three smiley faces described by that SmileyGroup; the window is then made visible on the screen so that the user actually sees the smiley group. This approach, common in graphics environments, allows the programmer to fully construct a screen before showing it to the user. </p>

<p>Each face you make should have two eyes that are above an imaginary horizontal line through the center of the face, and a mouth that is below that imaginary line; the eyes and mouth should have colors that make them distinguishable from the face.  Within these parameters, you may make the faces look however you'd like.</p>

<p>The user clicks on the close box to close the window and stop the program.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
</div>

<p>Be sure that you have downloaded the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/LabManual/LabFiles/21Workspace.zip">ICS 21 Eclipse workspace</a>, and have set it up as described in the <a href="//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/LabManual/02-OrientationToLab.html">
Orientation to the Lab</a> section of this manual.  Many settings have been changed from Eclipse defaults to appropriately support your work in this course, so be sure that you&#146;re using this workspace. That way, not only will things be properly set up for your assignments, but your work will match the environment that you&#146;ll be using during lab exams.</p>

<p>Download the Eclipse project for this assignment and import it into your workspace:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the <a href="//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/LabManual/LabFiles/21Lab1.zip">Lab 1 Eclipse project, 21Lab1.zip</a>.</li>
  <li>Unzip it, producing a folder called <font class = "codefacesmall">21Lab1</font>.</li>
  <li>Move the <font class = "codefacesmall">Lab1</font> folder that&#146;s inside  <font class = "codefacesmall">21Lab1</font> into the folder containing your Eclipse workspace.  For example, if your workspace is in <font class = "codefacesmall">H:\21Workspace</font>, you&#146;d want to move the <font class = "codefacesmall">Lab1</font> folder into <font class = "codefacesmall">H:\21Workspace</font>.</li>
  <li>Start up Eclipse and select your workspace.</li>
  <li>From the <font class = "codefacesmall">File</font> menu, select <font class = "codefacesmall">Import...</font>, which will pop up a dialog box.  Under <font class = "codefacesmall">General</font>, select <font class = "codefacesmall">Existing Projects into Workspace</font>, then click <font class = "codefacesmall">Next &gt;</font>.</li>
  <li>Next to <font class = "codefacesmall">Select root directory</font>, click the <font class = "codefacesmall">Browse...</font> button.  Find the <font class = "codefacesmall">Lab1</font> folder that you copied into your workspace folder, select it, then click <font class = "codefacesmall">OK</font>.</li>
  <li>Finally, click <font class = "codefacesmall">Finish</font>.  You should now see a project called <font class = "codefacesmall">Lab1</font> in <font class = "codefacesmall">Package Explorer</font>.  Your <font class = "codefacesmall">Problems</font> window should show some warnings; each of these warnings indicates that there is a part of the program that has yet to be built.  (Not all warnings indicate this, but these warnings do.)</li>
</ol>

<p>As you work, Eclipse will compile your program automatically each time you save it.  Pay attention to changes in the <font class = "codefacesmall">Problems</font> window, especially errors, because these often indicate things that you&#146;ve either done incorrectly or things that you need to do to finish the part of the program you&#146;re working on.</p>

<h3>About Lab Exam 1</h3>
</div>

<p>Lab exam 1 will be similar, but not identical, to the program you are to code for this exercise. In particular, the assignment allows you the freedom to explore different combinations of smiley faces and their attributes; the lab exam instead will be quite specific about the characteristics of the faces you are to draw. Remeber to read <font class = "codefacesmall">INSTRUCTIONS!.txt</font> and program comments before beginning your coding; they will explain in detail what is required. Remember that you must follow the exam specifications <i>completely</i> to pass the exam and that a significant failure to follow class style standards can result in a &#147;not pass&#148; even if your program is otherwise complete and correct.</p>

<p>The lab exam will have you code one or more of the following methods:</p>

<ul>
	<li>From SmileyFace: the constructors; the translate method</li>
	<li>From SmileyGroup: the constructor</li>
	<li>From SmileyFacePart: the constructors; the translate, setAttributes, scale, setColor, setCenter, setXLength, and setYLength methods</li>
</ul>
