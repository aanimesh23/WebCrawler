The code is implemented with Java. The demonstration 
code can be found here: <a href="http://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/SSEA/SSEA_v1.0.jar">download
 SSEA</a>.<br>

</p><h3>Instruction of use </h3>
	
<p>

Input files: ( Example input files can be found here: <a href="http://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/SSEA/exampledata.zip"> example files</a>.<br>
<p>

<ul> 
1) SNP genotype file
<p>
The first line contains the SNP ID and a list of phenotype of the subjects,Ca if the subject belongs to case(disease) group, Co if the subject belongs to control group.
</p><p>
Line format: SNP_ID(tab)(subject 1 phenotype)(tab)(subject 2 phenotype)(tab) ... (subject N phenotype)
</p><p>
Exampleï¼šSNPID Ca_1    Co_1    Co_2    Co_3    Ca_2	...
</p><p>
The remainder of the data file contains data for all SNPs. Rows corresponds to SNPs, columns corresponds to genotype(use 1,2,3 to represent 3 different genotypes AA, AB,BB; use 0 to represent the missing genotype data).
</p><p>
Example: rs12082473      1       0       1       1       3	...
</p><p>

2) SNP to Gene Mapping file (annotation file)
</p><p>
Example: SNPId Gene_Name
</p><p>

3) Pathway file(the gene sets used for testing were downloaded together with the original GSEA software from KEGG)
</p><p> 
Example: Pathway_Name	annotation	Gene_Name1	Gene_Name2	Gene_Name3	...

3) Phenotype file(this can be obtain from the first line of SNP genotype file, look for example file for detail)
</p></ul>

Output:
<ul>
<p>
This package has two steps: it first use SNP genotype file and annotation file to generate Significant SNP files; together with pathway(SNPset) file would be used as an input for the second step. The 
final output file include the pathway name, pathway size, enrichment score and nominal p-value.
