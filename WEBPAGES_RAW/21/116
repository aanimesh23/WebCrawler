Considers sequence alignment and RNA structure problems
in which the solution is constructed by piecing together
some initial set of fragments (e.g. short sequences that match exactly).
The method is to consider a planar point set formed by
the fragment positions in the two input sequences,
and use plane sweep to construct a cellular decomposition of the plane
similar to the rectilinear Voronoi diagram.

In this paper, we construct triangulations of point sets and polygons by
using quadtrees to add extra vertices to the input. As a result we can
guarantee that all triangles have angles bounded
away from zero, using a number of triangles within a constant of
optimal; this was the first paper to provide simultaneous bounds on mesh
element quality and mesh complexity of this form, and therefore the
first to provide finite element mesh generation algorithms that
guarantee both the robustness of the algorithm against unexpected input
geometries and the quality of its output.
<p>
In the same paper we also use quadtrees to triangulate planar point sets
so that all angles are non-obtuse, using linearly many triangles, and to
triangulate higher dimensional point sets with no small solid angles and
a number of simplices within a constant of optimal.  Also, we can
augment any higher dimensional point set so the Delaunay triangulation
has linear complexity.
<p>
In later follow-up work, I showed that the same
technique can also be used to find a triangulation whose edges have <a
href="p-mwst.html">total length within a constant factor of
optimal</a>. Bern, Mitchell, and Ruppert
showed that alternative methods can be used to triangulate any polygon
without obtuse angles; see "<a href="p-cpack.html">Faster circle packing
with application to nonobtuse triangulation</a>" for an algorithmic
improvement to their technique. Additionally, with Bern, Chew, and
Ruppert, we showed that <a href-"p=dihedral.html">any point set in
higher dimensions can be triangulated with nonobtuse simplices</a>.
Bern and I surveyed these and related results in our paper "<a
href="p-meshgen.html">Mesh generation and optimal triangulation</a>".

Uses a divide and conquer on the edge set of a graph, together with the
idea of replacing subgraphs by sparser certificates, to make various
dynamic algorithms as fast on dense graphs as they are on sparse graphs.
Applications include random generation of spanning trees
as well as finding the <i>k</i>
<a href="mst.html">minimum weight spanning trees</a>
for a given parameter <i>k.</i>

This paper presents an algorithm that finds multiple short paths connecting
two terminals in a graph
(allowing repeated vertices and edges in the paths)
in constant time per path after a preprocessing stage
dominated by a single-source shortest path computation.
The paths it finds are the <i>k</i> shortest in the graph, where <i>k</i> is a
parameter given as input to the algorithm.
<p>
The <i>k</i> shortest paths problem has many important applications for finding
alternative solutions to geographic path planning problems, network
routing, hypothesis generation in computational linguistics, and
sequence alignment and metabolic pathway finding in
bioinformatics. Although there have been many papers on the
<i>k</i> shortest paths problem before and after this one, it has become
frequently cited in those application areas.
Additionally, it marks a boundary in the theoretical study of the problem:
prior theoretical work largely concerned how quickly the problem could
be solved, a line of research that was closed off by the optimal time
bounds of this paper. Subsequent work has focused instead
on devising efficient algorithms for more complex alternative
formulations of the problem that avoid the repeated
vertices and other shortcomings of the alternative paths produced by
this formulation.

We consider the problem of "connect the dots": if we have an unknown
smooth curve from which sample points have been selected, we would like
to find a curve through the sample points that approximates the unknown
curve.  We show that if the local sample density is sufficiently high, a
simple algorithm suffices: form the Delaunay
triangulation of the sample points together with their Voronoi vertices,
and keep only those Delaunay edges connecting original sample points.
There have been many follow-up papers suggesting alternative methods,
generalizing the problem to the reconstruction of curves with sharp
corners or to curves and surfaces in higher dimensions, etc.

<li><b>Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families</b>.<br>
D. Eppstein.<br>
<a href="//arXiv.org/abs/math.CO/9907126">arXiv:math.CO/9907126</a>.<br>
<i>Algorithmica</i> 27: 275&ndash;291, 2000
(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).
<p>
This paper introduces the <i>diameter-treewidth
property</i> (later known as <i>bounded local treewidth</i>): a
functional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.
Previously known results imply that planar graphs have
bounded local treewidth; we characterize the
other minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,
minor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there
exists an <i>apex graph</i> G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph
that can be made planar by removing a single vertex.
The minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have
bounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus
graphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the
treewidth as a function of the diameter) and K<sub>3,a</sub>-free graphs.  As
a consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and
approximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed
efficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar
graphs.
<p>Some of these results
were announced in the conference version of
"<a href="p-psgi.html">subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related
problems</a>" but not included in the journal version. Since its
publication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of
problems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local
treewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, "<a
href="//doi.org/10.1145/504794.504798">Deciding first-order
properties of locally tree-decomposable structures</a>", <i>J. ACM</i>
48: 1184&ndash;1206, 2001;
the proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an
excluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth
on diameter
improved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, "<a href="//erikdemaine.org/papers/DiameterTreewidth_Algorithmica/">Diameter and
treewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited</a>", <i>Algorithmica</i>
40: 211&ndash;215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the
theory of <i>bidimensionality</i>, a general framework for
fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in
minor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,
"<a href="//erikdemaine.org/papers/BidimensionalSurvey_CJ/">The
bidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications</a>", <i>The

We describe a decomposition of graphs embedded on 2-dimensional
manifolds into three subgraphs: a spanning tree, a dual spanning tree,
and a set of leftover edges with cardinality determined by the genus of
the manifold.  This tree-cotree decomposition allows us to find
efficient data structures for
<a href="graph-dyn.html">dynamic graphs</a> (allowing updates
that change the surface), better constants in bounded-genus graph
separators, and efficient algorithms for tree-decomposition of
bounded-genus bounded-diameter graphs.

We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising
in the worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style
<a href="exponential.html">exponential time
backtracking algorithms</a> for NP-hard problems. We describe a
technique for proving asymptotic upper bounds on these recurrences,
by using a suitable weight function to reduce the problem to that of
solving univariate linear recurrences; show how to use <a
href="geom-lp.html">quasiconvex programming</a> to determine the weight
function yielding the smallest
upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We
develop and implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the
resulting quasiconvex programs, using a real-number arithmetic
package for guaranteed accuracy of the computed worst case time
bounds.

The journal version uses the longer title "Quasiconvex analysis of
multivariate recurrence equations for backtracking algorithms".

This talk and journal paper combines the results from
"<a href="p-lombardi-subcubic.html">Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs</a>" and "<a href="p-planar-soap.html">The graphs of
planar soap bubbles</a>".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under M&ouml;bius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.
