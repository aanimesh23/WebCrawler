<H2 CLASS="western"><font style="font-size: 14pt">A1. Distributed Configuration Manager 
for P2P Dissemination System (2~3 students)</font></H2>
<div style="width:90%"align="justify">
The goal of this project is to implement a DHT-based configuration manager for 
performing application layer multicasting over a set of distributed nodes. In a 
P2P system, nodes can join/leave dynamically, and the manager of the system will 
handle node&#39;s join/leave/update asynchronously. The manager implemented in Java 
will execute on multiple machines that communicate using the PASTRY API to store/retrieve data. Requirements: Client/Server programming, data structure programming, TCP/UDP socket programming techniques.

<div style="width:90%"align="justify">
The goal of this project is to develop simulators for testing GeoAware Multicasting System 
whose goal is to guarantee that a node can disseminate a message to all nodes in 
a certain target region. The project will compare two types of systems: Proxy based system and Pure P2P system. Each system has 
its own base protocol to handle nodes join/leave, establish routing tables, 
split/merge zone and etc. Java or C++ is preferred. Proxy based system needs 1-2 students.
Pure P2P system needs 1-2 students.

The goal of this project is to test a bunch of application layer multicasting protocols with 
the Oversim simulator.
There are protocols already implemented in the Oversim package, and we can use them for general testing.

<p></p><H2 CLASS="western"><font style="font-size: 14pt">B1. Interoperable Distributed Simulation</font></H2>
<div style="width:90%"align="justify">
Modeling and simulation is required in many areas of science and engineering, for example,
for predicting the behavior of new systems being designed or for analyzing natural phenomena.
These simulation systems often require collaborative effort from researchers with
different domain knowledge and expertise, possibly at different locations.
There are several benefits to distributed simulations:
<ol>
<li> Reduced execution time - subdividing a large simulation computation into many subcomputations,
     and executing these subcomputations concurrently can reduce execution time.
<li> Geographical distribution - executing the simulation program on a set of geographically
     distributed computers enables one to create virtual worlds with multiple participants
     that are physically located at different sites.
<li> Fault tolerance - if one computer goes down, it may be possible for other computers
     to pick up the work of the failing machine, allowing the simulation computation to proceed despite the failure.
</ol>
The goal of this project is to design and implement a distributed simulation.
First, we study the evolution of distributed simulation tools and standards (e.g. DIS, ALSP and HLA).
Then we take a small and simplified example (simulation model) and try to
identify all basic issues for distributed simulation through a detailed case study implementation and development.

<H2 CLASS="western"><font style="font-size: 14pt">B2. Applicability of HLA for Distributed Simulation</font></H2>
<div style="width:90%"align="justify">
The High Level Architecture (HLA) specification is a standard architecture initiated
by the U.S. Department of Defense to support the interoperability among the distributed simulators.
In this project we aim to develop a case study to build a distributed simulation using
pre-existing simulation models integrated through HLA.While generally within the defence domain
we can see a big drive in interoperability of simulation models and common application of HLA,
we are not aware of much effort in other domains. It seems that HLA is still rarely applied as it stands now.
In this project we want to investigate to find out the reasons behind this phenomenon.
In the first part of the project we study HLA, its properties, and the existence
of successful projects on integration through HLA. In the second part we build a distributed
simulation using HLA and identify the problems and difficulties with HLA.

<p></p><H2 CLASS="western"><font style="font-size: 14pt">C1. Centralized or Decentralized? (2~3 students)</font></H2>
<div style="width:90%"align="justify">
In this project, we will implement an application for transmitting data across 
mobile devices equipped with multiple access networks. Data in this system can be a short message (say 10 bytes). Nowadays, Android phones are equipped with 2 network interfaces: 3G network and IEEE 802.11 network. While 3G base station can communicate
with all devices in its coverage, its data rate is low and its resources are valuable. IEEE 802.11 network has a much lower transmission range,
but its data rate is very high (IEEE 802.11g supports up to 54 Mbps data rate) and its resources are not usually used. 
In our proposed system, we want to use IEEE 802.11 as much as possible and save 3G network's resources. Thus, 
two devices will communicate with each other using the 802.11 network in IEEE 802.11 transmission range (decentralized mode), 
rather than using 3G network (centralized mode). In our application, mobile nodes will notify their presence by 
periodically broadcasting beacons. Knowledge of Java and Android must be required.

<div style="width:90%"align="justify">
H.264/SVC is a new video coding standard which supports efficiently video streaming over wireless networks in which bandwidth 
usually
fluctuates. In this project, we will implement an application that streams video from a server (probably a laptop) to Android phones
using H.264/SVC over WiFi networks. Knowledge of Java, socket programming and 
Android is required.<br><br>

<p></p><H2 CLASS="western"><font style="font-size: 14pt">C3. Data distribution over hybrid cellular and ad hoc networks (2~3 students)</font></H2>
<div style="width:90%"align="justify">
Pure cellular networks usually provide low throughput due to their low data rate. To improve throughput, people 
design a new kind of network: hybrid cellular and ad hoc network in which base station transmits data to
some mobile devices which then forward the receiving data to their neighboring nodes. 
This kind of network even supports data distribution from a mobile device to another device through multi-hop path.
In this project, you will implement a previous work, 
"<a href="reading/01644746.pdf">ICAM: Integrated Cellular and Ad Hoc Multicast</a>", 
for distributing data over hybrid cellular and ad hoc networks on a packet level simulator - Qualnet. 
To simplify our work, we need to implement only one of two algorithms proposed in the paper:
Greedy algorithm or Near Optimal algorithm. Then you will run some experiments to see how much throughput is
improved by hybrid networks compared to pure cellular networks?

<div style="width:90%"align="justify">
In this project we are trying to use nearby data centers or public
cloud to speed up your smart phone applications. We have considered
two-tier model for cloud. The first one is the public and backbone
clouds and the other one is private cloud and data centers. We
proposed a middleware solution which optimally could breakdown the
application workflow between cloud and smart phones. An example of an
application using this middleware: we have considered an intensive
image processing application. As part of this project, we will develop a service 
called Image Processing Web Service. By using some
open source image processing libraries, we will make it available
on the web as the web service. The main image processing functionality
is to process the text image (using some available open source OCR),
Image Format Conversion. The main responsibility of the student is to implement the
component-based image processing web service and perform some experiments
on it using nearby clouds or public clouds such as Amazon.<br><br>

<H2 CLASS="western"><font style="font-size: 16pt">D. Projects on Energy harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks</font></H2>
<div style="width:90%"align="justify">
Energy harvesting systems are able to harvest energy from the surrounding environment. One example is harvesting energy from the sun. 
In this project, we consider a network of sensor nodes, each powered by a solar cell. Sensor nodes collect data and send to a base station at 
some frequency/rate. A challenge is that solar energy varies greatly, both in term of location and time. 
The goal of these two projects is to understand the impact and exploit temporal and spatial availability of harvested solar energy on data transmission applications.
 The first step is to simulate this solar harvesting network in a network simulator assuming a simple application sensing and sending data at a fixed rate. 
 You then measure performance by metrics such as actual data transmission rate, package loss… under different solar profiles (sunny day, rainy day, solar-exposed location, 
 shadow location…).

<p></p><H2 CLASS="western"><font style="font-size: 14pt">D1. Project 1 (2-3 students)</font></H2>
<div style="width:90%"align="justify">
In this project, we want to tackle challenges of harvesting energy systems from application/middleware perspective. 
The middleware will adapt and choose a suitable data transmission rate for each sensor rather than a fixed rate to exploit temporal and spatial availability of harvested energy. 
This paper is one example, "<a href="reading/p239-fan.pdf">Steady and Fair Rate Allocation for Rechargeable Sensors in Perpetual Sensor Networks</a>" by Kai-Wei Fan, Zizhan Zheng, Prasun Sinha. 
Implement your middleware in a network simulator, measure its performance and compare with the simple approach in the previous step.

<div style="width:90%"align="justify">
In this project, we want to tackle the challenges of harvesting energy systems from MAC-layer perspective. 
A harvest-aware routing protocol should change and adapt routing paths/network topology according to available harvested energy 
at different nodes at different time. One example is "<a href="reading/05504633.pdf">Analysis, Comparison, and Optimization of Routing Protocols for Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks</a>" by David Hasenfratz, Andreas Meier, Clemens Moser, Jian-Jia Chen, and Lothar Thiele. Implement your protocol in a network simulator, measure its performance and compare with other proposed harvest-aware routing protocols from your literature survey and/or with other conventional routing protocols which are not harvest-aware.<br><br>

<H2 CLASS="western"><font style="font-size: 16pt">E. Projects on Clustering Schemes in Multinetwork</font></H2>
<div style="width:90%"align="justify">
A multinetwork environment consists wired network, wireless LAN, wireless sensor network, 
wireless mesh network, and wireless ad hoc network, etc. Nodes in multinetwork environment 
include mobile devices, sensors (fixed or mobile), wireless network components 
(access point, routers, mesh routers, and etc.). Devices communicate using specific wireless protocols 
such as 802.11, ad hoc protocol, mesh protocol and broadcast protocol. 
Much of the existing researches address organization and topology management in single wired or 
wireless network.  An efficient framework for organizing nodes in multinetwork environment is needed. 
Our focus here is on dealing multiple wireless network than coexist in a given space to exchange 
data among nodes in a timely, reliable and efficient manner. 

We adopt clustering as the basic organization method in that frame work. 
In a clustering scheme the mobile nodes in an ad hoc network are divided into different 
virtual groups based on their geographic proximity. Under a cluster structure, mobile nodes 
may be assigned a different status or function, such as cluster head, cluster gateway, or cluster member. 
A cluster head normally serves as a local coordinator for its cluster, performing intra-cluster 
transmission arrangement, data forwarding, and so on. A cluster gateway is a non-cluster head node 
with inter-cluster links, so it can access neighboring clusters and forward information between clusters. 
A cluster member is usually called an ordinary node, which is a non-cluster head node without 
any inter-cluster links. Cluster scheme has several advantages: First, a cluster structure facilitates 
the spatial reuse of resources to increase the system capacity. The second benefit is the generation 
and spreading of routing information can be restricted in this set of nodes. Last, local changes need
 not be seen and updated by the entire network, and information processed and stored by each mobile node 
 is greatly reduced.

Clustering mechanisms can be designed to optimize various aspects of communication, i.e. 
reduced latency, messaging overhead, and/or energy consumption.

The following projects focus on building clustering schemes that optimize latency and energy.

     Latency aware implies the clustering scheme will consider end to end latency 
     as the most important performance goal. In this project, we will choose two latency 
     aware clustering algorithms from highly-cited papers. Then we will comprise those polices 
     with base line and analyze the results. 
     NS2 will be used as the simulator platform. <br><br>
