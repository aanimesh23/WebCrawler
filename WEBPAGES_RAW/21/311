<h2><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="6">Overview</font></b></h2>

<p>Workflow modeling can be used to represent and/or augment a current workflow activity
network. A workflow activity network is a fancy name for people working together in an
organization. A workflow model can be represented by a network of tasks (work nodes) and
flows (directed arcs between tasks). A task is defined as a person (or group) using a tool
(or toolset) while following a process to produce a useful output (artifact(s) and/or
data) from an input (artifact(s) and/or data). A task consists 3 main nodes, person/role,
tool, and process, and directed links (arcs) between these nodes. See <a
href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mbergman/ICS12%205/ics125_wfui.htm%20#Figure1">Figure 1</a><a
name="Figure1"></a>. <br>

<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mbergman/ICS12%205/ics125_wfui.htm%20#Figure1">Figure 1</a>
Note: For clarity, the links from the Input to the internal task nodes and from these
nodes to the Output have been omitted. These should be available, if a designer wants to
use them. <br>
<br>
A flow is a set of connections (directed arcs) from one task to another. The arcs that
make up a flow are seen in <a
href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mbergman/ICS12%205/ics125_wfui.htm%20#Figure2">Figure 2</a>.
A flow can be considered a <i>bus</i><a name="Figure2"></a> representation of these arcs
between the task nodes. <br>

Note: Although these links look disconnected, they are actually connections between the
stated nodes via the In/Out connectors. <br>
<br>
There are subnetworks that are represented within a workflow network. The 3 main
subnetworks are the social network (people to people), the technical network (tool to
tool) and the process network (process to process). These subnetworks should be viewable
individually as well. Arcs for these subnetworks can exist and connect without going
through an In/Out connector pair. <br>

<h2><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="6">Project Requirements</font></b></h2>

<p>This project is focused on creating an editor which can be used to construct workflow
models. The general functions of there editor are: 

<ul>
  <li>Identifying and classifying all of the workflow components: nodes, arcs, encapsulation
    and input/output connectors, artifacts &amp; data <ul>
      <li>Identification should include (but is not limited to): unique, easily identifiable
        object shapes, text tags, hyperlink references, colors, and mouse rollover popup
        information and menu choices </li>
      <li>Nodes and arcs should be open and extensible (i.e. able to be connected to lower and
        alternative levels of detail, but have these connection be specified at a later time) <ul>
          <li>Minimally, nodes and arcs should be able to point to underlying text details. This can
            include hyperlinking or equivalent. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Arc &amp; Flow Control <ul>
          <li>All arcs and flows are single directed <ul>
              <li>Dual directed arcs can be represented by a bundled/grouped pair of single directed arcs </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Arcs can be (but do not have to be) bundled into flows (See <a
            href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mbergman/ICS12%205/ics125_wfui.htm%20#Figure2">Figure 2</a>,
            above) </li>
          <li>Arcs &amp; flows need to able to be split and joined (split and join can be control
            components) </li>
          <li>(Optional) Other control components - loops, conditionals, case-switch blocks, etc. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Inputs &amp; Outputs <ul>
          <li>Contain a list of required artifacts, data and/or text based requirements need to enter
            or leave a task node </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Editing (add, copy, cut, paste, delete, modify, move) workflow components </li>
  <li>Encapsulation, i.e. grouping, of tasks, flows, subworkflows and other subnetworks </li>
  <li>Routing of arcs between nodes (autorouting is preferred) </li>
  <li>Viewing <ul>
      <li>Navigation through encapsulation levels </li>
      <li>Choosing which type of network or subnetwork (task, social, tool, process) to view </li>
      <li>Zooming (in &amp; out) and scrolling (via a &quot;view window&quot;) through workflow
        networks </li>
      <li>Path Selection: The ability to &quot;light up a path&quot; between any two, or more
        selected nodes </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Storage and retrieval of models <ul>
      <li>Models are to be stored in a flat file XML format </li>
      <li>Storage means &quot;Save&quot; and &quot;Save As&#133;&quot; model files </li>
      <li>The ability for a single model to link across multiple files models </li>
      <li>(Optional) The ability to &quot;Include&quot; files within a model </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><br>
The model is to be general enough to represent any kind of observed workflow, yet have the
capability to show increasing levels of workflow details, i.e. encapsulation. <br>
<br>
Finally, the editor should be able to be treated as a plug-in/applet into a Web browser
(Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer). <br>
