<h1>  A New Approach to Incremental Topological Ordering</h1>
<h2> by Michael A. Bender, Jeremy T. Fineman, and Seth Gilbert, appeared in SODA '09.</h2>
<h2> Presented by Darren Strash, UC Irvine </h2>


<p>
Consider the following problem: We begin with a graph consisting of n 
nodes and zero edges. An adversary adds m edges to the graph, one 
edge at a time. Throughout this process, we would like to maintain 
a topological ordering of the graph. I will discuss a recent paper 
which presents a new algorithm that has a total running time of 
O(n2 log n) for maintaining the topological ordering throughout 
all the edge insertions.
