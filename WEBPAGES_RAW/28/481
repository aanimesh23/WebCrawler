<h1>String matching</h1>

You probably often use your text editor (or the UNIX program
"grep") to find some text in a file (e.g. the place where you
defined your depth first search program, or the email message you
sent six weeks ago asking for an extension on your programming
project). 

<p>How does it do it?</p>

<p>There are two commonly used algorithms: Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
and <a href="people.html#boyer">Boyer</a>-<a href=
"people.html#moore">Moore</a> (BM). Both use similar ideas. Both
take linear time: O(m + n) where m is the length of the search
string, and n is the length of the file. Both only test whether
certain characters are equal or unequal, they don't do any
complicated arithmetic on characters.</p>

<p>Boyer-Moore is a little faster in practice, but more
complicated. Knuth-Morris-Pratt is simpler, so it's the one we'll
discuss. The book talks about it in terms of finite state machines
which would be fine if you'd taken 162 but you haven't....</p>

<h2>Finite state machines</h2>

A finite state machine (FSM, also known as a deterministic finite
automaton or DFA) is a way of representing a <i>language</i>
(meaning a set of strings; we're interested in representing the set
strings matching some pattern). 

<p>It's explicitly algorithmic: we represent the language as the
set of those strings <i>accepted</i> by some program. So, once
you've found the right machine, you can test whether a given string
matches just by running it.</p>

<p>The KMP algorithm works by turning the pattern it's given into a
machine, and then running the machine. The hard part of KMP is
finding the machine.</p>

<p>We need some restrictions on what we mean by "program". This is
where "deterministic &amp; finite" come from.</p>

<p>One way of thinking about it, is in terms of programs without
any variables. All such a program can do is look at each incoming
character determine what line to go to, and eventually return true
or false (depending on whether it thinks the string matches or
doesn't).</p>

<p><a name="even">As a simple warmup example, let's look at a
program for an easier problem: testing whether a string has an even
number of characters.</a></p>

<pre>
    main()
    {
        for (;;) {
            if (getchar() == EOF) return TRUE;
            if (getchar() == EOF) return FALSE;
        }
    }
</pre>

Note the lack of variables. To simplify things, we'll rewrite
programs to avoid complicated loops, and instead just use <a name= 
"goto">goto statements</a>. (You've probably been taught that gotos
are bad, but this sort of rewriting happens all the time, in fact
every time you run a compiler it has to do this.) 

<pre>
    main()
    {
        even:
            if (getchar() == EOF) return TRUE;
            else goto odd;

        odd:
            if (getchar() == EOF) return FALSE;
            else goto even;
    }
</pre>

We've chosen labels for the goto statements, to represent what we
know about the string so far (in this problem, whether we've seen
an even or odd number of characters so far). Because there are no
variables, we can only represent knowledge about the input in terms
of where we are in the program. We think of each line in the
program as being a <a name="state"><i>state</i></a>, representing
some specific fact about the part of the string we've seen so far.
Here the states are "even" and "odd", and represent what we know
about the number of characters seen so far. 

<p>Since there are no variables, the only thing a machine can do in
a given state (state = what line the prog is on) is to go to
different states, depending on what character it sees.</p>

<p>This can be a useful programming style; for instance I am using
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/filter.html"> a
program written in close to this style</a> to filter some html
files on my web pages. One advantage of this style is that there
are few ways the program can be tricked into having unexpected
values in its variables (since there are no variables) so it is
hard to make such a program crash. But it's a little long and
cumbersome, and you wouldn't want to have to compile a separate C
program every time you ran "grep".</p>

<p>Rather than writing C code, we'll draw pictures with circles and
arrows. (These pictures are known as <a name="diag"><i>state
diagrams</i></a>.) A circle will represent a state, an arrow with a
label will represent that we go to that state if we see that
character. (You can think of this as just being a special kind of
graph.) We'll also draw an arrow from nowhere to the first state
the program starts in, and arrows to nowhere if the program returns
true if the string ends at that state. So our program can be
represented with the following diagram.</p>

<p><img src="parity.gif" width="217" height="128"></p>

<p>In class I described a more complicated example, that could be
used by the <a name="cpp"><i>C preprocessor</i></a> (a part of most
C compilers) to tell which characters are part of comments and can
be removed from the input:</p>

<p><img src="comment.gif" width="460" height="279"></p>

<p>It's easy to turn such a diagram into a program, that simply has
one label and one case statement per state.</p>

<p>If we're given such a diagram, and a string, we can easily see
whether the corresponding program returns true or false. Simply
place a marker (such as a penny) on the initial state, and move it
around one state at a time until you run out of characters. Once
you run out of characters, see whether the state you're in has an
"accept" arrow -- if so, the pattern matches, and if not it
doesn't.</p>

<p>In a computer, we obviously don't represent these things with
circles and arrows. Instead they can be viewed as just being a
special kind of graph, and we can use any of the normal <a href= 
"960201.html#rep">graph representations</a> to store them.</p>

<p>One particularly useful representation is a <a name="tt"><i>
transition table</i></a>: we make a table with rows indexed by
states, and columns indexed by possible input characters. Then
simulating the machine can be done simply by looking up each new
step in the table. (You also need to store separately the start and
accept states.) For the machine above that tests whether a string
has even length, the table might look like this:</p>

<pre>
                any
                ---
    even:       odd
    odd:        even
</pre>

For the C comment machine, we get a more complicated table: 

<pre>
                /       *       EOL     other
                ---     ---     ---     ---
    none:       slash   none    none    none
    slash:      C++     C       none    none
    C++:        C++     C++     none    C++
    C:          C       star    C       C
    star:       none    star    C       C
</pre>

Since a state diagram is just a kind of graph, we can use graph
algorithms to find some information about finite state machines.
For instance we can simplify them by eliminating <a name="unreach">
unreachable states</a>, or find the shortest path through the
diagram (which corresponds to the <a name="ssa">shortest string
accepted</a> by that machine). 

<h2>Automata and string matching</h2>

The examples above didn't have much to do with string matching.
Let's look at one that does. Suppose we want to <a name="nano">
"grep nano"</a>. Rather than just starting to write states down,
let's think about what we want them to mean. At each step, we want
to store in the current state the information we need about the
string seen so far. Say the string seen so far is "...stuvwxy",
then we need to know two things: 

<ol>
<li>Have we already matched the string we're looking for
("nano")?</li>

<li>If not, could we possibly be in the middle of a match?</li>
</ol>

If we're in the middle of a match, we need to know how much of
"nano" we've already seen. Also, depending on the characters we
haven't seen yet, there may be more than one match that we could be
in the middle of -- for instance if we've just seen "...nan", then
we have different matches if the next characters are "o..." or if
they're "ano...". But let's be optimistic, and only remember the
longest partial match. 

<p>So we want our states to be partial matches to the pattern. The
possible partial matches to "nano" are "", "n", "na", "nan", or
(the complete match) "nano" itself. In other words, they're just
the <a name="prefix"><i>prefixes</i></a> of the string. In general,
if the pattern has m characters, we need m+1 states; here m=4 and
there are five states.</p>

<p>The start and accept states are obvious: they are just the 0-
and m-character prefixes. So the only thing we need to decide is
what the transition table should look like. If we've just seen
"...nan", and see another character "x", what state should we go
to? Clearly, if x is the next character in the match (here "o"), we
should go to the next longer prefix (here "nano"). And clearly,
once we've seen a complete match, we just stay in that state. But
suppose we see a different character, such as "a"? That means that
the string so far looks like "...nana". The longest partial match
we could be in is just "na". So from state "nan", we should draw an
arrow labeled "a" to state "na". Note that "na" is a prefix of
"nano" (so it's a state) and a <a name="suffix"><i>suffix</i></a>
of "nana" (so it's a partial match consistent with what we've just
seen).</p>

<p>In general the transition from state+character to state is the
longest string that's simultanously a prefix of the original
pattern and a suffix of the state+character we've just seen. This
is enough to tell us what all the transitions should be. If we're
looking for pattern "nano", the transition table would be</p>

<pre>
        n       a       o       other
        ---     ---     ---     ---
    empty:  "n"     empty   empty   empty
    "n":    "n"     "na"    empty   empty
    "na":   "nan"   empty   empty   empty
    "nan":  "n"     "na"    "nano"  empty
    "nano": "nano"  "nano"  "nano"  "nano"
</pre>

For instance the entry in row "nan" and column n says that the
largest string that's simultaneously a prefix of "nano" and a
suffix of "nan"+n="nann" is simply "n". We can also represent this
as a state diagram: 

<p><img src="nano.gif" width="421" height="156"></p>

<p>Simulating this on the string "banananona", we get the sequence
of states empty, empty, empty, "n", "na", "nan", "na", "nan",
"nano", "nano", "nano". Since we end in state "nano", this string
contains "nano" in it somewhere. By paying more careful attention
to when we first entered state "nano", we can tell exactly where it
occurs; it is also possible to modify the machine slightly and find
all occurrences of the substring rather than just the first
occurrence.</p>

<p>This description is enough to get a string matching algorithm
that takes something like O(m^3 + n) time: O(m^3) to build the
state table described above, and O(n) to simulate it on the input
file. There are two tricky points to the KMP algorithm. First, it
uses an alternate representation of the state table which takes
only O(m) space (the one above could take O(m^2)). And second, it
uses a complicated loop to build the whole thing in O(m) time.
We'll see this algorithm next time.</p>
