My Own Contributions to the Junkyard
</H2>
Some of the pages here are things I've thought about myself,
and others are my expositions of the ideas of others. 
Some of them are pages on my own site, and others are
pages on other sites describing my work.
I'll leave as an open problem determining which is which.

<li><a href="acute-square/">Acute square triangulation</A>.
Can one partition the square into triangles with all angles acute?
How many triangles are needed, and what is the best angle bound possible?

<LI><A HREF="box-in-box.html">Box in a box</A>.
What is the smallest cube that can be put inside another cube
touching all its faces?
There is a simple solution, but it seems difficult to prove its correctness.
The solution and proof are even prettier in four dimensions.

total length approximately 5.1547, but better bounds were previously known.

A factoid about similar triangles inspired by a trigonometric identity.
<p>
<LI><A HREF="maxmatch.html">Centers of maximum matchings</A>.
Andy Fingerhut asks, given a maximum (not minimum) matching of six
points in the Euclidean plane, whether there is a center point
close to all matched edges (within distance a constant times the length
of the edge).  If so, it could be extended to more points via Helly's theorem.
Apparently this is related to communication network design.
I include a response I sent with a proof (of a constant worse than the
one he wanted, but generalizing as well to bipartite matching).

<LI><A HREF="http://pauillac.inria.fr/algo/bsolve/constant/circle/circle.html">Circular

<LI><A HREF="http://mathforum.org/~sarah/HTMLthreads/articletocs/largest.equil.tri.html">Equilateral
triangles</A>.  Dan Asimov asks how large a triangle will fit into a
square torus; equivalently, the densest packing of equilateral triangles
in the pattern of a square lattice.
There is only one parameter to optimize, the angle of the triangle to
the lattice vectors; <A HREF="tripack.html">my answer</A>
is that the densest packing occurs when
this angle is 15 or 45 degrees, <A HREF="tripack.ps">shown below</A>.
(If the lattice doesn't have to be square, it is possible to get density
2/3; apparently this was long known, e.g. see F&aacute;ry,
Bull. Soc. Math. France 78 (1950) 152.)

<P>Asimov also asks for the smallest triangle that will always cover at least
one point of the integer lattice, or equivalently a triangle
such that no matter at what angle you place copies of it on an integer lattice,
they always cover the plane; my guess is that the worst angle is parallel
and 30 degrees to the lattice, giving a triangle with 2-unit sides
and contradicting an earlier answer to Asimov's question.
