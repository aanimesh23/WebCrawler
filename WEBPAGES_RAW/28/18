<td width ="80%">
This "programming assignment" is designed to ensure that you know how to
  use -at least in a cookbook way-
  <b>CLion</b> (for editing,building,  running, and debugging C++ programs,
    after installing the course library),
 <b>GoogleTest</b> (and driver programs, for testing and locating errors in
    code), and <b>Checkmate</b> for submitting programs for grading.
<p>
You will start this programming assignment similarly to others this quarter.
<ul>
<li>First you will download and unzip the <b>CLion Project Folder</b>
      named <b>program0</b>.
<p>
<li>Second you will move the <b>program0</b> folder into your
      <b>ClionProjects</b> folder (created when you installed and tested
      the <a href="../../../common/handouts/cygwinclion/clion.html" target ="_new">CLion</a>
      IDE: see Section 3, Step 1a).
<p>
<li>Third, you will individually uncomment (only one <b>.cpp</b> file can be
     uncommented at a time), build (compile and link), and run the
     <b>driver.cpp</b> program and then the <b>test_queue.cpp</b> program that
     are in the <b>project0</b> folder: my code deliberately has an error that
     you will find and fix.
<p>
<li>Fourth, when you have corrected the program, you will submit its
      <b>.hpp</b> file for grading using the <b>Checkmate</b> submission system.
</ul>
For all later assignments, I will not be providing as much code as I do in
  this assignment, because the focus of this assignment is using tools,
  not writing code; the focus of the later assignments is writing code
 using the tools that you will learn in this assignment.
<b>But</b> that assumes that you learn how to use these tools now.
There is actually just one error in this code, and this write-up will
  detail where it is and how to fix it.
So the purpose of this assignment is not to fix the error, but instead to become
  familiar with the tools that you will use throughout the quarter to find and
  fix errors in your own code.
<p>
You may want to print this document and carefully read it, marking any parts
  that contain important information (for review, before you submit the file);
  you might want to save the copy you marked-up.
Please report any major problems on the <b>Programming Assignments</b> message
  board (and any minor problems, like typos, to me).
I expect you to read this entire document and perform all the operations it
  describes...maybe even more than once to better learn the tools covered
  before your first real programming assignment.

<td width ="20%"><b>Download, Unzip, and<br>
                    Move the Project Folder</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
In this section you will download, unzip, and move a project folder into
  the <b>ClionProjects</b> folder (created when you installed and tested CLion).
<ol>
<li>Download (onto your desktop) and unzip the following 
      <a href="program0.zip">CLion Start Project Folder</a>.
    Generally if you right-click the <b>.zip</b> file, one of
      the options available will unzip the file: <b>Izarc</b>
      and <b>WinZip</b> are two common programs, both further
     specify an <b>Extract [to] Here</b> option.
    If you have any problems ask one of the staff for help.
<p>

    The resulting unzipped folder contains the <b>.hpp</b> and <b>.cpp</b> files
      that comprise this programming project, along with its
      <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> make file, and an input <b>.txt</b> file.
    The <b>program0</b> folder contains 6 files:
  <ul>
  <li>The <b>linear_array_queue.hpp</b> file implements a queue data type
       using an array (but with one bug).
  <li>The <b>driver.cpp</b> and <b>driver_queue.hpp</b> files test drives
        the <b>LinearArrayQueue</b>.
  <li>The <b>test_queue.cpp</b> file contains a GoogleTest for any
        implementation of a queue.
  <li>The <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file contains a <b>cmake</b> file from which
        CLion automatically builds a <b>make</b> file when we load this project.
  <li>The <b>loadq.txt</b> input file contains a few values that are loadable
        by the <b>lf</b> command in the driver.
  </ul>
<p>
The <b>linear_array_queue</b> file in this project defines an almost correct
  <b>LinearArrayQueue</b> class that implements the behavior of a queue data
  type: it is a simpler to understand but less efficient version of the
  <b>ArrayQueue</b> class supplied in the <b>courselib</b>.
A queue is a simple FIFO data type, adhering to the First-in First-out ordering
  property.
Queues enqueue values to their rear and dequeue values from their front, so
  these are the two "hot spots" that must be efficiently accessed in any data
  structure that implements a queue.
You will be implementing lots of (abstract) data types, like this one, during
  the quarter.
<p>
We can implement the queue data type efficiently by using either an array or
  a linked list data structure.
The queue type implementation in this programming assignment,
  <b>LinearArrayQueue</b>, declares the required instance variables and needed
  methods using an array data structure: the front of the queue is always
  stored at index 0; the rear is stored at a higher index in the array.
Using a linear array is conceptually simple to understand and program,
  but it has a slower-than-necessary <b>dequeue</b> operation (when compared
  with using a circular array data structure used in the <b>ArrayQueue</b>
  class, which we will discuss in the course): it always requires looping
  through an array, copying each element to its previous index.
When all the necessary libraries are installed, this class compiles and can
  be tested in the driver and via GoogleTest; but the code is not correct, so
  it results in a few execution/run-time errors.
<p>
  In the <b>driver_queue.hpp</b> and <b>test_queue.hpp</b> files, the two lines
    <b><pre>  #include "linear_array_queue.hpp"
    typedef ics::LinearArrayQueue&lt;std::string&gt; QueueType;</b></pre>
    choose the linear array queue implementation to drive and test.
  The standard <b>ArrayQueue</b> in the <b>courselib</b> uses a more complicated
    but efficient circular array implementation.
<p>
<li>Move the entire <b>program0</b> folder (unzipped above) into the
      <b>ClionProjects</b> folder (created when you installed and tested CLion).
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Mac users must always <b>remove the following two lines</b>
    from the CMakeLists.txt file they download:
<b><pre>set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "/cygdrive/c/cygwin64/bin/clang++")
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER "/cygdrive/c/cygwin64/bin/clang")</pre></b>
These lines are necessary for PC (not Mac) implementations; always perform this
  step after you download a project if you are on a Mac.

<td width ="80%">
Each data type that we will discuss this quarter has a "driver" program that
  allows us to "drive it": to call (test) each of its methods and observe the
  results.
In <b>program0</b>, the driver program appears in the<b>driver_queue.hpp</b>
  file; it is called from the <b>driver.cpp</b> file.
<ol start="7"> 
<li>Uncomment lines 1-6 in the <b>driver.cpp</b> file.
<p>

<li>Click the
    <img src="../../../common/handouts/cygwinclion/images/clion/runicon.jpg">
     (Run icon) on this window.
    <p>
    The following <b>CLion</b>
      project window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/run.jpg">
    <p>

<p>
The Rune pane will display the queue being manipulated (now empty)
 and the following menu of options that you can use to call/test each queue
 method.
<p>
Note that this driver tests a queue that stores <b>std::string</b> values.
You must enter a string to test any Mutator (Command) or Accessor (Query)
  method.
Of special note is the <b>it</b> command, which constructs and tests an explicit
  iterator for this queue: it has its own submenu of options applicable
  to iterators (which are the same for every data type).
<p>
Note that the queue being manipulated prints before the menu using its
  <b>.str()</b> query, that starts with the data type (here <b>queue</b>)
  followed by the enqueued values in brackets (separated by commas).
Afterwards are all the data members in the implementing class and their values.
In an <b>LinearArrayQueue</b> these data members are...
<ul>
  <li>...<b>length</b>: the physical length of its array.
  <li>...<b>used</b>: the number of array indexes containing values
        (always <= <b>length</b>).
  <li>...<b>mod_count</b>: counts the number of modifications made to the
        queue since its construction.
</ul>
<p>
The <b>&lt;</b> command shows the data type view: just <b>queue[]:rear</b>
  for an empty queue, which shows the data type view of the the queue; whereas
  the <b>.str()</b> call (shown above the menu) produces more detailed
  information about the implementation, which is often useful for debugging the
  implementation.
<p>

<li>
Issue the <b>m</b>, <b>s</b>, and <b>p</b> commands to query the state of
  the empty queue.
The Run pane should show the following.
<p>
<img src="images/runmsp.jpg"></img>
<p>
The <b>peek</b> method returns a reference to the queue's first value (which
  the driver prints); but it cannot work correctly on an empty queue.
Notice what is printed instead: the thrown exception
  (<b>EmptyError</b>) and the <b>Class::method</b> that raised the error.
Thus, the driver just ignores this command and we can continue driving the
  other methods in the <b>LinearArrayQueue</b> class.
<p>

<li>
Next issue the <b>e</b> command and enqueue <b>test1</b> when prompted.
This method returns the number of values enqueued to the queue
  (for queues, which can contain duplicate values, it always returns
  <b>1</b>; for sets, which cannot contain duplicate values, this method
  may return <b>0</b> if the value is already in the set).
The queue now prints (using <b>.str()</b>, before the next menu) as
<b><pre>queue q = LinearArrayQueue[0:test1](length=1,used=1,mod_count=1)</pre></b>
which shows...
<ul>
  <li>...the queue now contains at index 0 the value <b>test1</b>.
  <li>...the length of the array holding the queue values has increased to
        <b>1</b>.
  <li>...the queue is using <b>1</b> value in the array.
  <li>...the queue has been mutated <b>1</b> time since being constructed:
        the previous accessors/queries are not counted because they do not
        change the queue.
</ul>
<p>

<li>
Next issue the <b>e</b> command again and enqueue <b>test2</b> when prompted.
The queue now prints (before the next menu) as
<b><pre>queue q = LinearArrayQueue[0:test1,1:test2](length=2,used=2,mod_count=2)</pre></b>
Order is important in queues: the earlier a value is enqueued, the earlier it
  appears in the array.
Notice that both <b>length</b> and <b>used</b> increase to <b>2</b>.
<p>
Next issue the <b>e</b> command again and enqueue <b>test3</b> when prompted.
The queue now prints (before the next menu) as
<b><pre>queue q = LinearArrayQueue[0:test1,1:test2,2:test3,3:](length=4,used=3,mod_count=3)</pre></b>
Notice that <b>length</b> increases to <b>4</b> while <b>used</b> and
  <b>mod_count</b> both increase to <b>3</b>: generally if there is not enough
  room in an array, its length is <b>doubled</b>, not just
  <b>incremented by 1</b>: we will discuss why later in the quarter, when we
  analyze the running time of performing <b>N</b> enqueues.
The Run pane should show the following.
<p>
<p>
<img src="images/runeee.jpg"></img>
<p>

<li>
Next issue the <b>d</b> command which should dequeue the value at the front of
  the queue.
It correctly prints <b>dequeue = test1</b>, but when it prints the queue
  before the next menu, it appears as
<b><pre>queue q = LinearArrayQueue[0:test2,1:test3,2:test3,3:](length=4,used=3,mod_count=4)</pre></b>
This result is <b>incorrect</b> because (a) <b>used</b> is still <b>3</b>.
It is OK that <b>test3</b> now appears in two different queue/array locations
  (it was shifted one to the left, but still appears at the end).
If <b>used</b> were <b>2</b>, index <b>2</b> would not be considered to be in
  the queue (the two used indexes are <b>0</b> and <b>1</b>).
In fact, if you issue the <b>&lt;&lt;</b> command it will show as
<b>queue[test2,test3,test3]:rear</b>, indicating (incorrectly) that <b>test3</b>
  appears in the queue twice.
<p>
If you issue the <b>d</b> command again, it correctly prints
  <b>dequeue = test2</b> but <b>used</b> remains <b>3</b> and now <b>test3</b>
  appears in all three positions in the array.
In fact, if you issue the <b>&lt;&lt;</b> command it will show as
<b>queue[test3,test3,test3]:rear</b>, indicating (incorrectly) that <b>test3</b>
  appears in the queue three times.
<p>
If you issue the <b>d</b> command again, it correctly prints
  <b>dequeue = test3</b> but <b>used</b> remains <b>3</b>.
<p>
Notice that <b>mod_count</b> (correctly) increases from <b>3</b>, to <b>4</b>,
  to <b>5</b>, and finally to <b>6</b>, because each three <b>dequeue</b>
  modifies the queue.
<p>
Next issue the <b>s</b> command, and the driver prints <b>3</b>: although we
  have dequeued all three values, because of the error the queue thinks its
  size is still <b>3</b>.
<p>
Next issue the <b>x</b> command (whose <b>clear</b> method is <b>void</b> and
  returns -and the driver prints- no result).
It will correctly clear the queue, which prints before the final menu as
<b><pre>queue q = LinearArrayQueue[0:test3,1:test3,2:test3,3:](length=4,used=0,mod_count=7)</pre></b>
Notice that <b>mod_count</b> (correctly) increases to <b>7</b>, because
  <b>clear</b> modifies the queue.
Also notice that <b>used</b> is now <b>0</b>.
In fact, if you issue the <b>&lt;&lt;</b> command it will show as
<b>queue[]:rear</b>, indicating (correctly) that there are no values in the
  queue.
<p>
The Run pane should show the following.
<p>
<img src="images/rundddsx.jpg"></img>
<p>
So, using this driver, we can call/test all the methods in the
  <b>LinearArrayQueue</b> class, looking for incorrect behavior.
<p>
If we see errors in the output, to help us debug any errors that we find we 
  can...
<ul>
  <li>...add code in the driver (to print intermediate results) and rerun it.
  <li>...add code in the <b>LinearArrayQueue</b> (to print intermediate results)
          and rerun the driver.
  <li>...use the debugger to set breakpoints in our methods and execute/step
       through the code while observing how it changes its state 
</ul>
<p>
A later section of this document illustrates using the driver with the debugger.
For now, continue to explore and experiment with the other commands in this
 driver, and <b>DO NOT</b> fix the error in <b>delete</b> yet.
The <b>lf</b> command allows quickly enqueuing a series of values read from
  a file (the default it <b>loadq.txt</b>, which is included with this project).
Try the <b>it</b> commands to better understand what we can do with iterators
  (especially how to erase selected values inside the queue).
<p>
If you ever find your program in an <b>infinite loop</b>, you can terminate the
  program manually by clicking the 
  <img src="../../../common/handouts/cygwinclion/images/clion/stopicon.jpg">
  (Stop icon) on the left of the <b>Run</b> pane.
After terminating the driver, click the
  <img src="../../../common/handouts/cygwinclion/images/clion/closeicon.jpg">
  (Close icon) on the left of the <b>Run</b> pane to close/remove the Run pane.
<p>
To rerun the driver after editing any of these files, click the
  <img src="../../../common/handouts/cygwinclion/images/clion/runicon.jpg">
  (Run icon).
When CLion re-<b>builds</b> a project it re-<b>compiles</b> all changed files
  and re-<b>links</b> them into an executable (<b>.exe</b>) file.

<td width ="80%">
Each data type that we will discuss this quarter also has a GoogleTest for
  testing its implementation(s).
While a driver for a class is code that allows us to manually test its methods
  and observe their results, a GoogleTest is code that automatically tests the
  class and report its results.
It produces output to show clearly which tests passed and which tests failed;
  and for the failed tests, it produces more detailed information about how the
  test failed.
When the code is modified (and hopefully corrected), it is very easy to rerun
  all the tests automatically and observe the changes (hopefully more/all tests
  are now passing).
<p>
To run the GoogleTest program...
<ol start="13">
<li>Recomment lines 1-6 in the <b>driver.cpp</b> file (because we do not
      want to run the driver)</b>.
    <p>
    Recall that only one uncommented <b>main</b> function can exist in a C++
      project, because there can be only one starting point for the program
      being run; so we will comment this code and uncomment the code in the
      <b>test_queue.cpp</b> file.
<p>

<li>Uncomment all the code in the <b>test_queue.cpp</b> file.
  <ol>
  <li>Double-click the <b>test_queue.cpp</b> file that appears in the 
        Project pane.
  <li>Click inside the <b>test_queue.cpp</b> Editor pane to activate editing.
  <li>Type the <b>ctrl-a</b> command (<b>command-a</b> on Macs)

  <li>Type the <b>ctrl-/</b> command (<b>command-a</b> on Macs)
        to toggle the commenting on the selected lines (uncomment them).
  </ol>
<p>
Before running this project, examine the code in the <b>test_queue.cpp</b> file.
It consists of 12 separate tests, each which should be readable and
  understandable if you understand what queues are about.
The actual GoogleTest for implementations of Queue data types is longer; but we
  use a smaller/simpler file for Programming Assignment #0.
<p>

<li>Click the
    <img src="../../../common/handouts/cygwinclion/images/clion/runicon.jpg">
     (Run icon) on this window to run the Googletest.
    <p>
    The Run pane should show the following.
    <p>
    <img src="images/googletest.jpg">
    <p>
Check the bottom of GoogleTest's output first
It summarizes the number of passed tests and names the failed tests: you can
  examine these failed tests in more detail, if they are present.
<p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">
<p>
<h3>Failure Modes</h3>
<p>
There are two major failure modes detectable in each GoogleTest.
<ul>
  <li>An assertion failure in a test means that the code being tested did not
        meet its requirements.
      GoogleTest will print useful information about the failure (just what it
        prints is based on what kind of assertion failed).
      In the figure above, both the <b>dequeue1</b> and <b>dequeue2</b> tests
        failed (on lines 221 and 232 respectively); the assertions concerned
        truth values for calling the <b>q.empty()</b> and <b>q.size()</b>
        methods, whose different <b>Actual</b> and <b>Expected</b> values are
        shown.
  <p>
  <li>An exception failure in a test means that the code being tested threw an
       exception.
      GoogleTest will print information about the exception (although often
        it just states an unexpected exception was thrown..
      In the figure above, no unexpected exceptions were thrown.
      If one was, it might look as follows:
      <p>
      <img src="images/exception.jpg"></img>
      <p>
      
  <p>
</ul>
<p>
In both cases, the GoogleTest records the failure and then continues with
  subsequent tests.
<p>
In addition, there are two failure modes <b>NOT</b> nicely
  detectable/reportable in a GoogleTest.
<ul>
  <li>An <b>infinite loop</b>: In such a case GoogleTest will stop printing
         information in the Run pane after starting to run a test.
     If the <b>enqueue</b> test caused an infinite loop, the Rune pane might
       look as follows.
     In such a case, you would have to manually stop the program.
<p>
<img src="images/infinite.jpg"></img>
<p>
If you ever find your program in an <b>infinite loop</b>, you can terminate the
  program manually by clicking the 
  <img src="../../../common/handouts/cygwinclion/images/clion/stopicon.jpg">
  (Stop icon) on the left of the <b>Run</b> pane.
After terminating the program, click the
  <img src="../../../common/handouts/cygwinclion/images/clion/closeicon.jpg">
  (Close icon) on the left of the <b>Run</b> pane to close/remove the Run pane.
<p>
By these actions, the GoogleTest will stop and not be performed on subsequent
  tests.
<p>

<li>Certain kinds of executions errors (e.g., accessing illegal memory).
In these cases, the program will stop executing the GoogleTest.
<p>
<img src="images/runtimeerror.jpg"></img>
<p>
Note here that in the middle of RUNing the <b>QueueTest.enqueu</b>, the
  program terminates.
</ul>
<p>

<p>
When either of these kinds of errors occur, you have a choice of either
<ul>
  <li>commenting-out this test code running when the error occurred
        (so GoogleTest won't run this test, but will run subsequent tests)
  <li>keeping this test and immediately debugging the code that is causing it
        to fail.
</ul>
<p>
If you choose the first approach, remember to uncomment the test code
  eventually to ensure that your code is passing all the GoogleTests,
  including this one.
<p>

<h3>Debugging Strategies</h3>
<p>
Here is a short but <b>important</b> list of four stategies that we can employ
  when our code fails, to try to understand the cause of the problem (and then
  hopefully correct it).
First, examine the line of code in the test at which the failure was detected
  (which is printed in the Run pane) and the information it displays related to
  the failure.
<ol>
  <li>Seaching the code for a mistake using the failure information as a guide.
  <p>
  <li>Add arbitrary C++ code in the GoogleTest to print useful information
        right before the failure line.
  <p>
  <li>Use the debugger to set a breakpoint on the line with the failed
        assertion (the debugger stops <b>before</b> executing the breakpointed
        line) and then examine any relevant state.
  <p>
  <li>Use the driver (or any tiny program you write) to duplicate/explore the
         problem manually.
</ol>
<p>
<h3>GoogleTests</h3>
<p>
Generally, each public method has its own GoogleTest, reflecting the
  semantics (meaning) of what that method does in the class (sometimes needing
  to call other methods too).
It is good to be able to read and understand the GoogleTest code (and you will
  get more experience doing so during the quarter) because it can be useful to
  add debugging code to it: typically printing the state of variables just
  before a test/assertion failed.
Mostly GoogleTest code intersperses calls to the methods of the class being
  tested with assertions about what the results of those method-calls should
  be: a test method fails when any assertions in it fail.
<p>
The tests are peformed in the order in which they appear.
I try to arrange my tests from the simple to the more complex.
Sometimes bugs that cause failures in the earlier tests also cause failures in
  later test.
So an important debugging strategy is to concentrate on -and correct- the
  earlier bugs: at best the later bugs might automatically disappear; at worst
  it will be easier to understand/correct the later/more complicated bugs after
  you have understood/corrected the earlier/simpler ones.
<p>
Also note that each test is abandoned when the first assertion fails; it 
  doesn't test subsequent assertions <b>in that test method</b>
  (but GoogleTest will still attempt to do all <b>subsequent</b> test methods
  after any detectable failure).
This strategy leads to two interesting consequences
<ul>
  <li>The output is not cluttered with multiple failure messages for
        multiple assertions in each test: instead each test either passes or
        fails; and if it fails, it presents details about only the first
        failure.
  <p>
  <li>Expect that a test might still fail after you make corrections to your
        code.
      But, the correction should cause a failure later in that test:
        e.g., an earlier assertion in the test that failed should now pass,
        even if a later assertion (which was not reached because of the earlier
        failure) now is tested and fails.
</ul>
Plan on eliminating bugs/failures one at a time, until none are present.
<p>
<h3>Debugging Strategy Examples</h3>
<p>
Here we will examine the four strategies for debugging stated above.
The first failure was on line 221 in the <b>dequeue1</b> test.
The entire test appears as follows, with its line numbers.
<b><pre>  213 TEST_F(QueueTest, dequeue1) {
  214   QueueType q;
  215   load(q,"abcde");
  216   ASSERT_EQ("a",q.dequeue());
  217   ASSERT_EQ("b",q.dequeue());
  218   ASSERT_EQ("c",q.dequeue());
  219   ASSERT_EQ("d",q.dequeue());
  220   ASSERT_EQ("e",q.dequeue());
  221   ASSERT_TRUE(q.empty());
  222   ASSERT_EQ(0, q.size());
  223   ASSERT_THROW(q.peek(),ics::EmptyError);
  224 }</pre></b>
<p>
The error states that the queue was expected to be empty but it was not.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Our first stategy would be just to look at the code in the
      <b>LinearArrayQueue</b/b> class.
    We will see that the the <b>empty</b> method returns <b>false</b> when
      <b>used</b> is not <b>0</b>.
    We will also see that <b>used</b> is initialized to <b>0</b>, and if we
      enqueue five values (what <b>load(q,"abcde");</b> does)
      and then dequeue five values it should return to  <b>0</b>.
    Since the <b>enqueue</b> test worked, we can focus on the <b>dequeue</b>
       method to learn why <b>used</b> was not decremented to <b>0</b>.
<p>

<li>Our second stategy would be to add some code in the <b>dequeue1</b> test to
      help us understand why the <b>empty</b> method returns <b>false</b>.
    We could, for example, print the size and even the queue itself (using the
      more verbose <b>.str()</b> function), using the  following code.
    <b><pre>std::cout << "in deqeue1: size = " << q.size() << ", queue = " << q.str() << std::endl;</pre></b>
    I highly recommend putting textual material in these debugging displays, to
      identify them: as we put more and more debugging displays into a program
      (which we typically do when debugging) they can become confusing.
    If we put this code right before the line 221 it would display
    <b><pre>in deqeue1: size = 5, queue = queue[e,e,e,e,e]:rear(length=8,used=5,mod_count=10)</pre></b>
    The queue is supposed to be empty, but its <b>used</b> is <b>5</b>.
    It might be useful to put this statement after the call to
    <b>load</b> and after each call to <b>dequeue()</b> to observe how
    <b>used</b> changes (in fact, it doesn't).
    Doing so would produce the following ouput.
<b><pre>
in deqeue1: size = 5, queue = queue[a,b,c,d,e]:rear(length=8,used=5,mod_count=5)
in deqeue1: size = 5, queue = queue[b,c,d,e,e]:rear(length=8,used=5,mod_count=6)
in deqeue1: size = 5, queue = queue[c,d,e,e,e]:rear(length=8,used=5,mod_count=7)
in deqeue1: size = 5, queue = queue[d,e,e,e,e]:rear(length=8,used=5,mod_count=8)
in deqeue1: size = 5, queue = queue[e,e,e,e,e]:rear(length=8,used=5,mod_count=9)
in deqeue1: size = 5, queue = queue[e,e,e,e,e]:rear(length=8,used=5,mod_count=10)</pre></b>

<li>Our third strategy is to use the debugger to set a breakpoint before the
      failed assertion, and then examine relevant state.
    The debugger in CLion/C++ (GDB) operates similarly to the Eclipse/Python.
    We can set unconditional and conditional breakpoints, single step (into,
      over, and out of) code, observe the values of global and local variables.
    Experiment with the debugger until you know how to use it to perform common
      debugging tasks (like those indicated below).
    <p>
    Try these steps.
    <ul>
       <li>Double-click the <b>linear_array_queue.hpp</b> file in the Project
             pane to edit it.
       <p>
       <li>Set an unconditional breakpoint on line 222 (the <b>++mod_count;</b>
             statement in the <b>dequeue</B> method); recall that when a line
             has a breakpoint, execution stops <b>before</b> the line is
             executed.
       <p>
       <img src="images/breakpoint.jpg"></img>
       <p>

       <li>Launch the debugger by clicking the bug icon 
             <img src="images/debugicon.jpg"></img>.
           <p>
           This rebuilds and starts running the <b>test_queue</b> program,
             which stops the first time it reaches line 222.
           When debugging, the Run pane appears in a pop-window.
           <p>
           <img src="images/debugrunpane.jpg"></img>
           <p>
           And the CLion window shows debugging information (mostly in the
             Debug pane).
           <p>
           <img src="images/debug.jpg"></img>
           <p>
           Here I have disclosed the object pointed to by <b>this</b> in the
             Variables pane).
           <ul>
           <li>The code on Line 222 in the
                 <b>linear_array_queue.hpp</b> pane is highlighted in blue,
                 indicating this line is about to be executed.
           <li>Underneath <b>Thread-1</b> shows execution starts in the
                 <b>main</b> function in the <b>test_queue.cpp</b> file
                 (at line 301).
                 and goes through a variety of function calls until it reaches
                 the <b>dequeue</b> function in the
                 <b>linear_array_queue.cpp</b> file (at line 222).
                 This is the function call stack, with the top of the stack
                   highlighting in blue the function currently executing.
           <li>The <b>Variables</b> pane shows the object <b>this</b> refers to
                 and object whose <b>length</b> member is equal to <b>8</b>,
                 whose <b>used</b> member is equal to <b>5</b>, and whose
                 <b>mod_count</b> member is equal to <b>5</b>.
           </ul>

       <li>Execute the current line (222), by clicking the
             <img src="images/stepovericon.jpg"></img>,(Step over icon).
           The result is
           <p>
           <img src="images/stepover.jpg"></img>.
           <p>
           <ul>
           <li>The code on Line 223 in the
                 <b>linear_array_queue.hpp</b> pane is highlighted in blue,
                 indicating this line is about to be executed.
           <li>Underneath <b>Thread-1</b> shows the top of the stack as
                 executing the <b>dequeue</b> function in the
                 <b>linear_array_queue.cpp</b> file (at line 223).
           <li>The <b>Variables</b> pane shows the the <b>mod_count</b> member
                 as changed (it appears in blue) to the value <b>6</b>.
           </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
    I'm hoping that you have had some experience with debuggers in your
      prior programming classes.
      
<p>

<li>Our fourth strategy would be to use the driver to duplicate/explore the
      problem manually.
    Actually, in our discussion of the driver we saw that when we enqueued
      three values and dequeued all three, the result was a queue whose
      <b>used</b> was still <b>3</b>, with the last enqueued values stored in
      all indexes.
    Recall that to re-run the driver, we would have to uncomment its code,
      after commenting-out all the code in the GoogleTest, and then re-run
      the project code.
</ol>
<p>

In fact, both test failures relate to a single bug: the <b>used</b> variable
  was not decremented in the <b>dequeue</b> method: I commented-out the code
  at line 221 of the <b>linear_array_queue.hpp</b> file.
Remember that sometimes fixing one bug will cause many failed tests to pass.
<p>
Restore this line of code (uncomment it) to fix the error.
Now rerun this GoogleTest and verify that there are no more failures.
The bottom of the Run pane should show
<p>
<img src="images/passingall.jpg"></img>.
<p>
Originally, both errors and failures indicated that the code is incorrect and
  should be fixed.
Of course, we must be careful because it is possible that an assertion is
  incorrect: e.g., an assertion asserts the size of the queue is some number
  but based on the <b>enqueue</b>/<b>dequeue</b> methods called in the
  GoogleTest it should be some other number.
While you should mostly believe the GoogleTests I distribute, there is always
  the possibility that I have made a mistake.
If you look closely at a GoogleTest and don't understand why some failing
  assertion should be true, please contact me or one of the staff to help
  resolve the problem.
