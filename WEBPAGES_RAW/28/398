<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">"Luck, Be a Lady Tonight"</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">This assignment is due at the end of lab on
Wednesday, January 25.  This is enough time for a novice Python programmer to
complete the task, bearing in mind that Informatics 42 is a six-unit course
that typically will require work outside of the normally scheduled lab hours.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">You will also notice that the specifications
for most assignments in this course are longer than we&#39;ve seen before.
 This is a good thing:  the more explanation we give, the more guidance
you have.  But technical specifications are not like novels.  You cannot
speed-read through them just one time and expect to gain the information
you need.  Plan to read the specifications carefully, and plan to go back
and read them again to pick up additional details.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">We expect you to complete this assignment in
pairs, following the usual <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/pair.html">pair programming guidelines</A>.
 You may not choose
this project as your one &quot;pair programming holiday&quot; this quarter.
 There are lots of little details to get through, and it&#39;s really hard
to do it alone.  We suggest that you try to pick a partner whose experience
level is relatively close to your own; that seems to optimize both the effectiveness
and the efficiency of both partners&#39; learning (i.e., you&#39;ll learn
more with less effort).</FONT></P>
<P>
<B>Problem synopsis:</B> 
Write a program to play the dice game "craps," including playing
against the computer, compiling statistics on the fairness of the
dice, and handling bets.</P>
<p>
This assignment is divided into four stages. Each succeeding stage is built upon what you have already written for the previous stage. We expect you to design, write, and test this program according to these stages—first get the first-stage program working, then modify it to satisfy the second stage, and so on.
</p>
<p>
You should make sure that each stage is entirely correct and working perfectly before you go on to the next. As you complete each stage, you must demonstrate briefly to your TA or tutor that it works correctly before you go on to the following stage. If you try to add the second-stage features before your first stage is debugged, you'll just have twice as large a program to search through for errors. In fact, breaking up the problem into several subprograms will speed up your coding, aid you in debugging, and keep you from getting too far off on the wrong track.
Sometimes students think, "Yes, this business about stages would be a
nice idea if I had the time, but it'll take me too long." This is
wrong. What will take you the most time (and thus cause you the most
frustration and unhappiness) is trying to debug the whole program at
once. If it seems longer to do it by stages, it's only because each
stage is a nicely manageable piece that's not too taxing by itself.
</p>
<p>
You will find that this program focuses mostly on control
structures—how to get the right things to happen in the right
order, including managing interactions with the user.  
These are skills you need to program in languages like Python.
But you won't find that object-oriented design, model-view-controller
organization, or even unit testing will help you all that much.  You
should certainly try to isolate separate functionality (like rolling
two dice and returning the result) into separate functions, but the
interactive nature of the program and the randomness of the dice will
lead you simply to run interactive tests as frequently as you can.
</p>
<p>
<b>Grading:</b> Your score will depend primarily on correctness and on adherence to
the specifications (which is essentially the same thing).  It is
always far better to implement a subset of the functionality correctly
than to attempt to implement more features in a program that retains
some bugs.  Secondary aspects of your score will include contract
and purpose information where appropriate, reasonable adherence to
Python coding conventions and idioms, and avoidance of grossly clumsy
or stylistically poor code.
</p>
<p><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">In assignments for this class, code that doesn&#39;t
compile correctly will receive very little credit, no matter how long or
how hard you worked on it.  If it doesn&#39;t compile, there&#39;s no real
way to tell what it does or doesn&#39;t do.</FONT></p>
<p>
  <strong>Statement of the problem:</strong> 
  The operators of the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York have decided to computerize their racket, figuring that since a computer can shoot craps faster than a human, more games can be played, so more money can be made. Sky Masterson has fingered you to write the program.
</p><p>
Craps is a game played with two six-sided dice; each die's faces are
numbered from 1 to 6. The player (or "shooter") rolls the dice. The shooter wins
right away If the total of the two faces is a "natural" (7 or 11).
If it is "craps" (2, 3, or 12), the shooter loses. 
Anything else becomes the shooter's "point". The shooter then keeps on
rolling until either winning by 
"making the point" (i.e., rolling that number again) or losing by
"crapping out" (rolling a 7). (The rolls 2, 3, 11, and 12 have no
special meaning when the shooter is trying to make the point.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Stage I:</strong>
 In this stage you will write an interactive program to play a single
 game of craps. When you complete this stage, it should produce sample
 sessions like the following:</p>
<pre><code>Welcome to Sky Masterson's Craps Game 

Roll is  7
Natural; shooter wins
Thank you for playing</code></pre>
Another possible session is:
<pre><code>Welcome to Sky Masterson's Craps Game 

Roll is  6
The point is 6
Roll is  12
Roll is  12
Roll is  4
Roll is  10
Roll is  7
Crapped out; shooter loses
Thank you for playing</code></pre>

<p>Use your reference materials (the online Python documentation or the textbook) to find out how to generate random numbers.  Often we'll just tell you specific details like this, but you do need the experience of looking things up yourself and this is an easy thing to find. (But if it takes you more than ten minutes, ask someone rather than spending more time on it.)</p>
<p><b>Stage II:</b> 
  [Make your enhancements for this stage on a separate copy of your
  Stage I program.  Don't modify your only copy.]
</p><p>
For this stage, modify your program so that it plays a succession of
games, continuing until the player asks to quit, and alternating games
played between the human player and the computer. That is, after the
human player plays a single game (as described in Stage I), the
computer will roll dice for a game. Then, your program should ask the
player if he would like to play another round. If the answer is yes,
then the whole process is repeated. If not, the program prints its
final message and halts, as before.
</p><p>
A sample session for this stage follows;
the user's input is shown in <code><strong>bold face</strong></code>.
<pre><code>Welcome to Sky Masterson's Craps Game 

Your game:
Roll is  7

Computer's game:
Roll is  3

Would you like to play again? (y or n):  <b>y</b>
Your game:

Would you like to play again? (y or n):  <b>n</b>
Thank you for playing</code></pre>
<p><b>Stage III:</b>
Sky doesn't trust you completely, though; he's afraid you might make
the game crooked so a pal of yours can beat the odds. In this stage
you will demonstrate that the dice aren't loaded (i.e., that the roll
function is pretty random). Modify your program so that it keeps track
of the number of times each possible total (2 through 12) comes up
during the entire session.
</p><p>
 After the player decides to stop playing,
continue rolling silently until you have exactly 2000 rolls. Then plot
the results in histogram form, showing how frequently each possible
two-dice total (2 through 12) came up.  Your results might look like
this:
<pre><code>Welcome to Sky Masterson's Craps Game

Your game:
Roll is  2
Craps; shooter loses

Computer's game:
Roll is  10
The point is 10
Roll is  5
Roll is  10
Made the point; shooter wins

Would you like to play again? (y or n):  <b>n</b>

12:    66 ( 3%)  ***</code></pre>
<p><b>Stage IV:</b>
We expect that every pair will be able to complete this final stage;
similar students in similar classes in the past have done it (singly).  
But if your pair runs into unusual difficulty on this stage, you
should know that you can get a reasonable score on the assignment
without it (assuming that what you do turn in is entirely correct).
</p><p>
In this stage you will add betting to the game. Initially, the player
and the computer are both given $500. The program will play a series
of games, alternating turns between the human player and the computer,
just as in Stage II. The program ends either when the player doesn't
want to play any more (as before) or when the player runs out of money
(goes broke). When play is over, the program will print betting
statistics (described below) before printing its final message and
ending.
</p><p>
The computer, unlike the human player, has infinite credit; its funds can go below zero without affecting the play. But neither player may make a negative bet.
</p><p>
Before the human player's turn starts, the program asks how much the
player wants to bet.
And if the human player needs to roll to make a point, the program
will ask before each roll how much more to add to the current bet.
If the player tries to bet more money than he or she has, the program
will print a message and ask for another amount.
</p><p>
When it is the human player's turn, the computer will simply match the
human player's bet.
</p>
<p>
When it is the computer's turn, the computer will bet half of its
current funds or $75, whichever is lower. But if the computer is in
debt or broke, it will bet $15. The amount of the computer's bet is
displayed, and the player will be asked to make a bet. The most the
player can bet is the amount the computer bet or the amount the player
has, whichever is lower. If the player attempts to bet more than he or
she has, handle it as above. If the player bets more than the computer
bet, the program lowers the player's bet to match. If the player bets
less than the computer, the computer will reduce its bet to match the
player's bet. After these initial bets, no other betting occurs during
the computer's turn.
</p>
<p>
Finally, your program should also keep track of some statistics and
print them out at the end of the entire session. Keep track of how
much each player (human and computer) has bet and has won, and how
much they have left at the end. Also, keep track of the smallest and
largest pot of the game and the average pot size.
</p><p>

<P>
  <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>How to get started:</B>  Read the assignment
specification.  Reading it through twice wouldn&#39;t hurt.  </FONT></P>
<P>
  <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">It is absolutely essential that you work in
    very small increments.  After each tiny change, run your code to make sure it behaves correctly.  Novice programmers (and even some experienced
    ones) sometimes fall into this terrible trap:  They add a whole lot of code
    to their program all at once, then they try to run it, and their code doesn&#39;t
    even compile correctly.  The debugging job is enormous at that point, because
    there&#39;s no easy way to tell which part of the code has the error in
    it.  When you add one tiny portion of code at a time, rerunning
    after each addition and not adding more until what you have is correct,
    your overall development time is shorter because you can locate any error
in the small part of code you most recently added. (For a non-computing-related illustration of how it's better to take small, easy steps rather than trying to bite off a lot at once, everyone should read <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/10/071210fa_fact_gawande">Atul Gawande's article</a> about ICU checklists.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Keep adding new functionality, small piece
by small piece, running and testing as you go, until you&#39;ve satisfied
all the requirements in the assignment specification.  When you have a way
to approach a task, it&#39;s less daunting.</FONT></P>
<P>Here's one more hint: As you add functionality, add extra print statements that print out the values of variables that are changing. That way you can see the progress (correct or otherwise) of your computations. Even if you'll remove those statements once you're sure the code works, having them during development is helpful.</P>
<P>
  <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>What to turn in:</B>  Turn in via Checkmate
    one Python source code (.py) file containing all your code for the final version you completed.  If you haven&#39;t registered yourself for
  Checkmate this quarter, do it now; instructions are on the syllabus.  </FONT><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">As usual, each pair should submit just one
solution, with both partners&#39; names clearly listed at the top of each
file.</FONT></P>
<P>
  <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Also as usual, every student must fill out
    a partner evaluation form at eee.uci.edu.  You can get to the partner evaluation for this lab by
    logging in at eee.uci.edu, choosing MyEEE, and selecting Survey.  Your class
    participation score will suffer if you neglect to do this.  We have not
    turned on the Email nagging option for this evaluation; it&#39;s up to you
to remember to do it within a day or so of the due date.</FONT></P>
