     Suppose I have a bunch of sample points from the boundary of a closed
volume in $R^3$.  Suppose in particular that I have been given the Delaunay
triangulation of these boundary points.  I'd like to interpolate a $C^3$
surface through these vertices.  The related surface-interpolation algorithms
I've found seem not to be applicable:  they either assume that the
triangulation is regular (usually of degree six) or that the surface is
monotonic with respect to some plane.
     Does there exist an algorithm to solve this problem?  References to
the literature would be greatly appreciated.
     Thanks,

There are many ways to interpolate from a Delaunay tesselation.  The quickest
is with barycentric coordinates but is only $C^0$.  If you require higher
smoothness then it is a question of data set size - for 100 data or so just
fit a radial basis spline.  If you must deal with subsets, splines will
give discontinuities at subset boundaries.  Sibson's natural neighbour
interpolation -

will provide continuous slopes everywhere but at the data points themselves.
Incorporating estimated gradients will give total continuity.

dimensions, see

&gt;&gt;	A nice general way to make contour maps from a set of _ANY_ points
&gt;&gt;(ie you don't need a regular grid) is to calculate the Delaunay triangulation
&gt;&gt;from your set of points, and then doing the contour map is pretty easy.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;	The Delaunay triangulation will turn your set of points into a 
&gt;&gt;surface composed entirely of triangles; then you merely need to solve the
&gt;&gt;contour map problem for each triangle in the graph, which is fairly straight
&gt;&gt;forward. You could then pass it through a bezier curve routine to smooth out
&gt;&gt;the straight lines, if you liked.
&gt;
&gt;Right, triangulation is almost always a good idea. I'm not so sure about
&gt;the Bezier bit, though. After all, you expect certain things from contours,
&gt;e.g. you wouldn't really like them to intersect, and I don't see how you could
&gt;guarantee that by applying Bezier routines to a given set of (correct)
&gt;piecewise linear contours.

The trouble with countouring methods based on Delaunay triangulations is
that they can `click' (i.e. produce contours with spurious kinks) on
near-degenerate data.  It's better to use natural-neighbour interpolation
(invented by Robin Sibson) on the Voronoi dual of the Delaunay triangulation.
Start with

Sibson, R, and Thompson, G.D. `A seamed Quadratic Element for Contouring' and
follow the reference tree.
