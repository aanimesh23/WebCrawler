<H2> Abstract </H2>

Team-oriented process programming promises to provide significant
support for the planning, directing, and controlling of software
engineering projects.  In this paper we apply process programming to
software engineering teams and show how this can provide powerful new
capabilities for the management of software projects.  We identify key
issues which must be addressed to apply process programming to teams,
and present our vision for team-oriented process programming.
