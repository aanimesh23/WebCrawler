<P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Read the assignment carefully:</B> If an assignment asks for three examples, give three examples, not just one. This seems pretty simple, but you'd be surprised how many people just don't seem to read the assignment carefully. It's a good idea to read the assignment more than once, including one time after you think you've finished the work.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Justifying your arguments and writing clearly:</B> As we have said before, when you evaluate or design an interface, it isn&#39;t
  enough just to state your conclusion (&quot;I think this arrangement is
  confusing&quot; or &quot;I placed the Save button on the right&quot;). 
  You must justify your decisions in terms of the goals, principles, or guidelines
  that we are studying (&quot;This arrangement is confusing because it includes
  unnecessary colors, which Kobsa&#39;s guidelines for general screen layout
  say to avoid&quot; or &quot;I placed the Save button on the right because
  it&#39;s on the right in all the dialog boxes in this system, which follows
  the usability heuristic of maintaining consistency with system conventions&quot;).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>We expect that all your writing in this course
will be clear, concise, and well organized, following the conventions of
standard academic English.  While the occasional misplaced comma or grammatical
misstep will pass beneath our notice, work whose clear expression is obscured
by multiple flaws will receive a lower score.  In HCI terms, the usability
principle of adhering to standards and conventions dictates that your prose
writing follow these norms.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>It&#39;s a good idea to have close at hand
a paperback English dictionary and a writing guide (such as <I>The Anteater Guide to Writing</I> or the <em>Little Penguin Handbook</em>, which are used in lower-division writing courses
at UCI; there are also <a href="http://www.writingcenter.uci.edu/?page_id=94">online resources</a> on the <a href="http://www.writingcenter.uci.edu">UCI Writing Center</a> site).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Assignment submission and illustrations:
 </B>Where possible, we&#39;d prefer that you submit your work completely
in electronic form using Checkmate (</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">checkmate.ics.uci.edu</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>;
see below).  We also encourage you to use illustrations in your work whenever
they make your point effectively.  You should try, where you can, to produce
those illustrations on the computer and incorporate them into your electronic documents.
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>For existing web pages, you can take screen shots; if you don't know how to take a screen shot on whatever system(s) you use and how to paste those images into a document, now's the time to find out. </FONT><font face="AGaramond" size=4>In most cases, producing a snapshot of
an actual existing screen is quicker than sketching the relevant details
by hand, so the screen shot is what you should use.</font></P>
<P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>For newly created designs, we do not expect your illustrations to be of polished, professional quality and we recognize that few  computer-based tools are as quick and convenient
  as a hand-drawn sketch. The best approach to this would be to take a clear photo of your illustration (on your cellphone, for example) and include it in your electronic submission. If you still think a paper submission is necessary, contact us and we'll make arrangements. 
  <!--If all else fails, though, you may also submit drawings on paper (at the location described below) to supplement your electronic submission, without lowering your score.  In those cases, please
also submit an electronic version via Checkmate (with some notation like
&quot;illustration supplied on paper version&quot; where the hand-drawn
illustrations would go). Submit your paper illustrations, clearly marked with your name, in the Technology Garden, Bren Hall 5054; there is an Informatics 131 folder on the bulletin board. But be sure to keep a copy as a backup, since that room is not secured; if we don't receive your paper submission, we'll expect to to be able to produce a replacement without delay. --></FONT></P>
<!-- <P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>If you plan to submit an assignment on paper,
either deliver it to the TA in section or submit it by the deadline to the
ICS Distribution Center (whose hours are available at <A NAME="_14_2982"></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/academics/sao/distribution/">http://www.ics.uci.edu/academics/sao/distribution/</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>).

<P>
  <FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><b>Working in groups:</b> Some of our assignments will be done in groups of two or more. </FONT></P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
<ul>
  <li>Why not individually? Because you learn more when you discuss the problems and the possible solutions. Also because you won't feel as isolated or 
  frustrated if you don't understand something: Either your partner will know the answer, so you can keep going, or else you'll know you're not alone in 
  not knowing, so you won't feel embarrassed about sending Email questions or posting to Piazzza.com.</li>
  <li>Why not groups of three or more? With two people, both must be engaged; one person talks, the other listens (and we hope they switch roles frequently). 
  A third or fourth person can stop paying attention without bringing everything to a halt, and that's not good. (On the other hand, some tasks take more than 
  two people to carry out; we'll let you know when those come up.)</li>
  <li>Does this mean I have to find someone else in the class (whom I may not know yet), ask if they want to be partners for the assignment,  exchange Email addresses and/or cellphone numbers, and then follow up?  Yes. </li>
  <li>Does that mean my partner and I have to work out a schedule to meet, or at least communicate, about the assignment? Yes, it does. When you pick a partner 
    (or the members of a larger group), have a brief conversation about what your availability is. It won't be an excuse that you have to work in the afternoons 
  and your partner isn't free in the mornings.</li>
  <li>Does this mean it's okay to split up the assignment, so that each partner does half? No. The assignments are designed to be enough work for one person; 
    we ask you to do them in pairs because you'll learn more that way. The goal isn't just to get answers onto the page; the goal is to learn from the experience 
  of working on the problems.</li>
  <li>What's the most dangerous aspect of working in pairs? One partner can be passive, letting the other take the lead and do the work. Then the passive partner 
    doesn't do well on the exams. This can happen especially when one partner has more experience or background than the other. It's each partner's job to ask enough 
    questions to master the concepts, and it's each partner's job to make sure that both partners get the answers they need. Sometimes it seems easier just to let 
    one partner take the lead, but that's a failure. Concepts can seem to make sense when you just hear them, but to be able to <em>apply</em> them (on an exam, 
    let's say), you have to be actively engaged in the assignments.</li>
</ul></FONT>
<P>
  <FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Plagiarism&mdash;don&#39;t do it:</B>  Plagiarism
    means presenting somebody else&#39;s work as if it&#39;s your own.  You
    may use whatever outside sources (books, friends, interviews, periodicals)
    are appropriate for an assignment, so long as you cite them:  Any time you
    use two or more words in a row that you didn&#39;t think up and write yourself,
    you must put the words in quotation marks and indicate where they came from.
    (There could be situations where this two-word rule isn&#39;t appropriate.
    If you think you have one, check with us.)  Even if you paraphrase (state
    in your own words) someone else&#39;s work or ideas, you should cite the
    source (e.g., &quot;Dijkstra says that unrestricted branching is dangerous.&quot;).
    Plagiarism is academically dishonest, and we expect that nobody in the
class will engage in it.  </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Turning in another person's work as your own violates the honesty policies of ICS and UCI (<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php">http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php</a>). The School of ICS takes academic honesty very seriously and imposes serious penalties on students who violate its guidelines. Detected violations could result in your failing the course, having a letter filed with the school, and losing a variety of other benefits and privileges. We do check for academic dishonesty both manually and automatically. It is an unfortunate fact that nearly every quarter, some students in ICS classes are found to have violated these policies; to protect the privacy of the guilty, violations are not made public, but sadly, they do occur. Compared to the consequences of academic dishonesty, one low assignment score is a minor disadvantage. If you feel as if you're falling behind or have other difficulties, see the instructor; we will help you work around your trouble.  No matter
how pressured you feel, don&#39;t plagiarize; it&#39;s not worth it.</FONT></P>
<p><font size="4" face="AGaramond">Most importantly, realize that getting &quot;the answer&quot; is only the last part of each assignment. Equally important is the process of getting the solution&mdash;including the false starts, bugs, misconceptions, and mistakes&mdash;because the learning occurs in the doing. Completely apart from the ethical issues, copying a solution deprives you of the whole point of the assignment.</font></p>
