<b>Abstract</b><BR>

Automated reasoning with graphical models has found many practical applications in
domains such as planning, vision, speech recognition, genetic linkage analysis, diagnostics,
and many others. Graphical models, combining graph theory and probability
theory, facilitate a compact and structured representation for problems with uncertainty
and provide a mechanism for answering queries such as computing the probability of
an event given observations.<br>
Several exact algorithms for reasoning with graphical models exist. However,
exact computation is not always possible due to prohibitive time and memory demands.
In general, computing exact posterior marginals and even approximating posterior
marginals within a desired degree of precision is NP-hard. In practice, we often
choose methods that can quickly compute approximate answers to Bayesian queries,
trading accuracy for speed. Approximation methods include algorithms for approximate
inference, stochastic sampling, network simplifications (simplifying the structure
of the underlying graph), and variational approximations. We often obtain a more flexible
computation scheme, balancing complexity and accuracy, by combining exact and
approximate computation. This dissertation focuses on combining search with existing
sampling and bounding methods yielding two new schemes for approximating and
bounding posterior marginals in Bayesian networks. Those two new schemes, cutset
sampling and any-time bounds, exploit the network structure to bound the complexity
of exact computation.<br>
Cutset sampling for computing approximate posterior marginals samples only a
subset of variables, a cutset of the underlying graph. Since reducing the size of the sampling
set results in lower sampling variance, cutset-based sampling converges faster
than sampling on a full set of variables. Two variants of cutset sampling algorithm
were developed. One, based on Gibbs sampling, is a general approach to collapsed
Gibbs sampling in Bayesian networks. The second algorithm implements the likelihood
weighting on a cutset. The proposed any-time bounds framework is an any-time
scheme for computing bounds on posterior marginals. It enumerates a subset of cutset
tuples and performs exact inference over these tuples and then bounds the remaining
probability mass.<br>
Both methods exploit the problemï¿½s underlying network structure to control the
time and space complexity of the computations. They focus on finding a cutset of the
graph such that the complexity of exact reasoning is bounded when the cutset variables
are assigned. The dissertation proposes a new algorithm for finding a minimum cost
cutset that yields the specified complexity bound on exact inference.
