Combinatorial Geometry
</H2>
This is a difficult topic to define precisely
without including all of discrete and computational geometry.
What I mean by "combinatorial geometry" consists of
problems in which one starts with a geometric figure
(say a <A HREF="polytope.html">polytope</A>) but then considers abstract
incidence properties
of it rather than its metric properties.
Most <A HREF="tiling.html">tiling</A>
and <A HREF="color.html">coloring</A> problems fit into this class,
but since they have their own sections of the junkyard, I omit them here.

seven points at integer distances in general position
