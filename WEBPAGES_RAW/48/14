Thrackles<br>
Mike Dillencourt, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

A thrackle is a graph that can be drawn in the plane so that 

<ol>
<li>its edges are represented by simple curves; and</li>

<li>any two distinct edges either meet at a single common endpoint
or cross at exactly one point, interior to both curves.</li>
</ol>

Thirty years ago, Conway conjectured that an <i>n</i>-vertex
thrackle has at most <i>n</i> edges. Lov&aacute;sz, Pach and
Szegedy recently made major progress towards resolving this
conjecture, by proving that an <i>n</i>-vertex thrackle has at most
2<i>n</i> edges. In this talk, I will present their proof.
