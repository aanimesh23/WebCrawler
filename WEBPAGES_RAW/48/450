Abstract: We present an asymptotic fully polynomial 
approximation scheme 
for strip-packing, or packing rectangles into a 
rectangle of fixed width 
and minimum height, a classical NP-hard cutting-stock problem. The 
algorithm, based on a new linear-programming relaxation, 
finds a packing 
of n rectangles whose total height is within a factor of (1+e) of 
optimal (up to an additive term), and has running time polynomial both 
in n and in 1/e.
