<h1>Peer-to-Peer Flash Dissemination</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>

<a href="http://www.answers.com/flash&r=67"> "Flash" </a> has many meanings but
I use it in two specific ways: <br>
<I> (1) Noun</I>: A brief news dispatch or transmission   and as an
<br>
<I> (2) Adverb </I> : Happening suddenly or very quickly.
<br>
Thus, as applied to flash dissemination, it means dissemination of a relatively small
amount of data very quickly.  What is small is relative, but in my research, I consider
anything less than 25MB as small.  This is in comparison to 'large' files such as movies and
OS-distros that are hundreds of MBs of GBs in size.
<br>


<br>
<b>Why is Flash Dissemination (FD) useful and where can it be applied?</b>
<br>
<br>
When you think about it (and you can verify this), close to 90% of files (even excluding system files)
sitting on your computer are small files (in terms of numbers). Thus, most information that people generate
and store is in small files. Even cell phone generated video clips (which are becoming increasingly prevelant) are
small files (less than 10 MB); so are YouTube clips. And when a piece of information becomes
suddenly popular, you have to handle its distribution scalably. The premise of my thesis is that the optimizations
and the systems you need for scalably disseminating small files require a different approach and different set of
optimizations as compared to large file content distribution (aka BitTorrent, Joost, etc.).

<br>
<br>
In my PhD research, I've demonstarted two uses for FD. In one appplication,
<a href="crew_ics_tr_2005.pdf"> RapID (PDF file warning) </a> distributes
<a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/shakemap/"> Earthquake ShakeMaps </a>
to emergency response organizations extremely fast. In experiments run on a
<a href="model-net-details.html"> Internet Emulator </a>, we show that RapID
can disseminate shakemaps (of 200KBs) almost twice as fast as any other system currently
available.
<br>
In another application, <a href="http://flashback.calit2.uci.edu"> Flashback </a> (
<a href="papers/flashback-dcs07.pdf"> research paper </a>), we show another reason why distributing
small content fast is a unique and interesting problem. Again, Flashback performs much better than simply
adapting a large content distribution protocol (e.g. BitTorrent) for the purpose.
<br>
<br>
<b> How do I believe your numbers (aka, show me the money)? </b>
<br>
To make our numbers as convincing as possible we built an <a href="model-net-details.html"> Internet Testbed </a>
which we call COIE (for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths"> Crisis on Infinite Earths </a>
or Cluster Of Ibm E-servers) using <a href="http://modelnet.ucsd.edu/"> Modelnet </a>. The testbed was built on a
cluster of 15 IBM e-server nodes running Debian and
<a href="http://wiki.systemimager.org/index.php/Main_Page"> SystemImager </a>. This testbed
is capable of real-time emulation of upto 200 virtual internet hosts and one can even individually
set each virtual node's bandwidth and also inter-node latency.
<br>
We build real systems and compare them to other real deployed systems on this testbed.  As far as numbers go,
we feel this is as close as you can get without actually deploying your system on the wide-area internet.  Of course,
the final proof of the pudding will be in real-world deployment.  We are currently readying Flashback for such a deployment.
You can help us in visiting the <a href="http://flashback.calit2.uci.edu"> Flashback web-page </a> and giving it a try
and letting us know how it worked for you.

<h2>Dynamicity in P2P Networks</h2>
<p>
From a science perspective, I'm also extremely curious about the fundamental
properties and characteristics of P2P networks and their relation to other types
of networks such as ecological, social and technological (WWW, router-network). The
physics modeling of these networks is another topic that I try to follow to the
best of my understanding :)
<br>
In a small study, I investigated how different networks evolve over time.
using well-known models of network formation such as random graphs and
power-law graphs. My primary focus was on P2P overlay networks but the results
that emerged showed that resulting networks are also sometimes observed in nature.
<br>
With regards to P2P overlays, the main conclusion that emerged is that, it is better
to design network protocols that do not implicitly
or explicitly encourage power-law (or rich get richer) behavior.

<h1>Middleware Design and Implementation</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>
Previously, I've been involved in enhancing scalability of CORBA middleware part of the
<a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/"> DOC Group </a> led by
Prof. Douglas Schmidt.
<br>
I co-designed and implemented the first server-side Asynchronous Method Handling (AMH)
mechanism for CORBA middleware in
<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html"> TAO </a>
AMH solves the problem of stack-blowup on server-side due to large number of long-standing
requests on middle-tier servers. The solution involved explicitly encapsulating each server
request into a heap-stored object that freed up stack-space of the server-thread while
also allowing it to do other work. AMH improves throughput of middle-servers by over
10% as compared to other traditional synchronous threading designs.
<br>
Implementation involved designing a new specification for CORBA server-side, changes to the IDL-compiler,
and the ORB-core of TAO, an industry-strength CORBA middleware that is over 100K lines of C++ code.
