<H1>Quicktime VR and Mathematical Visualization</H1>

Many mathematical constructions, particularly in geometry, can be
understood more easily if some form of animation or motion is displayed.
Animated GIFs, MPEG, and Quicktime are popular formats for simple animations,
but do not allow for interaction.

<P>The three most common methods for interactive display of three
dimensional objects on the web seem to be
the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML),
Apple's <A HREF="http://quicktimevr.apple.com/">Quicktime VR</A> (QTVR),
and Java.  All can be used with Netscape or other browsers on both
Windows and Mac platforms; Java also works on Unix machines but the
other two apparently do not.  VRML represents three-dimensional objects
directly, with an interface allowing the objects and point of view to
both move, but is limited to displaying only three dimensional Euclidean
space and (because it must be rendered in realtime) can only do certain
primitive types of rendering.  Since Java is a programming language, it
can (theoretical) display anything, and its user interface controls need
not correspond directly to camera motion; its limits are set by
programmer competence and the same realtime rendering problem that
besets VRML.  QTVR objects are formed simply from a set of precomputed
image frames, so it is as unlimited as Java in the types of object it
can display, it doesn't require as much programming effort, and it also
avoids the realtime rendering bottleneck of the other two methods.
QTVR's user interface only provides for two degrees of freedom but those
degrees of freedom can like Java be used to control any parameter, not
just camera motion.  Therefore QTVR seems the most flexible option for
mathematical visualizations requiring only limited user interaction.
(QTVR also excels in viewing photographic or photographic-quality images
such as fashion modeling, landscapes, and architectural walkthroughs.)
However, QTVR's bandwidth requirements are typically much higher than
the other methods.

<P>Herewith my efforts in the use of QTVR
for mathematical visualization.

<H2>Box in a Box</H2>

This exercise illustrates the solution to a problem
<A HREF="../box-in-box.html">posed on sci.math by Carl Parkes</A>:
what is the smallest cube that can be put inside another cube
touching all the faces?  Or equivalently what is the largest cube
that can circumscribe another cube in such a way that all its faces are
touched.  In my solution, the inner cube is scaled by a factor of 3/5
from the outer, and is rotated 60 degrees along the main diagonal.
If the outer cube is the unit cube [0,1]<sup>3</sup>, the inner cube's
vertex coordinates are all integer multiples of 1/5.

Originally, as with most of my geometry junkyard entries, I illustrated
this with a line drawing made in Adobe Illustrator (also using Adobe
Dimensions to help with the 3d orthogonal perspective; for more
complicated drawings I use Mathematica or POV-Ray for perspective help):

<A HREF="bb-illo.ps">postscript source</A>
(<!--#fsize file="bb-illo.ps" -->)
</CENTER>

<P>Later, I redid this drawing as a raytraced rendering.
Some of the complications here included making the outer box look
transparent, but not distorting the inner box's shape, and still making it
possible to visualize the outer shape. I used POV-Ray's glass texture,
modified to turn off refraction, increase surface roughness, and
decrease the amount of specular reflection.  The image size is about 2/3 that
of the original line art, and to the eye looks even smaller (more like
1/2 the size); the more realistic rendering helps make up for the
loss in size, but the animated GIF's constant motion is distracting.
The QTVR version has better color resolution than the GIF, allows for a
greater variety of viewpoints, and allows
the user to understand the shape better by controlling the direction
from which it is viewed.

Views were chosen with 6 degrees
of separation, decreased from QTVR's recommendation of 10 for greater
smoothness of rotation.
Vertical camera angle ranges from 0 to 66 degrees (20 degrees for the GIF).
Because of the symmetry of the configuration, rendering only needed to be
done through a 120 degree horizontal rotation, saving a factor of 3 in
file size and rendering time.
Even so, the 240 frames in the full QTVR object use 4MB of storage
and took 6&nbsp;1/2 hours to render on a 200MHz PowerPC 603.
This was my first QTVR project, and my first animated GIF, so I spent a
lot of time trying different image compression options, color maps, and
so on, finally settling on dithering for the GIF and JPEG compression
(100% quality) for the
QTVR frames. Lower quality JPEGs were smaller but made
the inner cube's edges blurry; ConvertToMovie's "Graphics" option was my
second choice for QTVR image format.

<H2>Three Untetrahedralizable Objects</H2>

The three shapes below are examples of objects that can not be divided
into tetrahedra without adding extra "Steiner" vertices. 
<A HREF="../untetra/">More mathematical information is available on the
associated web page</A>.

<P>I made these as demos for a <A HREF="/~eppstein/280g/">graduate seminar
on mesh generation</A>, to be viewed in class on my laptop computer,
so the movies are large (both in pixels, 400x400, and in bytes, 6M to 9M).
Due to time and space limitations I only rendered one degree of freedom.

Because of the symmetry of the configuration, rendering only needed to be

polyhedron, and a 180 degree rotation for the other two.
The Chazelle polyhedron
(formed in POV-Ray as a constructive solid geometry combination of
44 halfspaces and a cube) was particularly slow to generate: each frame
took roughly 12 minutes to render on a 200MHz PowerPC 603.
Images were not compressed in conversion to QTVR.
