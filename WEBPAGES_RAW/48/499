<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigmod/index.html">ACM
Special Interest Group on Management of Data</a> (SIGMOD) wants undergraduate
students who have an interest in database systems to experience the cutting
edge research presented at the <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigmod/conferences/index.html">ACM 
SIGMOD / PODS Joint Confs</a>. (Intl. Conf. on Management of Data and Symposium
on Principles of Database Systems).</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">In order to help those undergraduate students
attend the conference, hence encouraging them to pursue a career
related to database research, a scholarship program was introduced by
SIGMOD in 2000 and successfully continued in the following years.
It is worthwhile noting that the program has been of a truly 
international nature.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> Each scholarship provides up to
US$1,000 to defray conference attendance costs (e.g., travel and
lodging) plus Conference registration.  Awardees will be responsible
for their own travel arrangements, including health insurance if
necessary.  Selected students will be recognized at the <a
href="http://sigmod07.riit.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.shtml">ACM SIGMOD 2007</a> awards
sessions.
</font>
<P>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">
All undergraduate students who have completed
or are enrolled in a database course by the application deadline are
eligible for the scholarship. Note that, for the purpose of
this award, a student is considered 
an undergraduate student if he/she has not yet obtained an BS (or 
equivalent) degree or has obtained that degree on or after December 2006, and 
he/she is not enrolled in a graduate program at the time of the
application.

If the applicant's
school system is "non-traditional", and the applicant consider
him/herself eligible then the committee should be 
contacted before the application is submitted.
<i>All application materials must be received no later than May 1,
2007</i>.  Decisions will be sent to the applicants by May 9,
2007.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In order to apply for the scholarship,
students must send an email to <b>sigmod07ugrad AT ics DOT uci DOT edu</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The subject of the email should be <b>"<i>&lt;candidate's name> ACM SIGMOD
Scholarship APPLICATION</i>"</b>.&nbsp; The following information should be
included (<i>not</i> attached) in the email in <b><i>plain text</i></b>. No HTML,
PDF, Postscript or any other type of data will be accepted.</font>

<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">List all courses (and respective final grades)
taken so far in the undergraduate program as well as current GPA. 
</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">List any scholarships, awards or honors earned.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">List of publications (if any) and or
non-trivial (e.g., non-course) projects in which the applicant participated.
</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">In 100 words or less, write about "why am I
interested in database research and how would I benefit from attending
SIGMOD/PODS 2007."</font></li>
</ol>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Additionally, the student must have a qualified
person send an email to <b>sigmod07ugrad AT ics DOT uci DOT edu</b>.&nbsp;
The subject of the email should be <b>"<i>&lt;candidate's name> ACM SIGMOD
Scholarship NOMINATION</i>"</b>. The following information should be included
(<i>not</i> attached) in the email in <b><i>plain text</i></b> as well (again,
no HTML, PDF, Postscript or any other type of data will be accepted).&nbsp;

</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Nominator's Name</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">University and Position</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Professional Organization Affiliations (e.g.,
ACM, SIGMOD, IEEE, etc.)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A statement about the relative 
standing (performance-wise) of the nominee at his/her University, in
particular in database courses, and how
far from graduation the nominee is (i.e., what percentage of the program 
has been completed at application time).</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">In 100 words or less, justify "why the nominee
deserves to receive this scholarship". 
</font></li>
</ol>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">By sending a nomination, all nominators
explicitly agree to be contacted by the ACM SIGMOD Undergraduate
Scholarship Program Committee to clarify any of the points of his/her
nomination. All applications should be plain text with the proper
subject lines as explained above. Any application that does not
satisfy these conditions may be flagged as junk mail and automatically
discarded without further notification.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The decisions made by the ACM SIGMOD 
Undergraduate Scholarship Program Committee will be final. The Committee
also reserves the right to not award the scholarships to any applicant.
We look forward to receiving a large number 
of applications and wish all applicants the best of luck.
