<h1>CS 164/266, Spring 2014:<br>
Computational Geometry</h1>


<hr>
<p></p>

<h2>General Course Information</h2>

<p>The two courses CS 164 (for undergraduates) and CS 266 (for graduate
students) are co-located this year: they will have the same lectures,
but different homework and exam problems.</p>

<p>For both courses, coursework will consist of weekly homeworks, a
midterm, and a comprehensive final exam. The course grade will be
weighted as 10% from homeworks, 40% from the midterm, and 50% from the final.
Group work on homeworks is
permitted; each student should turn in his or her own copy of the
homeworks. Exams will be closed book, closed notes, and closed friends.
The course text is <i>Computational Geometry Algorithms and
Applications</i>, 3nd ed., by de Berg, van Kreveld, Overmars, and
Cheong (Springer-Verlag, 2008). An electronic version is available
for no charge from UCI internet addresses at <a
href="http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-77974-2">
SpringerLink</a>.</p>

<p>Each course meets Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3:30-4:50, in <s>PSCB
140</s> MOVED
TO <a href="http://www.classrooms.uci.edu/GAC/SH134.html">STEINHAUS
134</a> as of April 6.</p>

<p>The final exam will be Tuesday, June 10, 4:00-6:00. 
Homeworks will be assigned on Thursdays, posted on this web page, and due at the start of the lecture on the following Thursday. The teaching
assistant is <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mbannist/">Michael
Bannister</a>, mbannist@uci.edu; his office hourse are Monday 2:30-4:30
in Bren 4219 and Wednesday 1:00-3:00 in Bren 3013.</p>
