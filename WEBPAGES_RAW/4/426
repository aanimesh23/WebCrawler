<ul><li>Raw sequence data (raw_data/*_sequence.txt) was processed using eland to create raw/*_eland_multi.txt <br>
<li>ChipSeq-mini 2.0 (http://woldlab.caltech.edu/html/software, now part of the ERANGE package) was used to process the eland files and produce the processed/*.bed files.  <br>
<li>IgG files are for the control run, SREBP1 files are after fasting and refeeding. See paper for details.<br>
