<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"><b>Note</b>: These
are guidelines intended to help students plan their work in this
course. However, the instructor reserves the right to make changes to
this syllabus over the course of the quarter. <br>
<br>
</span><b><u><br>
Overview</u></b>
from UCI Catalogue<br>
The "disappearing computer" paradigm. Differences to the desktop
computing model: applications, interaction in augmented environments,
security, alternate media, small operating systems, sensors, and
embedded systems design. <span style="font-style: italic;">Evaluation
by project work and class participation</span>.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Policies</u></b>
<br>
<b>Add/drop</b>: Electronic Add/Drop only. Standard University time
lines apply. <br>
<br>
<b>Attendance</b>: Students are responsible for material that is
disseminated during class. If you miss class, please arrange beforehand
with a friend to get notes/handouts for you. If you know you are going
to miss something important, contact the instructor beforehand. It's
much easier to accommodate planned absences.
If you send an excuse after missing a class, please provide
documentation. Students are responsible for all material taught in this
course. If you
join the class later in the quarter, you are expected to complete all
missed work immediately.
<br>
<br>
<b>Sick Policy</b>: If you find that you are unable to make it to a
scheduled event (class, exam, presentation, etc.) due to sickness,
please get some documentation from a health care provider to assist us
in maintaining fairness to the other students in the class. In the
absence of such documentation, please contact the staff as soon as you
realize that you are going to miss a scheduled event. Generally
sicknesses will be treated on a case by case basis. We will accommodate
you as best as we can depending on the circumstances. <br>
<br>
<b>Respect</b>: This class will involve discussion of topics on which
you and your classmates may have differences in opinion. Please be
respectful of others at all times. <br>
<br>
<b>Academic Honesty</b>: Please familiarize yourself with the latest <a href="http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm">UCI
academic honesty policy</a><a>. The consequences of academic dishonesty
are not worth the risks. <br>
<br>
<b>Students with Disabilities or Special Needs</b>: <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></a><a>see <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></a><a href="http://www.disability.uci.edu/services_accommodations/">here</a>
for accommodations that can be made<a><br>
<br>
<b>Technology in Class</b>: Please turn off all mobile
phones/pagers/etc. before the beginning of each class. Please do not
use notebook computers or any other technology during class for any
purpose not directly relating to this class. <br>
<br>
<b>Web Page, Readings, and Assignments</b>: The web page for the class
is subject to update. Check it frequently and be sure to refresh /
reload the web pages when you browse them. Please follow the
assignments exactly. If you need clarification, ask before the
assignment is due. See tips on <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></a><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Ekobsa/courses/efficientReading.pdf">efficient
reading</a><a>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Course announcements</span> will be
sent to your UCI email account, hence check it regularly. If you prefer
to read your email on another account, you should <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></a><a href="https://apps.oit.uci.edu/phupdate/phupdate">forward your Email
to your preferred account</a><a>.<br>

<br>
<a> <b>Readings</b>: Each week there will be several articles, videos,
or other pieces of content assigned. You should read/view the items
before coming to class on the day that they are listed. You may need to
be on campus, or <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></a><a href="http://www.oit.uci.edu/vpn/">logged in via VPN</a><a>, to access
some of these materials without paying for them.&nbsp; </a>
<p><a>The required book for this class is John Krumm, ed. (2009):
Ubiquitous Computing Fundamentals. CRC Press. <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></a><a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></a><a href="http://www.addall.com/New/submitNew.cgi?query=978-1420093605&amp;type=ISBN&amp;location=10000&amp;state=CA&amp;dispCurr=USD">Hardcover</a>,

<b>Reading Summaries</b>: At the beginning of thee classes you will be
asked to write a one-paragraph summary of one or more recent
readings/videos. These reading summaries will not be announced. There
are no makeups for missed summaries without a doctor's note or other
clear evidence of an excusable absence.
<br>
<br>
<b>Leading Discussion</b>: Your team is being asked to lead discussion
at one class meeting during this course. Here are some <a href="http://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/history/resources/study/leaddiscussion/">tips
on how to lead a discussion</a>. Your grade will be based on the
following criteria: 1) Articulates author's argument correctly and
completely; 2) Identifies nuances of author's argument; 4) Poses
thoughtful, open-ended questions or creative exercises to the class; 5)
Guides discussion to important points; 6) Maintains control of the
classroom. <br>
<br>
<b>Class Participation</b>: A large part of this course is based on
discussion of the topics. Your grade will be based in part on your
attendance, attention, and participation in class discussions. <br>
<br>
<b>Final Project</b>: Working in teams of 4-5 students, you will engage
in a ubicomp project. This project may focus on any topic of mutual
interest to the members of the group. It could involve implementing a
novel ubicomp system, evaluating an existing ubicomp system, or some
other project relevant to the course. If you are uncertain of what kind
of project to pursue, I encourage you to think about personalized
services enabled by building sensors, or technical privacy protections
in IoT environments. There will be two interim deliverables, and two
final deliverables. The interim deliverables are:
<ol>
  <li> a 1-page summary of your project idea including tentative
software and hardware needs (and which of those you can meet
yorselves). This one-pager should be accompanied by a list of
20 relevant references with DOIs or URLs, of which many should be from
the Pervasive and at least some from the Ubicomp conference. Upload one
document per team <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/dropbox/index.php?op=openfolder&amp;folder=427420">here</a>.<br>
 </li>
  <li> a 7-8 minute presentation about your progress to date. </li>
</ol>
Your final deliverables are:
<ol>
  <li>a 4-page academic paper, appropriate for submission as <a href="http://www.percom.org/?q=wip">research-in-progress to the 2026
IEEE PerCom Conference</a>. One paper per <a href="http://eee.uci.edu/signupsheet/teamsignup">team</a>. You are expected to
cite an appropriate selection of the academic literature in your paper.
The submission deadline is <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">November
27</span>.</li>
  <li> a 1-3 minute video describing your project (One video per <a href="http://eee.uci.edu/signupsheet/teamsignup">team</a>.)</li>
  <li>a 1 minute "madness" talk that summarizes your research goals and
your main accomplishments.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<b>Peer Reviewing</b>: The class will be performing a "peer review"
process as part of the final project evaluation. Each student will be
asked to review the papers written by two other <a href="http://eee.uci.edu/signupsheet/teamsignup">teams</a>. In addition,
students will be asked to review their own paper using the same
criteria. In writing your reviews, please be rigorous and kind; the
goal is to help your fellow-students make better work, and want to work
more. <br>
<br>
Assignments and Readings must be completed BEFORE the class for which
they are due.<br>
