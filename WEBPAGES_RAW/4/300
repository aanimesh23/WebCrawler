Lesson Plans and Teaching Materials
</H2>
I've heard parents complain "my daughter makes collages from magazine
clippings in her high school geometry class instead of learning real
math".  Some of the lesson plans listed here are like that,
but are perhaps appropriate as auxiliary material.  The better plans
here teach some real mathematics as the students perform their projects.
I haven't made much attempt to go through the rest of the junkyard
to find appropriate teaching resources that aren't already arranged into
lesson plans; you'd be better off doing it yourself.
