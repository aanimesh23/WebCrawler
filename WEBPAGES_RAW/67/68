Signatures of Correct Computation

We introduce <i>Signatures of Correct Computation</i> (SCC), a new
model for verifying computation in cloud settings. In an SCC model, a
trusted <i>source</i> outsources a function <i>f</i> to an untrusted
<i>server</i>, along with a public key for that function. The server
can then produce a succinct signature &sigma; vouching for the
correctness of the computation of <i>f</i>, i.e., that some result <i>v</i> is
indeed the correct outcome of the function <i>f</i> evaluated on some point
<b>a</b>. Moreover, the signature verification must take
asymptotically less time than evaluating the function <i>f</i>. We
construct efficient SCC schemes supporting expressive manipulations
over multivariate polynomials, including polynomial evaluation and
differentiation, and we prove that our constructions are
adaptively-secure in the random oracle model.
</p>
<p>
We also show that signatures of correct computation imply
<i>Publicly Verifiable Computation</i> (PVC), a model recently
introduced by the research community. Roughly speaking, in the SCC
model, <i>any client</i> can verify the signature &sigma; and be
convinced of some computation result, whereas in the PVC model only
the client that issued a query (or anyone who trusts this client) can
verify that the server returned a valid signature (proof). Our
techniques can be readily adapted to construct publicly verifiable
computation schemes with adaptive security and <i>without the
random oracle model</i>.
