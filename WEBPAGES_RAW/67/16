    <p>Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming model that
    tackles a specific problem: capturing consistent units of a
    software system that the traditional programming models force to
    be spread among several modules of the program implementations. In
    this light, aspects are those consistent units that happen to
    crosscut other units. A concrete example will make these
    definitions more clear.</p>

    <p>Take a telecom system, with Customers, Calls and
    Connections. The basic operation of this system relates to the
    calls that customers make, including conference calls and merging
    of different connections into the same call. Over this basic
    operation, there is a timing feature which tracks the 
    connection time per customer. And over that, there may be a billing
    feature that charges costumers for the calls they make, according
    to the amount of time they used and the types of calls they made.
    </p>

    <p>Think for a moment how you would implement this using, say, an
    Object-Oriented Programming model. Customers, calls and
    connections are natural candidates for objects whose behavior is
    defined by class implementations. The timing feature could also be
    implemented by a group of classes, including, at least, a
    timer. Even though you may be able to isolate the functionality of
    the timing feature into a group of classes, there must be some
    code in the basic classes that invokes the timing feature at
    appropriate points in the operation of the telecom system. So, for
    example, it's plausible that everytime there is a new connection
    we must start a timer; it's also plausible that calls made by
    certain special customers are not timed. The points at which the
    timing feature is invoked by the basic objects is an important and
    consistent part of this system, and its specification can change
    independent of all the other parts.
    </p>

    <p>Using a language that supports AOP, we can capture these
    dependencies in implementation modules of their own. In this case,
    we can have one module in the program that encapsulates the
    information about when the timing feature is invoked. Doing things
    this way, we can trace changes in the specification of the timing
    feature into one consistent unit of the program implementation. We
    can even unplug the timing feature from the system without having
    to change a single line of code of the basic classes,
    preserving the integrity of the basic operation.</p>

    <p>What else? There are many more examples of how thinking in
    terms of aspects can have a positive impact in software
    development. Software developers out there have already embraced
    some of these ideas, especially for helping them develop their
    systems by having aspects such as tracing, profiling and
    testing. You can find out much more about how developers are using
    AOP by following the links to the AOP-related sites listed on the
    left.</p>

    <p>The quest for better software development models and tools
     doesn't end with the current state of AOP. A lot more can be done
     in this field. For project ideas and general information, please
