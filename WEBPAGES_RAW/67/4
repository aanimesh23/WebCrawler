<p>  Marginal MAP is known to be a difficult task for graphical models,
  particularly because the evaluation of each MAP assignment involves
  a conditional likelihood computation. In order to minimize the
  number of likelihood evaluations, we focus in this paper on
  best-first search strategies for exploring the space of partial MAP
  assignments. We analyze the potential relative benefits of several
  best-first search algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness
  against recent branch and bound schemes through extensive empirical
  evaluations. Our results show that best-first search improves
  significantly over existing depth-first approaches, in many cases by
  several orders of magnitude, especially when guided by relatively
  weak heuristics.

<p>Crowdsourcing provides a cheap but efficient approach for large-scale data and
information collection. %large scale collection of human intelligence.
However, human judgments are inherently noisy, ambiguous and sometimes biased,
and should be calibrated by additional (usually much more expensive) expert or
true labels. % expert or In this work, we study the optimal allocation of the
true labels to best calibrate the crowdsourced labels.  We frame the problem as
a submodular optimization, and propose a greedy allocation strategy that
exhibits an interesting trade-off between a <it>local effect</it>, which
encourages acquiring true labels for the most uncertain items, and a <it>global
effect</it>, which favors the true labels of the most ``influential" items,
whose information can propagate to help the prediction of other items.  We show
that exploiting and monitoring the global effect yields a significantly better
selection strategy, and also provides potentially valuable information for
other tasks such as designing stopping rules.

<p>Region choice is a key issue for many approximate inference bounds.
Mini-bucket elimination avoids the space and time complexity of exact inference
by using a top-down partitioning approach that mimics the construction of a
junction tree and aims to minimize the number of regions subject to a bound on
their size; however, these methods rarely take into account functions' values.
In contrast, message passing algorithms often use "cluster pursuit" methods to
select regions, a bottom-up approach in which a pre-defined set of clusters
(such as triplets) is scored and incrementally added.  In this work, we develop
a hybrid approach that balances the advantages of both perspectives, providing
larger regions chosen in an intelligent, energy-based way.  Our method is
applicable to bounds on a variety of inference tasks, and we demonstrate its
power empirically on a broad array of problem types.

<p>Importance sampling (IS) and its variant, annealed IS (AIS) have been widely
used for estimating the partition function in graphical models, such as Markov
random fields and deep generative models. However, IS tends to underestimate
the partition function and is subject to high variance when the proposal
distribution is more peaked than the target distribution.  On the other hand,
"reverse" versions of IS and AIS tend to overestimate the partition function,
and degenerate when the target distribution is more peaked than the proposal
distribution.  In this work, we present a simple, general method that gives
much more reliable and robust estimates than either IS (AIS) or reverse IS
(AIS).  Our method works by converting the estimation problem into a simple
classification problem that discriminates between the samples drawn from the
target and the proposal.  We give extensive theoretical and empirical
justification; in particular, we show that an annealed version of our method
significantly outperforms both AIS and reverse AIS as proposed by Burda et al.
(2015), which has been the state-of-the-art for likelihood evaluation in deep
generative models.

<p>Distributed learning of probabilistic models from multiple data repositories
with minimum communication is increasingly important.  We study a simple
communication-efficient learning framework that first calculates the local
maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) based on the data subsets, and then combines
the local MLEs to achieve the best possible approximation to the global MLE
given the whole dataset.  We study this framework's statistical properties,
showing that the efficiency loss compared to the global setting relates to how
much the underlying distribution families deviate from full exponential
families, drawing connection to the theory of information loss by Fisher, Rao
and Efron.  We show that the ``full-exponential-family-ness" represents the
lower bound of the error rate of arbitrary combinations of local MLEs, and is
achieved by a KL-divergence-based combination method but not by a more common
linear combination method.  We also study the empirical properties of both
methods, showing that the KL method significantly outperforms linear
combination in practical settings with issues such as model misspecification,
non-convexity, and heterogeneous data partitions.

<p>We explore the use of iterative cost-shifting as a dynamic heuristic
generator for solving MPE in graphical models via Branch and Bound. When
mini-bucket elimination is limited by its memory budget, it may not provide
good heuristics. This can happen often when the graphical model has a
very high induced width with large variable domain sizes. In addition, we
explore a hybrid setup where both MBE and the iterative cost-shifting
bound are used in a combined heuristic. We compare these approaches with
the most advanced statically generated heuristics.

<p>Marginal MAP problems are known to be very difficult tasks for graphical models
and are so far solved exactly by systematic search guided by a join-tree upper
bound. In this paper, we develop new AND/OR branch and bound algorithms for
marginal MAP that use heuristics extracted from weighted mini-buckets enhanced
with message-passing updates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting
search algorithms against previous join-tree based approaches, which we also
extend to apply to high induced width models, through extensive empirical
evaluations. Our results show not only orders-of-magnitude improvements over
the state-of-the-art, but also the ability to solve problem instances well
beyond the reach of previous approaches.

<p>In this work, we propose the marginal structured SVM (MSSVM) for structured
prediction with hidden variables. MSSVM properly accounts for the uncertainty
of hidden variables, and can significantly outperform the previously proposed
latent structured SVM (LSSVM; Yu & Joachims (2009)) and other state-of-art

in a smoother objective function, making gradient-based optimization of MSSVMs
converge significantly faster than for LSSVMs.  We also show that our method
consistently outperforms hidden conditional random fields (HCRFs; Quattoni et
al. (2007)) on both simulated and real-world datasets.  Furthermore, we propose
a unified framework that includes both our and several other existing methods
as special cases, and provides insights into the comparison of different models
in practice.

<p>The track-oriented multiple hypothesis tracker (TOMHT) is a popular algorithm
for tracking multiple targets in a cluttered environment. In tracking parlance
it is known as a multi-scan, maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator – multi-scan
because it enumerates possible data associations jointly over several scans,
and MAP because it seeks the most likely data association conditioned on the
observations. This paper extends the TOMHT, building on its internal
representation to support probabilistic queries other than MAP estimation.
Specifically, by summing over the TOMHT's pruned space of data association
hypotheses one can compute marginal probabilities of individual tracks.  Since
this summation is generally intractable, any practical implementation must
replace it with an approximation.  We introduce a factor graph representation
of the TOMHT’s data association posterior and use variational message-passing
to approximate track marginals. In an empirical evaluation, we show that
marginal estimates computed through message-passing compare favorably to those
computed through explicit summation over the k-best hypotheses, especially as
the number of possible hypotheses increases. We also show that track marginals
enable parameter estimation in the TOMHT via a natural extension of the
expectation maximization algorithm used in single-target tracking. In our
experiments, online EM updates using approximate marginals significantly
increased tracker robustness to poor initial parameter specification.

<p>Functional brain imaging is a common tool in monitoring the progression of
neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. Identifying functional brain
imaging derived features that can accurately detect neurological disease is of
primary importance to the medical community. Research in computer vision
techniques to identify objects in photographs have reported high accuracies in
that domain, but their direct applicability to identifying disease in
functional imaging is still under investigation in the medical community. In
particular, Serre et al. (2005) introduced a biophysically inspired filtering
method emulating visual processing in striate cortex which they applied to
perform object recognition in photographs. In this work, the model described by
Serre et al. (2005) is extended to three-dimensional volumetric images to
perform signal detection in functional brain imaging (PET, SPECT). The filter
outputs are used to train both neural network and logistic regression
classifiers and tested on two distinct datasets: ADNI Alzheimer’s disease
2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET and National Football League players Tc99m HMPAO
SPECT. The filtering pipeline is analyzed to identify which steps are most
important for classification accuracy. Our results compare favorably with other
published classification results and outperform those of a blinded expert human
rater, suggesting the utility of this approach.

<p>Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are extremely useful for modeling and solving
sequential decision making problems.  Graph-based MDPs provide a compact
representation for MDPs with large numbers of random variables.  However, the
complexity of exactly solving a graph-based MDP usually grows exponentially in
the number of variables, which limits their application.  We present a new
variational framework to describe and solve the planning problem of MDPs, and
derive both exact and approximate planning algorithms.  In particular, by
exploiting the graph structure of graph-based MDPs, we propose a factored
variational value iteration algorithm in which the value function is first
approximated by the multiplication of local-scope value functions, then solved
by minimizing a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.  The KL divergence is
optimized using the belief propagation algorithm, with complexity exponential
in only the cluster size of the graph.  Experimental comparison on different
models shows that our algorithm outperforms existing approximation algorithms
at finding good policies.

<p>We study the problem of estimating continuous quantities, such as prices,
probabilities, and point spreads, using a crowdsourcing approach.  A
challenging aspect of combining the crowd's answers is that workers'
reliabilities and biases are usually unknown and highly diverse.  Control items
with known answers can be used to evaluate workers' performance, and hence improve
the combined results on the target items with unknown answers.  This raises the
problem of how many control items to use when the total number of items each workers can
answer is limited: more control items evaluates the workers better, but leaves
fewer resources for the target items that are of direct interest, and vice versa.
We give theoretical results for this problem under different scenarios, and
provide a simple rule of thumb for crowdsourcing practitioners.  As a byproduct,
we also provide theoretical analysis of the accuracy of different
consensus methods.

<p>Maximum Likelihood learning of graphical models is not possible in problems
where inference is intractable. In such settings it is common to use
approximate inference (e.g. Loopy BP) and maximize the so-called ``surrogate''
likelihood objective. We examine the effect of using different
approximate inference methods and, therefore, different surrogate likelihoods,
on the accuracy of parameter estimation. In particular, we consider
methods that utilize a control parameter to trade
computation for accuracy. We demonstrate empirically that cheaper, but worse
quality approximate inference methods should be used in the small data setting
as they exhibit smaller variance and are more robust to model mis-specification.

<p>Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference is one of the fundamental inference tasks
in graphical models. MAP inference is in general NP-hard, making approximate
methods of interest for many problems. One successful class of approximate
inference algorithms is based on linear programming (LP) relaxations. The
augmented Lagrangian method can be used to overcome a lack of strict convexity
in LP relaxations, and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
provides an elegant algorithm for finding the saddle point of the augmented
Lagrangian. Here we present an ADMM-based algorithm to solve the primal form of
the MAP-LP whose closed form updates are based on a linear approximation
technique. Our technique gives efficient, closed form updates that converge to
the global optimum of the LP relaxation. We compare our algorithm to two
existing ADMM-based MAP-LP methods, showing that our technique is faster on
general, non-binary or non-pairwise models.

<p>The marginal maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem, which
calculates the mode of the marginal posterior distribution of a subset of
variables with the remaining variables marginalized, is an important inference
problem in many models, such as those with hidden variables or uncertain
parameters. Unfortunately, marginal MAP can be NP-hard even on trees, and has
attracted less attention in the literature compared to the joint MAP
(maximization) and marginalization problems. We derive a general dual
representation for marginal MAP that naturally integrates the marginalization
and maximization operations into a joint variational optimization problem,
making it possible to easily extend most or all variational-based algorithms to
marginal MAP. In particular, we derive a set of “mixed-product" message passing
algorithms for marginal MAP, whose form is a hybrid of max-product, sum-product
and a novel “argmax-product" message updates. We also derive a class of
convergent algorithms based on proximal point methods, including one that
transforms the marginal MAP problem into a sequence of standard marginalization
problems. Theoretically, we provide guarantees under which our algorithms give
globally or locally optimal solutions, and provide novel upper bounds on the
optimal objectives. Empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms
significantly outperform the existing approaches, including a state-of-the-art
algorithm based on local search methods.

<p>Earlier work has explored enhancing the perceived resolution of a display by
shifting multiple different low-resolution images by fractions of a pixel and
overlaying them in a temporally multiplexed fashion. This increases the
manufacturing cost and also sacrifices the temporal resolution that can
compromise other capabilities like 3D active stereo. In this paper we propose a
method to achieve the same goal in projectors by performing the pixel shift and
superposition optically by introducing a simple and inexpensive optical
ensemble of a set of lenses on the projector light path. This does not
sacrifice the temporal resolution and is extremely easy to implement in
practice.

However, instead of overlaying different images, we overlay an image with one
or more sub-pixel shifted copies of itself.  Therefore, we seek a single n × n
image which when shifted and overlaid with itself creates a perceptually closer
to a higher resolution 2n × 2n target image. This changes the optimization
formulation significantly and requires solving a system of sparse linear
equations. We take advantage of this sparsity and design a parallel
implementation of this optimization in GPUs for real-time computation of the
input image critical for its practical implementation. But, since this system
is more constrained that using multiple overlaid images, the enhancement of
resolution is compromised. However, since the optical design is very simple
and inexpensive, it can be deployed on a variety of low-cost projectors and
still offer a significant image quality benefit.

<p>Crowdsourcing has become a popular paradigm for labeling large datasets.
However, it has given rise to the computational task of aggregating the
crowdsourced labels provided by a collection of unreliable annotators. We
approach this problem by transforming it into a standard inference problem in
graphical models, and applying approximate variational methods, including
belief propagation (BP) and mean field (MF).  We show that our BP algorithm
generalizes both majority voting and a recent algorithm by Karger et al.
(2011), while our MF method is closely related to a commonly used EM algorithm.
In both case, we find that the performance of the algorithms critically depends
on the choice of a prior distribution on the workers' reliability; by choosing
the prior properly, both BP and MF (and EM) perform surprisingly well on both
simulated and real-world datasets, competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms
based on more complicated modeling assumptions.

<p>We describe a new optimization scheme for finding high-quality correlation
clusterings in planar graphs that uses weighted perfect matching as a
subroutine. Our method provides lower-bounds on the energy of the optimal
correlation clustering that are typically fast to compute and tight in
practice. We demonstrate our algorithm on the problem of image segmentation
where this approach outperforms existing global optimization techniques in
minimizing the objective and is competitive with the state of the art in
producing high-quality segmentations.

<p>The track-oriented multiple hypothesis tracker is currently the preferred
method for tracking multiple targets in clutter with medium to high
computational resources. This method maintains a structured representation of
the track posterior distribution, which it repeatedly extends and optimizes
over.  This representation of the posterior admits probabilistic inference
tasks beyond MAP estimation that have yet to be explored.  To this end we
formulate the posterior as a graphical model and show that belief propagation
can be used to approximate the track marginals.  These approximate marginals
enable an online parameter estimation scheme that improves tracker performance
in the presence of parameter misspecification.

a Branch and Bound search guided by the heuristic function calculated by one of

<p>We introduce a new cluster-cumulant expansion (CCE) based on the fixed points
of iterative belief propagation (IBP). This expansion is similar in spirit to
the loop-series (LS) recently introduced in Chertkov and Chernyak (2006). However,
in contrast to the latter, the CCE enjoys the following important qualities: 1)
it is defined for arbitrary state spaces 2) it is easily extended to fixed
points of generalized belief propagation (GBP), 3)  disconnected groups of
variables will not contribute to the CCE and 4) the accuracy of the expansion
empirically improves upon that of the LS. The CCE is based on the same
Mobius transform as the Kikuchi approximation, but unlike GBP does not
require storing the beliefs of the GBP-clusters nor does it suffer from
convergence issues during belief updating.

<p>Variational inference algorithms such as belief propagation have had tremendous
impact on our ability to learn and use graphical models, and give many insights
for developing or understanding exact and approximate inference.  However,
variational approaches have not been widely adoped for <i>decision making</i>
in graphical models, often formulated through influence diagrams and including
both centralized and decentralized (or multi-agent) decisions.  In this work,
we present a general variational framework for solving structured cooperative decision-making
problems, use it to propose several belief propagation-like algorithms, and
analyze them both theoretically and empirically.

<p>We study the marginal-MAP problem on graphical models, and present a novel
approximation method based on direct approximation of the sum operation.  A
primary difficulty of marginal-MAP problems lies in the non-commutativity of
the sum and max operations, so that even in highly structured models,
marginalization may produce a densely connected graph over the variables to be
maximized, resulting in an intractable potential function with exponential
size.  We propose a chain decomposition approach for summing over the
marginalized variables, in which we produce a structured approximation to the
MAP component of the problem consisting of only pairwise potentials.  We show
that this approach is equivalent to the maximization of a specific variational
free energy, and it provides an upper bound of the optimal probability.
Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our method performs favorably
compared to previous methods.

<p>The role of the circadian clock in skin and the identity of genes participating
in its chronobiology remain largely unknown, leading us to define the circadian
transcriptome of mouse skin at two different stages of the hair cycle, telogen
and anagen. The circadian transcriptomes of telogen and anagen skin are largely
distinct, with the former dominated by genes involved in cell proliferation and
metabolism. The expression of many metabolic genes is antiphasic to cell
cycle-related genes, the former peaking during the day and the latter at night.
Consistently, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, a byproduct of oxidative
phosphorylation, and S-phase are antiphasic to each other in telogen skin.
Furthermore, the circadian variation in S-phase is controlled by BMAL1
intrinsic to keratinocytes, because keratinocyte-specific deletion of Bmal1
obliterates time-of-day–dependent synchronicity of cell division in the
epidermis leading to a constitutively elevated cell proliferation. In agreement
with higher cellular susceptibility to UV-induced DNA damage during S-phase, we
found that mice are most sensitive to UVB-induced DNA damage in the epidermis
at night. Because in the human epidermis maximum numbers of keratinocytes go
through S-phase in the late afternoon, we speculate that in humans the
circadian clock imposes regulation of epidermal cell proliferation so that skin
is at a particularly vulnerable stage during times of maximum UV exposure, thus
contributing to the high incidence of human skin cancers.

<p>Estimating statistical models within sensor networks requires distributed
algorithms, in which both data and computation are distributed across the nodes

combining local estimators defined by pseudo-likelihood components,
encompassing a number of combination methods, and provide both theoretical and

methods, when combined with second-order information, are statistically
competitive with more advanced and costly joint optimization. Our algorithms
have many attractive properties including low communication and computational
cost and "any-time" behavior.

<p>We investigate a hybrid of two styles of algorithms for deriving bounds for 
optimization tasks over graphical models: non-iterative message-passing schemes
exploiting variable duplication to reduce cluster sizes (e.g. MBE) and iterative
methods that re-parameterize the problem's functions aiming to produce good
bounds even if functions are processed independently (e.g. MPLP). In this work
we combine both ideas, augmenting MBE with re-parameterization, which we call
MBE with Moment Matching (MBE-MM). The results of preliminary empirical
evaluations show the clear promise of the hybrid scheme over its individual com-
ponents (e.g., pure MBE and pure MPLP). Most significantly, we demonstrate the
potential of the new bounds in improving the power of mechanically generated
heuristics for branch and bound search.

<p>Many algorithms and applications involve repeatedly solving
variations of the same inference problem, for example to introduce
new evidence to the model or to change conditional dependencies. As
the model is updated, the goal of \emph{adaptive inference} is to
take advantage of previously computed quantities to perform
inference more rapidly than from scratch.  In this paper, we present
algorithms for adaptive exact inference on general graphs that can
be used to efficiently compute marginals and update MAP
configurations under arbitrary changes to the input factor graph and
its associated elimination tree. After a linear time preprocessing
step, our approach enables updates to the model and the computation
of any marginal in time that is logarithmic in the size of the input
model. Moreover, in contrast to max-product our approach can also be
used to update MAP configurations in time that is roughly
proportional to the number of updated entries, rather than the size
of the input model.  
To evaluate the practical effectiveness of our
algorithms, we implement and test them using synthetic data as well as
for two real-world computational biology applications. Our experiments show that
adaptive inference can achieve substantial speedups over performing
complete inference as the model undergoes small changes over time.

<p>  Dual-decomposition (DD) methods are quickly becoming important tools
  for estimating the minimum energy state of a graphical model.  DD
  methods decompose a complex model into a collection of simpler
  subproblems that can be solved exactly (such as trees), that in
  combination provide upper and lower bounds on the exact solution.
  Subproblem choice can play a major role:
  larger subproblems tend to improve the bound more per iteration,
  while smaller subproblems enable highly parallel solvers and can
  benefit from re-using past solutions when there are few changes
  between iterations.

  We propose an algorithm that can balance many of these aspects to
  speed up convergence.  Our method uses a cluster tree
  data structure that has been proposed for adaptive exact inference
  tasks, and we apply it in this paper to dual-decomposition
  approximate inference.  This approach allows us to process large
  subproblems to improve the bounds at each iteration, while allowing
  a high degree of parallelizability and taking advantage of
  subproblems with sparse updates.
  For both synthetic inputs and a real-world stereo matching problem,
  we demonstrate that our algorithm is able to achieve significant
  improvement in convergence time.

<p>Given a graphical model, one of the most useful queries is to find the most
likely configuration of its variables.  This task, known as the maximum a
posteriori (MAP) problem, can be solved efficiently via message passing
techniques when the graph is a tree, but is NP-hard for general graphs.
Jebara (2009) shows that the MAP problem can be converted into the
stable set problem, which can be solved in polynomial time for a broad class of
graphs known as perfect graphs via a linear programming relaxation technique.
This is a result of great theoretical interest.  However, the article
additionally claims that max-product linear programming (MPLP) message passing
techniques of Globerson & Jaakkola (2007) are also guaranteed to solve these
problems exactly and efficiently.  We investigate this claim, show that it does
not hold in general, and attempt to repair it with several alternative message
passing algorithms.

results of other threads are made available.  We demonstrate our algorithm on
Gibbs sampling in Boltzmann machines and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).  We
show in experiments that our algorithm achieves near linear speed-up in the
number of cores, is faster than existing exact samplers, and is nearly as fast

regularization with a power law regularization and  optimize the objective
function by a sequence of iteratively reweighted L1 regularization
problems, where the regularization coefficients of nodes with high degree are
reduced, encouraging the appearance of hubs with high degree. Our method can be
easily adapted to improve <i>any</i> existing L1-based methods, such as
graphical lasso, neighborhood selection, and JSRM when the underlying networks
are believed to be scale free or have dominating hubs. We demonstrate in

<p>Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a popular algorithm for discovering semantic structure in

size, its use on increasingly massive collections has created considerable interest in
parallel implementations.  ``Approximate distributed'' LDA, or AD-LDA,
approximates the popular collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for LDA models while
running on a distributed architecture.  Although this algorithm often appears to perform well
in practice, its quality is not well understood theoretically or easily assessed on new data.  In this work, we
theoretically justify the approximation, and modify AD-LDA to track an
error bound on performance.  Specifically, we upper-bound the probability of making
a sampling error at each step of the algorithm (compared to an exact, sequential Gibbs sampler),
given the samples drawn thus far.  We show empirically that our bound is sufficiently tight to give
a meaningful
and intuitive measure of approximation error in AD-LDA, allowing the user to track the
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency while executing in parallel.

<p>Continuous quantities are ubiquitous in models of real-world phenomena,
but are surprisingly difficult to reason about automatically.  Probabilistic
graphical models such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields,
and algorithms for approximate inference such as belief propagation,
have proven to be powerful
tools in a wide range of applications in statistics and artificial intelligence.
However, applying these methods to models with continuous variables remains
a challenging task.  In this work we describe an extension of belief propagation
to continuous variable models, generalizing particle filtering and Gaussian mixture
filtering techniques for time series to more complex models.  We illustrate the
power of the resulting nonparametric belief propagation algorithm via two applications:
kinematic tracking of visual motion and distributed localization in sensor networks.

often provide high-quality solutions.  In this paper, we improve upon
these algorithms in two ways.  First, we introduce covering trees, a variant of
TRW which provide the same bounds on the MAP energy as TRW with far fewer
variational parameters. Optimization of these parameters can be carried out
efficiently using either fixed--point iterations (as in TRW) or sub-gradient
based techniques.  Second, we introduce a new technique that utilizes bipartite
matching applied to the min-marginals produced with covering trees in order to
compute a tighter lower-bound for the quadratic assignment problem.  We apply
this machinery to the problem of finding correspondences with pairwise energy
functions, and demonstrate the resulting hybrid method outperforms TRW alone
and a recent related subproblem decomposition algorithm on benchmark image
correspondence problems.

<p>Learning undirected graphical models such as Markov random fields is an
important machine learning task with applications in many domains.
Since it is usually intractable to learn these models exactly, various 
approximate learning techniques have been developed, such as contrastive 
divergence (CD) and Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation 
(MCMC-MLE).  In this paper, we introduce particle filtered MCMC-MLE, which is 
a sampling-importance-resampling version of MCMC-MLE with 
additional MCMC rejuvenation steps.  
We also describe a unified view of (1) MCMC-MLE, (2) our particle filtering approach,
and (3) a stochastic approximation procedure known as persistent contrastive
divergence.  We show how these approaches are related to each other
and discuss the relative merits of each approach.
Empirical results on various undirected models demonstrate that 
the particle filtering technique we propose in this paper
can significantly outperform MCMC-MLE.  Furthermore, in certain 
cases, the proposed technique is faster than persistent CD.

<p>Composite likelihood methods provide a wide spectrum of computationally efficient 
techniques for statistical tasks such as parameter estimation and model selection.  
In this paper, we present a formal connection between the optimization of composite 
likelihoods and the well-known contrastive divergence algorithm. In particular, we 
show that composite likelihoods can be stochastically optimized by performing a 
variant of contrastive divergence with random-scan blocked Gibbs sampling. By using 
higher-order composite likelihoods, our proposed learning framework makes it 
possible to trade off computation time for increased accuracy. Furthermore, one can 
choose composite likelihood blocks that match the model's dependence structure, 
making the optimization of higher-order composite likelihoods computationally 
efficient.  We empirically analyze the performance of blocked contrastive 
divergence on various models, including visible Boltzmann machines, conditional 
random fields, and exponential random graph models, and we demonstrate that using 
higher-order blocks improves both the accuracy of parameter estimates and the rate 
of convergence.

<p><b>Motivation:</b> Time-course gene expression datasets provide important insights into dynamic aspects of biological processes, such as circadian rhythms, cell cycle and organ development. In a typical microarray time-course experiment, measurements are obtained at each time point from multiple replicate samples. Accurately recovering the gene expression patterns from experimental observations is made challenging by both measurement noise and variation among replicates' rates of development. Prior work on this topic has focused on inference of expression patterns assuming that the replicate times are synchronized. We develop a statistical approach that simultaneously infers both (i) the underlying (hidden) expression profile for each gene, as well as (ii) the biological time for each individual replicate. Our approach is based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) combined with a probabilistic model that accounts for uncertainty about the biological development time of each replicate.
<br>
<b>Results:</b> We apply GPR with uncertain measurement times to a microarray dataset of mRNA expression for the hair-growth cycle in mouse back skin, predicting both profile shapes and biological times for each replicate. The predicted time shifts show high consistency with independently obtained morphological estimates of relative development. We also show that the method systematically reduces prediction error on out-of-sample data, significantly reducing the mean squared error in a cross-validation study.

<p>Since the development of loopy belief propagation, there has been considerable
work on advancing the state of the art for approximate inference over
distributions defined on discrete random variables. Improvements include
guarantees of convergence, approximations that are provably more accurate, and
bounds on the results of exact inference.  However, extending these methods  to
continuous-valued systems has lagged behind.  While several methods have been
developed to use belief propagation on systems with continuous values, recent 
advances for discrete variables have not as yet been incorporated.

In this context we extend a recently proposed particle-based belief propagation
algorithm to provide a general framework for adapting discrete message-passing
algorithms to inference in continuous systems.  The resulting
algorithms behave similarly to their purely discrete counterparts, extending
the benefits of these more advanced inference techniques to the continuous
domain.

<b>Results:</b> We present an analysis of variance (ANOVA) periodicity detector and its Bayesian extension that can be used to discover periodic transcripts of arbitrary shapes from replicated gene expression profiles.

We provide an empirical Bayes procedure for estimating parameters of the prior distributions and derive closed-form expressions for the posterior probability of periodicity, enabling efficient computation. The model is applied to two datasets profiling circadian regulation in murine liver and skeletal muscle, revealing a substantial number of previously undetected non-sinusoidal periodic transcripts in each. We also apply quantitative real-time PCR to several highly ranked non-sinusoidal transcripts in liver tissue found by the model, providing independent evidence of circadian regulation of these genes.

<p>Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a popular algorithm for discovering structure in
large collections of text or other data.  Although its complexity is linear in the data
size, its use on increasingly massive collections has created considerable interest in
parallel implementations.  ``Approximate distributed'' LDA, or AD-LDA,
approximates the popular collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for LDA models while
running on a distributed architecture.  Although this algorithm often appears to perform well
in practice, its quality is not well understood or easily assessed.  In this work, we
provide some theoretical justification of the algorithm, and modify AD-LDA to track an
error bound on its performance.  Specifically, we upper-bound the probability of making
a sampling error at each step of the algorithm (compared to an exact, sequential Gibbs sampler),
given the samples drawn thus far.  We show empirically that our bound is sufficiently tight to give
a meaningful
and intuitive measure of approximation error in AD-LDA, allowing the user to understand the
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

<p>Many applications involve repeatedly computing the optimal, maximum
<i>a posteriori</i> (MAP) configuration of a graphical model as the
model changes, often slowly or incrementally over time, e.g., due to
input from a user.
Small changes to the model often require
updating only a small fraction of the MAP configuration, suggesting
the possibility of performing updates faster than recomputing from
scratch.
In this paper we present an algorithm for efficiently performing such
updates under arbitrary changes to the model.
Our algorithm is within a logarithmic factor of the optimal and is
asymptotically never slower than re-computing from-scratch: if a
modification to the model requires $m$ updates to the MAP
configuration of $n$ random variables, then our algorithm requires
$O(m\log{(n/m)})$ time; re-computing from scratch requires $O(n)$
time.
We evaluate the practical effectiveness of our algorithm by
considering two problems in genomic signal processing, CpG region
segmentation and protein sidechain packing, where a MAP configuration
must be repeatedly updated.  Our results show significant speedups
over recomputing from scratch.

Specifically, we give more general convergence conditions for convergence of the LDLC decoder (under the same assumptions of the original LDLC convergence analysis). We discuss how to extend the LDLC decoder from Latin square to full rank, non-square matrices. We propose an efficient construction of sparse generator matrix and its matching decoder. We report preliminary experimental results which show our decoder has comparable symbol to error rate compared to the original LDLC decoder.

<p>The hair follicle renews itself by repeatedly cycling among growth, regression,

is also of interest because abnormal regulation of hair cycle control genes is
responsible for several types of human hair growth disorders and skin cancers.
We report here that <i>Clock</i> and <i>Bmal1</i> genes,
which control circadian rhythms, are also important for the regulation of hair
follicle cycling, a biological process of much longer duration than 24 hours.
Detailed analysis of skin from mice mutated for central clock genes indicates a
significant delay in the progression of the hair growth phase. We show that
clock genes affect the expression of key cell cycle control genes and that
keratinocytes in a critical compartment of the hair follicles in
<i>Bmal1</i> mutant mice are halted in the G1 phase of the cell
cycle. These findings provide novel insight into circadian control mechanisms
in modulating the progression of cyclic biological processes on different time

<p>The popularity of particle filtering for inference in Markov chain
models defined over random variables with very large or continuous
domains makes it natural to consider sample--based versions of belief
propagation (BP) for more general (tree--structured or loopy) graphs.
Already, several such algorithms have been proposed in the
literature.  However, many questions remain open about the behavior
of particle--based BP algorithms, and little theory
has been developed to analyze their performance.
In this paper, we describe a generic particle belief propagation (PBP)
algorithm which is closely related to previously proposed methods.
We prove that this algorithm is consistent, approaching the true BP
messages as the number of samples grows large.
We then use concentration bounds to analyze the finite-sample
behavior and give a convergence rate for the algorithm on
tree--structured graphs.  Our convergence rate is $O(1/\sqrt{n})$
where $n$ is the number of samples, independent of the domain size
of the variables.

<p>In this paper we introduce a novel collapsed Gibbs sampling method for the
widely used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. Our
new method results in significant speedups on real world text
corpora. Conventional Gibbs sampling schemes for LDA require
O(K) operations per sample where K is the number of
topics in the model. Our proposed method draws equivalent
samples but requires on average significantly less then K operations per sample.
On real-word corpora FastLDA can be as much as 8
times faster than the standard collapsed Gibbs sampler for LDA. No approximations are
necessary, and we show that our fast sampling
scheme produces exactly the same results as the standard
(but slower) sampling scheme. Experiments on four real world
data sets demonstrate speedups for a wide range of
collection sizes. For the PubMed collection of over 8 million
documents with a required computation time of 6 CPU months for LDA,
our speedup of 5.7 can save 5 CPU months of computation.

Normal periodic behavior is modeled via a time-varying Poisson process model, which in turn is modulated by a hidden Markov process that accounts for bursty events. We outline a Bayesian framework for learning the parameters of this model from count time-series. Two large real-world datasets of time-series counts are used as testbeds to validate the approach, consisting of freeway traffic data and logs of people entering and exiting a building. We show that the proposed model is significantly more accurate at detecting known events than a more traditional threshold-based technique. We also describe how the model can be used to investigate different degrees of periodicity in the data, including systematic day-of-week and time-of-day effects, and to make inferences about different aspects of events such as number of vehicles or people involved. The results indicate that the Markov-modulated Poisson framework provides a robust and accurate framework for adaptively and autonomously learning how to separate unusual bursty events from traces of normal human activity.

Our bound is relatively simple to compute, and compares favorably

<p>In data assimilation for a system which evolves in time, one combines past and current observations with a model of the dynamics of the
system, in order to improve the simulation of the system as well as any future predictions about it. From a statistical point of view, this process can
be regarded as estimating many random variables which are related both spatially and temporally: given observations of some of these variables,
typically corresponding to times past, we require estimates of several others, typically corresponding to future times.
<p>
Graphical models have emerged as an effective formalism for assisting in these types of inference tasks, particularly for large numbers of
random variables. Graphical models provide a means of representing dependency structure among the variables, and can provide both intuition
and efficiency in estimation and other inference computations. We provide an overview and introduction to graphical models, and describe how
they can be used to represent statistical dependency and how the resulting structure can be used to organize computation. The relation between
statistical inference using graphical models and optimal sequential estimation algorithms such as Kalman filtering is discussed. We then give
several additional examples of how graphical models can be applied to climate dynamics, specifically estimation using multi-resolution models of
large-scale data sets such as satellite imagery, and learning hidden Markov models to capture rainfall patterns in space and time.

non-parametric Bayesian framework for modeling collections of such data. In
particular, we use a Dirichlet process framework for learning a set of intensity
functions corresponding to different categories, which form a basis set for representing
individual time-periods (e.g., several days) depending on which categories
the time-periods are assigned to. This allows the model to learn in a data-driven
fashion what factors are generating the observations on a particular day, including
(for example) weekday versus weekend effects or day-specific effects corresponding
to unique (single-day) occurrences of unusual behavior, sharing information
where appropriate to obtain improved estimates of the behavior associated
with each category. Applications to realworld data sets of count data involving
both vehicles and people are used to illustrate the technique.

<p>Time-series of count data are generated in many different contexts, such as web access logging, freeway traffic monitoring, and security logs associated with buildings. Since this data measures the aggregated behavior of individual human beings, it typically exhibits a periodicity in time on a number of scales (daily, weekly,etc.) that reflects the rhythms of the underlying human activity and makes the data appear non-homogeneous. At the same time, the data is often corrupted by a number of bursty periods of unusual behavior such as building events, traffic accidents, and so forth. The data mining problem of finding and extracting these anomalous events is made difficult by both of these elements. In this paper we describe a framework for unsupervised learning in this context, based on a time-varying Poisson process model that can also account for anomalous events. We show how the parameters of this model can be learned from count time series using statistical estimation techniques. We demonstrate the utility of this model on two datasets for which we have partial ground truth in the form of known events, one from freeway traffic data and another from building access data, and show that the model performs significantly better than a non-probabilistic, threshold-based technique. We also describe how the model can be used to investigate different degrees of periodicity in the data, including systematic day-of-week and time-of-day effects, and make inferences about the detected events (e.g., popularity or level of attendance). Our experimental results indicate that the proposed time-varying Poisson model provides a robust and accurate framework for adaptively and autonomously learning how to separate unusual bursty events from traces of normal human activity.

<p>Nonparametric Bayesian approaches to clustering,
information retrieval, language modeling
and object recognition have recently shown great
promise as a new paradigm for unsupervised data
analysis. Most contributions have focused on the
Dirichlet process mixture models or extensions
thereof for which efficient Gibbs samplers exist.
In this paper we explore Gibbs samplers for
infinite complexity mixture models in the stick
breaking representation. The advantage of this
representation is improved modeling flexibility.
For instance, one can design the prior distribution
over cluster sizes or couple multiple infi-
nite mixture models (e.g., over time) at the level
of their parameters (i.e., the dependent Dirichlet
process model). However, Gibbs samplers for in-
finite mixture models (as recently introduced in
the statistics literature) seem to mix poorly over
cluster labels. Among others issues, this can have
the adverse effect that labels for the same cluster
in coupled mixture models are mixed up. We
introduce additional moves in these samplers to
improve mixing over cluster labels and to bring
clusters into correspondence. An application to
modeling of storm trajectories is used to illustrate
these ideas.

<p>Distributed inference methods developed for graphical models comprise a principled
approach for data fusion in sensor networks. The application of these methods, however,
requires some care due to a number of issues that are particular to sensor networks.
Chief of among these are the distributed nature of computation and
deployment coupled with communications bandwidth and energy constraints typical
of many sensor networks. Additionally, information sharing in a sensor network necessarily
involves approximation. Traditional measures of distortion are not sufficient to characterize the
quality of approximation as they do not address in an explicit manner the resulting impact on inference
which is at the core of many data fusion problems. While both graphical models and a distributed
sensor network have network structures associated with them, the mapping is not one to one.
All of these issues complicate the mapping of a particular inference problem to a given sensor network
structure. Indeed, there may be a variety of mappings with very different characteristics with
regard to computational complexity and utilization of resources. Nevertheless, it is the case that
many of the powerful distributed inference methods have a role in information fusion for sensor
networks. In this article we present an overview of research conducted by the authors that has
sought to clarify many of the important issues at the intersection
of these domains. We discuss both theoretical issues and prototypical
applications in addition to suggesting new lines of reasoning.

<p>Particle filtering is often applied to the problem of object tracking
under non-Gaussian uncertainty; however, sensor networks frequently
require that the implementation be local to the region of interest,
eventually forcing the large, sample-based representation to be moved
among power-constrained sensors. We consider the problem of successive
approximation (i.e., lossy compression) of each sample-based density
estimate, in particular exploring the consequences (both theoretical and
empirical) of several possible choices of loss function and their
interpretation in terms of future errors in inference, justifying their
use for measuring approximations in distributed particle filtering.

<p>Understanding the dependency structure of a set of variables is a

data association. The simple task of detecting whether any
dependency exists is particularly difficult when models of the data

dependency and how to carry out these tests with highdimensional
observations. In addition we present a method to assess
the significance of the tests.

<p>Automatic self-localization is a critical need for the effective use of
ad-hoc sensor networks in military or civilian applications.  In general,
self-localization involves the combination of absolute location
information (\eg GPS) with relative calibration information (\eg distance
measurements between sensors) over regions of the network. Furthermore, it
is generally desirable to distribute the computational burden across the
network and minimize the amount of inter-sensor communication.  We
demonstrate that the information used for sensor localization is
fundamentally local with regard to the network topology and use this
observation to reformulate the problem within a graphical model framework.
We then present and demonstrate the utility of \emph{nonparametric belief
propagation} (NBP), a recent generalization of particle filtering, for
both estimating sensor locations and representing location uncertainties.
NBP has the advantage that it is easily implemented in a distributed
fashion, admits a wide variety of statistical models, and can represent
multi-modal uncertainty. Using simulations of small- to moderately-sized
sensor networks, we show that NBP may be made robust to outlier
measurement errors by a simple model augmentation, and that judicious
message construction can result in better estimates. Furthermore, we
provide an analysis of NBP's communications requirements, showing that
typically only a few messages per sensor are required, and that even low
bit-rate approximations of these messages can have little or no
performance impact.

potential to affect the solution obtained adversely.  We analyze the
effect resulting from message approximation under two particular measures

This analysis leads to convergence conditions for traditional BP message
passing, and both strict bounds and estimates of the resulting error in

<p>Determining the structure of dependencies among a set of variables is a
common task in many signal and image processing applications, including
multi-target tracking and computer vision.  In this paper we present an
information-theoretic, machine learning approach to problems of this type.
We cast this problem as a hypothesis test between factorizations of
variables into mutually independent subsets. We show that the likelihood
ratio can be written as sums of two sets of Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence terms. The first set captures the structure of the statistical
dependencies within each hypothesis, while the second set measures the
details of model differences between hypotheses.  We then consider the
case when the signal prior models are unknown, so that the distributions
of interest must be estimated directly from data, showing that the second
set of terms is (asymptotically) negligible and quantifying the loss in
hypothesis separability when the models are completely unknown.  We
demonstrate the utility of nonparametric estimation methods for such
problems, providing a general framework for determining and distinguishing
between dependency structures in highly uncertain environments.
Additionally, we develop a machine learning approach for estimating lower
bounds on KL-divergence and mutual information from samples of
high-dimensional random variables for which direct density estimation is
infeasible. We present empirical results in the context of three
prototypical applications: association of signals generated by sources
possessing harmonic behavior, scene correspondence using video imagery,
and detection of coherent behavior among sets of moving objects.

<p>In many applications, particularly power-constrained sensor networks, it is important to
conserve the amount of data exchanged while maximizing the utility of that data for some
inference task. Broadly, this tradeoff has two major cost components—the representation’s
size (in distributed networks, the communications cost) and the error incurred by its use (the
inference cost).
<p>    We analyze this tradeoff for a particular problem: communicating a particle-based 
representation (and more generally, a Gaussian mixture or kernel density estimate). We begin by
characterizing the exact communication cost of these representations, noting that it is less than
might be suggested by traditional communications theory due to the invariance of the represen-
tation to reordering. We describe the optimal, lossless encoder when the generating distribution
is known, and pose a sub-optimal encoder which still benefits from reordering invariance.
<p>    However, lossless encoding may not be sufficient. We describe one reasonable measure of
error for distribution-based messages and its consequences for inference in an acyclic network,
and propose a novel density approximation method based on KD-tree multiscale representations
which enables the communications cost and a bound on error to be balanced efficiently. We
show several empirical examples demonstrating the method’s utility in collaborative, distributed
signal processing under bandwidth or power constraints.

The second makes use of approximate kernel density evaluation
methods to construct a fast approximate sampler, which is
guaranteed to sample points to within a tunable parameter $\epsilon$
of their true probability.
We compare both multiscale samplers on a set of computational examples

<p>In many applications of graphical models arising in computer vision, the hidden variables of interest
  are most naturally specified by continuous, non-Gaussian distributions. There exist inference algorithms
  for discrete approximations to these continuous distributions, but for the high-dimensional variables
  typically of interest, discrete inference becomes infeasible. Stochastic methods such as particle 
  filters provide an appealing alternative. However, existing techniques fail to exploit the rich
  structure of the graphical models describing many vision problems. Drawing on ideas from regularized 
  particle filters and belief propagation (BP), this paper develops a nonparametric belief propagation
  (NBP) algorithm applicable to general graphs. Each NBP iteration uses an efficient sampling procedure
  to update kernel-based approximations to the true, continuous likelihoods. The algorithm can accomodate 
  an extremely broad class of potential functions, including nonparametric representations. Thus, NBP 
  extends particle filtering methods to the more general vision problems that graphical models can 
  describe. We apply the NBP algorithm to infer component interrelationships in a parts-based face model,
  allowing location and reconstruction of occluded features.

<p>The issue of data association arises frequently in sensor
networks; whenever multiple sensors and sources are present, it
may be necessary to determine which observations from different
sensors correspond to the same target.  In highly uncertain
environments, one may need to determine this correspondence
without the benefit of an \emph{a priori} known joint
signal/sensor model.  This paper examines the data association
problem as the more general hypothesis test between factorizations
of a single, learned distribution.  The optimal test between known
distributions may be decomposed into model-dependent and
statistical dependence terms, quantifying the cost incurred by
model estimation from measurements compared to a test between
known models.  We demonstrate how one might evaluate a two-signal
association test efficiently using kernel density estimation
methods to model a wide class of possible distributions, and show
the resulting algorithm's ability to determine correspondence in
uncertain conditions through a series of synthetic examples. We
then describe an extension of this technique to multi-signal
association which can be used to determine correspondence while
avoiding the computationally prohibitive task of evaluating all
hypotheses. Empirical results of the approximate approach are
presented.
