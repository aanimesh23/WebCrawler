This example assumes that you have the setup of at the end 
of the first part of the tutorial.  The Chimera Website 
should be running and
set to the values from the previouse example.  This can be verified
by using your Chimera Server to verify that you have the following
values:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Check that you are in bill_web by clicking on the Webs tab.
    <li> Check that you have the places_to_go link set as the Active Link
	by clicking on the Links tab.
</ul>

<p> Jimage should be running and should have the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Check that it is connected to Chimera. (The status bar
	should indicate it is connected to the Chimera Server, the
	web bill_web, and to the active link places_to_go.  See
	<A HREF="connecting_jimage.html">
        Disconnecting and Reconnecting the Jimage Client to Chimera
        </A> for more information about the status bar.)

    <li> bill.gif should be displayed, and it should have an anchor on it
	which is connected to the Actvie Link (places_to_go).

    <li> earthrise.gif should be displayed, and it should have an anchor
	on it which is connected to the Active Link (places_to_go).
