Lesson 7 - Copyright 6:</FONT></H3>
<H1><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">A Copyright Owner's Conduct May<BR>
 *Sometimes* Create an &quot;Implied License&quot;<BR>
that Lets Others Copy</FONT></H1>
</CENTER><P><P>
You post something to a discussion list.  I quote your message in my response.  Have I acted illegally?<P>
 Probably not, though your message is copyrighted, and I copied it.  Your posting the message to a discussion list almost certainly gives others an "implied license" to quote it.  When a copyright owner acts in such a way that *reasonable people would assume that he's allowing them to make copies*, the law interprets his conduct as creating an &quot;implied license.&quot;<P>
A familiar non-cyber example is a letter to the editor.  If I send the letter to the newspaper that starts with &quot;Dear Mr. Editor,&quot;a reasonable person would assume that I'm allowing them to publish. This is so because this is a *customary practice*, and because almost everyone knows about this custom.  So when the newspaper publishes the letter, they'll be protected by the implied license.<P>
A few more examples:<P>
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>Someone sends a personal message to one other person. Reasonable people would generally not assume that the author is allowing the recipient to forward the message to others.  NO IMPLIED LICENSE.<P>
<LI>A newspaper posts something on its advertising - supported Web page.  Reasonable people probably wouldn't assume that it's allowing readers to forward it to news groups.  PROBABLY NO IMPLIED LICENSE.<P>
<LI>Someone sends a message to a discussion list. It's not clear whether reasonable people would assume that they're allowed to forward it to other lists.  A lot might depend on the list's customs, and on whether the list is wide open or limited to only a few people.<P>
</UL>
It should be clear by now that this is a VERY mushy test (a lot of law is, for better or worse, that way).  Fortunately, though, you as the copyright owner can make things less mushy: Implied licenses can always be EXPRESSLY REVOKED, just by saying so in a way that potential copiers will see.<P>
 If my letter to the newspaper starts with "Dear Editor: Don't publish this," then I'm not giving the newspaper any sort of license. Similarly, if my e-mail to a discussion group clearly says "Don't forward this to any other group," readers won't have an implied license to forward it.  If I were the lawyer for a newspaper that didn't want its stories copied from its Web page, I'd tell them to put up a prominent notice about this.<P>
One more important point:  An implied license can only be granted by the COPYRIGHT OWNER.  If I post someone else's software (or even someone else's newspaper article) to a bulletin board, this doesn't give anyone the implied license to do anything with it.<P><P>
