<h1>
Broadcast Encryption and Traitor Tracing for Content
Protection
</h1>

<h2>Hongxia Jin, IBM Research</h2>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
Broadcast encryption and traitor tracing are two active problems in
cryptography community.  In this talk I will give an overview on how
broadcast encryption and traitor tracing can be used for content
protection.  The focus of the talk will be on tracing traitors for
anonymous attack, a way to trace the source of unauthorized copies
when the system is broadcasted. Our solution has been adopted by
AACS, (the content protection standards for next generation high
definition DVDs),  the first large-scale deployment of traitor
tracing approach, Along the way we have had to solve both practical
and theoretical problems that had not been apparent in the literature
to date.  In this talk I will discuss some of those problems.  The
talk will also include the recent incidence of AACS "break".
