<h2>Research Themes</h2>
<p>
My research revolves around three primary themes:
<dl>
<dt><b>Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp)</b>
<dd>Computation is migrating out of the desktop PC and into the
everyday world, in the form of information appliances, everyday
digital devices, wireless networks, smart environments, and mobile,
handheld and wearable devices. Increasingly, the world itself is an
interface to computation. How can we understand these phenomena,
and design for them effectively?
<dt><b>Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)</b>
<dd>Much of what we do, even when we're working "alone", is in fact
collaborative. We work as members of teams, groups, organizations, and
societies, and we coordinate our activities with others with and
through computation. What is the impact of technology on our
interactions and collaborations with each other?
<dt><b>Social Studies of Science and Technology</b>
<dd>The design, use, and impact of technologies is determined not
solely by technical factors but also by how those technologies are
shaped by social pressures and demands. These social considerations
also shape what questions science asks and how we evaluate the answers.
</dl>

<p>
Bringing these together, much of my research considers the social
analysis of encounters between people, technology, and the everyday
world. Empirically, it draws primarily on ethnographic investigation
of work practice (but also on lab studies, survey data, and other
sources of information). Analytically, it draws on a range of largely
phenomenological positions, especially ethnomethodology. Technically,
it combines interests in databases, networks, software engineering,
and user interfaces to create novel ways for people to encounter
computation. A central concern is <i>understanding how the experience
of interactive technology allows people to create and share new forms
of practice</i>.
</p>

<p>
When I say the experience of technology, I mean not just its
usability, or other engineering-oriented metrics of effectiveness;
instead, I mean the ways in which people experience the technology as
useful or meaningful. Similarly, when I talk about practice, I mean
ways of acting with and through technology; not just how people use
computers, but how they adapt and adopt them, incorporating them into
their lives and their work.
</p>

<p>
Right now, I have two main projects.
</p>

<p>
The first is concerned with privacy and security. In this work, we
think of privacy not as something that people <i>have</i> but more as
something that people <i>do</i>. What
kinds of information practice do
people engage in, and what do they achieve through them?
We are interested in people's
collective ways of orienting towards information as private, public,
sensitive, or secret, or ways of thinking of activities as being
risky, secure, dangerous, or appropriate, and the factors that both
shape and are shaped by those forms of social meaning.
This work has empirical, technical, and conceptual elements; it is
being carried out in collaboration with a range of people, including
David Redmiles in Informatics, Simon Cole in Criminology, and Jenny
Terry in Women's Studies.
</p>

<p>
The second is concerned with spatiality. How do advanced information
technologies -- cell phones, wireless and wired networks, augmented
environments, etc. -- cause us to re-encounter the spaces through
which we move? How do we understand space in the first place? Where do
our notions of "place" and "space" come from, and what kinds of 
relationship do they have to our patterns of movement and action in
everday space? Although we take spatiality very much for granted, the
goal of this work is to think about it as a social and cultural product.
We have turned, for example, to studies of the aboriginal Australian
encounter with the mythic landscape, the Native American experience of
the moral landscape, or the many different forms of urban spatiality
as ways of provoking new imaginaries of space and technology.

are probably updated more often that this page.
