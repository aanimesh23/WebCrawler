This first "programming" assignment is not a "programming" assignment at all;
  it is designed to ensure that you know the fundamentals of using the
  computing infrastructure for this course, both on your own machine (if you
  have one) and the computers in our labs.
Primarily it concerns starting to learn to use the Eclipse Integrated
  Development Environment (IDE) for Python.
<p>
To do this assignment, you must have already downloaded and installed Java,
  Python, and the Eclipse IDE on your own computer (or be using one of the UCI
  Lab machines, where it has already been downloaded/installed).
Follow the <a href="../../../common/online33.html" targe="main">
  Download/Installation Instructions</a> for your machine, if you need to.
Ensure that you have correctly
 <a href="../../../common/handouts/pythoneclipsejava/courselib.html">setup
    the <b>courselib</b> folder</a>
  and populated it with the required Python modules: otherwise some of your
  <b>import</b> statements (in parts B, C, and D) will produce errors.
<p>
Read and follow the following instructions <b>carefully</b>.
It would be an excellent idea to print a copy of this web page, read through
  it, and highlight any details that you think are important (and might
  forget as you are working on the assignment) or that you are confused about.
Some students lose points for failing to follow directions properly; this is
  a problem that gets worse during the quarter, so starting out by doing the
  "right thing" in this assignment is an excellent idea.
If you have any questions about these instructions, for example, if you
  think they are in error, or just confusing, please post on the appropriate
  MessageBoard Forum; and make sure you examine the posts from other students.
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT: Ensure that your Checkmate dropoff is for the current/correct
     Quarter, not the previous one.</b>
<p>
Finally, carefully read the last two sections, on <b>Extra Credit</b> and
  <b>Time Management</b>.
These important sections are relevant to all programming assignments, but
  appear only in this one.

Read the
 <a href="../../../common/handouts/introtopythonineclipse/index.html"
   target="_top">
 Python Programming in the Eclipse IDE</a>
  web page (which is also accessible on the
 <a href="../../handouts.html" target="_top">Handouts</a>
 web page).
It includes all the information that you initially need to know about using
  Python in the Eclipse IDE.
This includes
<ul>
  <li>Starting/Stopping Eclipse
  <li>Running the Python Interpreter
  <li>Creating Projects in the Eclipse Workbench: new ones and existing ones
  <li>Editing scripts
  <li>Correcting syntax errors
  <li>Running scripts
  <li>Correcting execution errors
</ul>
Work through this document to understand Eclipse and gain some experience using
  it before starting this assignment.
Ask your TAs/Lab Tutors questions; please cross the "question answering
  threshold" quickly; get into the habit of being able to ask them questions,
  especially in lab.
<p>
In Part A you will run the Python interpreter to compute an answer, create a
  new project in the Eclipse workbench, create a new (trivial) script (using
  the answer computed by the interpreter) without syntax errors, run it to
  ensure that it executes correctly, and finally submit the script on the
  Checkmate Homework Dropoff sytem.
  <!-- <a href="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu" target="main">
    Checkmate Homework Dropoff</a> sytem.-->
Here is a checklist of things to do.
If you are confused or run into problems with any one, ask for help as soon as
  possible.
<ul>
<li>Start Eclipse.
<li>Start the Python interpreter in the Console.
<li>Type the following expression into the interpreter; avoid the temptation to
       cut and paste this expression.
      <b><pre>'{0:,}'.format(2**100)</pre></b>
<li>Create a new Python project in the workspace/workbench named
       <b>project0a</b>.
<li>Create a new module in this project named <b>demo</b>: the module and file
      will actually be named <b>demo.py</b>; Eclipse automatically adds the
      <b>.py</b>.
<li>Delete the comment Eclipse puts at the top of your module and replace it
      by your UCInetID and name in exactly the exact form below, including the
      punctuation, spaces, parentheses, and text: e.g.,
    <b><pre># Submitter: antpeter(Anteater, Peter)</pre></b>
<li>After leaving a blank line, type the following Python script into the
      module: practice with the editor; avoid the temptation to cut and paste
      this code.
    Actually, for the big number in single-quotes, copy/paste the value that
      you computed in the interpreter after the comma but before the closing
      parenthesis.

      <b><pre>print('My first program: a hybrid')
print('Answer (from Inteprxter) =', '1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,376')</pre></b>

<li>Fix any syntax errors that Eclipse shows (you might have introduced one by
       not entering the script corectly).
<li>Run this script to ensure that it produces the correct output in the
      Console.
<li>Finish the project by closing it in the Eclipse workbench, but <b>do not
       delete</b> it.
<li>Find the <b>Checkmate Homework Dropoff</b> link in the index of the course
      web and use it to drop off the <b>demo.py</b> file in the <b>project0a</b>
        folder in the workspace for Eclipse.
    If you need to, review the
       <a href="../../../common/handouts/checkmate/index.html" targe="main">
       Checkmate Tutorial</a> (which is also accessible on the
       <a href="../../handouts.html" target="_top">Handouts</a>
       web page).
<li>Reopen the project and ensure that you can still (re)run it.
<li>Finish the project by deleting it and delete all its resources; it is now
      no longer in the workbench or workspace.
<li>Redo all these instructions, until you can do them quickly and easily; it
      would even be useful to practice removing this submission and
      resubmitting it, so you practice doing that in Checkmate.
<li>Terminate Eclipse.
</ul>
This part of the programming assignment is very cookbook, but by the end you
  should have mastered the steps needed in creating and manipulating project
  folders and script files
  with Eclipse and Checkmate -something you will do over and over again during
  the quarter.

In Part B you will download and unzip a project and put it into the Eclipse

  syntax errors in the script, run it, correct the execution errors in the

Before beginning this part of the programming assignment, read the short
  handout on
  <a href="../../../common/handouts/bugs.html" targe="main">
  Bugs</a>.
Here is a checklist of things to do.
If you are confused or run into problems with any one, ask for help as soon as
  possible.
<ul>
<li>Start Eclipse (terminate it first, if it is currently running); notice the
      Workspace folder name in the <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window
      before you click its OK button.
<li>Download the <a href="project0b.zip">project0b</a> project folder, unzip it
      to a folder on your desktop (it should contain one file named
      <b>collatz.py</b>), and move this folder into the workspace.
<li>Create a new Python project in the workbench named <b>project0b</b> (using
      the <b>project0b</b> folder just downloaded and moved into the workspace).
<li>Disclose this project in the PyDev Package Explorer and double click the
      <b>collatz.py</b> module so that it is visible in an Editor.
<li>Notice the two syntax errors marked in red on line 68 and 76.
    <ol>
    <li>If the line numbers do not appear in the Editor, turn them on.
    <li>If there are syntax errors on lines 55 or 56, you have not
          set up the course library correctly.
        Read the
<a href="../../../common/handouts/pythoneclipsejava/courselib.html" targe="main">Course Library</a> installation instructions before proceding.
    </ol>
    Fix the errors as specified below.
    You do not yet need to understand these errors or how to fix them, but
      we will cover the necessary material soon.
<li>Fix the syntax eror on line 68 by placing a comma right after the token
      <b>cycle_count</b> and before the token <b>': test number is now'</b>.
    If the red syntax error on this line doesn't quickly disappear, issue
      the right-click | Save command.
<li>Notice that a new syntax error appears on line 71; it sometimes happens
      that one syntax error (line 71) is masked by another (line 68); when
      we fix one line, a new one shows an error.
<li>Hover over the red syntax error icon on line 71.
    It says <b>Expected::</b> which really is <b>Expected:</b> followed by
      the semicolon it expects.
    Although it underlines in the <b>if</b> token in red, the mistake is later
      in this line.
<li>Fix the syntax eror on line 71 by placing an equal sign right after the
      equal sign on this line (no separating space): here we must have
      the <b>==</b> token.
    If the red syntax error on this line doesn't quickly disappear, issue
      the right-click | Save command.
<li>Hover over the red syntax error icon on line 76.
    It says <b>Undefined variable: test_number</b> because we misspelled this
      name.
    It underlines this token in red.
<li>Fix the syntax eror on line 76 by adding a <b>b</b> in the name: it is now
      spelled correctly as  <b>test_number</b>
    If the red syntax error on this line doesn't quickly disappear, issue
      the right-click | Save command.
<li>Now the script has no syntax errors, so we can run it.
    Enter <b>3</b> to the first prompt and just press enter for the second
      (it will use the default value of True).
<li>Python will report show the script starting to run in the Console and then
       report an execution error.
<b><pre>Enter a positive number: 3
Display intermediate results[True]:
Cycle 1 : test number is now 3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Pattis\workspace\project0b\collatz.py", line 75, in <module>
    cycle_count += '2'
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +=: 'int' and 'str'</pre></b>
    It identifies an error on line 75, then shows the line, then reports the
      error, which relates to the fact that the <b>+=</b> operator cannot be
      applied to an <b>int</b>eger and a <b>str</b>ing.
<li>Fix this error by changing the string literal <b>'2'</b> into
      the integer literal <b>2</b>; now the <b>+=</b> operator is adding two
      integers.
<li>Run the script, and again
    enter <b>3</b> to the first prompt and just press enter for the second.
<li>This time the script runs to completion, but it has an intent error.
    Notice that the cycle counts increment by two, not one; so our answer
      says it requires 15 cycles, but it only requires 8.
<li>Fix this error in line 75 by changing the integer literal <b>2</b> into
      the integer literal <b>1</b>.
<li>Run the script, and again
    enter <b>3</b> to the first prompt and just press enter for the second.
    This time the script runs to completion with the correct answer.
<li>Finish the project by closing it in the Eclipse workbench, but do not
       delete it.
<li>Find the <b>Checkmate Homework Dropoff</b> link in the index of the course
      web and use it to drop off the <b>collatz.py</b> file in the
      <b>project0b</b> folder in the workspace for Eclipse.
<li>Terminate Eclipse
</ul>
Again, this part of the programming assignment is very cookbook, but by the
  end you should have mastered the steps needed in creating and manipulating
  project folders and script files with Eclipse and Checkmate -something you
  will do over and over again during the quarter.


<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
You will be writing many programming assignments during the quarter, requiring
  you to create new projects or modify existing ones.
You should be able to manipulate both kinds of projects easily in Eclipse,
  and submit them for grading in Checkmate.
<p>
Finally, whenever you want to check on a feature in Python or a library module,
  you should have a very low threshold for quickly starting Eclipse and using
  its Python Interpeter, or writing a small script, to experiment.
It is imperative that you get comfortable with this process immediately.

In Part D you will learn various ways to test Python code with the
  <b>driver.py</b> module (which is in the <b>courslib</b>), concentrating on
  how to write a testing file for use with this module's
  <b>batch_self_check</b> function.
You will write such a file to test various factorial functions, and finally
  submit this file on the Checkmate Homework Dropoff sytem.
  <!-- <a href="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu" target="main">
    Checkmate Homework Dropoff</a> sytem.-->
Here is a checklist of things to do.
If you are confused or run into problems with any one, ask for help as soon as
  possible.
<ul>
<li>Start Eclipse (terminate it first, if it is currently running); notice the
      Workspace folder name in the <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window
      before you click its OK button.
<li>Download the <a href="project0d.zip">project0d</a> project folder, unzip it
      to a folder on your desktop (it should contain one file named
      <b>facts.py</b>), and move this folder into the workspace.
<li>Create a new Python project in the workbench named <b>project0d</b> (using
      the <b>project0d</b> folder just downloaded and moved into the workspace).
<li>Disclose this project in the PyDev Package Explorer and double click the
      <b>facts.py</b> module so that it is visible in an Editor.
<li>Run this script and enter the information below to verify its behavior on
      these inputs.
    Basically when <b>driver.driver()</b> is executed, we are simulating a
      simplified "interpreter" that prompts for and executes the commands that
      we type (shown below in italics).
    In this interaction we first import the <b>fact2</b> function and then call
      it with different arguments, printing each result (although some calls
      raise exceptions).
<p>
We can enter a command at the prompt <b>Command[default]:</b> or just press
  return in which case <b>default</b> is the command; the default is always
  the command typed previously.
We will discuss the <b>!</b> and <b>?</b> commands a bit later.
<b><pre>Driver started

Command[from facts import fact2]: <it>print(fact2(0))</it>

120

Command[print(fact2('a'))]: <i>quit</i>
Driver stopped</pre></b>
</ul>
The most interesting aspect of the <b>driver</b> module is its
  <b>batch_self_check</b> function, which automatically reads, decodes, and
  executes testing commands from a file (specified by the first two arguments),
  summarizing the results (how each result is printed is based on the final
  arguments to the function).
Each parameter has a default argument, and all of them are set at the top of the
  <b>driver.py</b> module.
You can explore different argument values, but the default values are the most
  useful.

<p>
We can call this function explicitly in the "interpreter", supplying it with
  the necessary arguments, but mostly we call it via the <b>!</b>  command
  (calling it with all default arguments) or the <b>?</b> command (calling it
  with arguments entered by prompts to the user).
The following paragraphs briefly describe how to write commands in a testing
  file; then you will be asked to write a testing file for the functions in
  the <b>facts.py</b> module.
<p>
A testing file is a sequence of lines, each of which contains one testing
  command.
The character(s) starting each testing command determines what is tested.
Lines starting with <b>#</b> are special; they are comment lines; all other
  lines should start with a <b>c</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>^</b>, or relational
  operator (<b>==</b>, <b>!=</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&lt;=</b>, <b>&gt;</b>,
  <b>&gt;=</b>, <b>in</b>, or <b>not in</b>).
Each <b>c</b> command is followed by one operand; each <b>e</b>, <b>^</b>, or
  relational operator is followed by two operands (which are each prefaced by
  a special separator string: the default separator value is <b>--&gt;</b>).
<p>
<ul>
<li>Command: <b>c-->operand</b><br>
    Execute <b>operand</b> as a Python statement; it is an Error if the
      statement raises any exception.
    An example might be <b>c-->from math import factorial</b> or
      <b>c-->x = [1,2,3,4,5]</b>.
<p>
<li>Evaluate: <b>e-->operand1-->operand2</b><br>
    Evaluates <b>operand1</b> as a Python expression, converts it to a string,
      and determines whether or not it is the same string as <b>operand2</b>;
      it is an Error if the strings are not equal or evaluating <b>operand1</b>
      raises an exception (<b>operand2</b> must be present, but it is just a
      string and therefor not evaluated).
    An example might be <b>e-->factorial(5)-->120</b>, which would not be an
      Error; but <b>e-->factorial(2,5)-->120</b> and
      <b>e-->factorial(5)-->110</b> would both be Errors: the first raises a
      <b>TypeError</b> exception and in the second <b>'120' != '110'</b>.
<p>
<li>Exception: <b>^-->operand1-->operand2</b><br>
    Executes <b>operand1</b> as a Python statement and determines whether or not
      an exception is raised matching <b>operand2</b> (either a single
      exception name, a list of exception names separated by commas, or
      <b>*</b> which means any exception name); there is an Error if no
      exception is raised or an exception not named by <b>operand2</b> is
      raised.
    An example might be <b>^-->factorial(-1)-->ValueError</b>, which would
      not be an Error; but <b>^-->factorial(2)-->*</b> and
      <b>^-->factorial(-1)-->TypeError,ZeroDivisionError</b> would both be
      Errors: the first raises no exception and the second raises a
      <b>ValueError</b> exception, which is neither <b>TypeError</b> nor
      <b>ZeroDivisionError</b>.
<p>
<li>Relational Operator: <b>relop-->operand1-->operand2</b><br>
    Evaluates <b>operand1</b> and <b>operand2</b> as Python expressions,
      and determines whether the <b>relop</b> holds between them; it is
      an Error if <b>relop</b> does not hold or evaluating either operand
      raises an exception.
    An example might be <b>==-->2*3-->3*2</b>, which would not be an
      Error; but <b>in-->'a'-->['b','c','d']</b> would be an Error: the
      character <b>'a'</b> is not in the list <b>['b','c','d']</b>.
    <p>
    Can you explain why <b>e-->2*3-->3*2</b> would be an Error?
    Can you explain why <b>in-->a-->['a','b','c']</b> would be an Error?
<p>
<li>Comment: <b>#any text</b><br>
    Prints the line number and <b>#any text</b> on the console.
    Nothing is tested.
    So lines that begin with # are treated like comments.
</ul>
Given these formats write a test file and run the <b>batch_self_check</b>
   function (with the standard default arguments) on it.
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Use the Eclipse editor to create/modify data files too.
This is especially true if you are on a Mac.
<b>Do not use a Mac editor for data files</b>.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Write a test file named <b>bsc.txt</b> (the default file name) that does
      the following (each requirement translates into one line in the file, so
      the file should contain 22 lines total).
    I suggest that you incrementally write and test this file: it requires
      running the <b>facts.py</b> module only once: each time you update
      the <b>bsc.txt</b> file with another test, just reissue the <b>!</b>
      command (the original default) in the <b>Console</b>, without
      stopping/rerunning the <b>driver</b> function.
<ol>
<li>Imports the <b>factorial</b> function from the <b>math</b> module.
<li>Imports the <b>fact1</b> and <b>fact2</b> functions from the <b>facts</b>
       module.
<li>Comments that <b>fact1</b> is now being tested.
<li>Checks whether the call <b>fact1('a')</b> raises the <b>TypeError</b>
      exception (it doesn't).
<li>Checks whether the call <b>fact1(-1)</b> raises the <b>ValueError</b>
      exception (it doesn't).
<li>Checks whether the call <b>fact1(0)</b> returns the value <b>1</b>
       (it doesn't).
<li>Checks whether the call <b>fact1(5)</b> returns the value <b>120</b>
       (it doesn't).
<li>Checks whether the call <b>fact1(10)</b> returns the same value as
       <b>factorial(10)</b> (it doesn't).
<li>Checks whether the call <b>fact1(10)</b> returns the same value as
       <b>10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1</b> (it doesn't).
<li>Checks whether the call <b>fact1(100)</b> returns the same value as
       <b>100*fact1(99)</b> (it does, because both are 0).
<li>Comments that <b>fact2</b> is now being tested.
<li>Checks whether the call <b>fact2('a')</b> raises the <b>TypeError</b>
      exception (it does).

Programming assignments must be turned in on time: you can get partial credit
  for a partially completed assignment, but it must be turned in on time; I
  will accept no late homework unless you have an official excuse pre-arranged
  with me (and even then I will always want you to turn in whatever work you
  have completed by the due date/time).
In fact, there is another incentive to finish not only on time, but to
  <b>finish early</b>.
<p>
In all programming assignments, if you turn in everything at least 24 hours
  before it is officialy due, you will receive 1 point of extra credit.
If you turn it in 48 hours (or earlier), you will receive 2 points of extra
  credit.
(There is no more extra credit for early turn-ins; I recommend NOT turning it
  in more than 48 hours early.)
This is equivalent to almost half a grade improvement (e.g., C+ to B, or B to
  B+, or B+ to A-) on a 50 point assignment.
I expect most of the students to complete their assignments and submit them
  early, so they will receive some amount of extra credit; it adds up.
<p>
There are two main advantages to planning on finishing early.
First, if you run into a major problem, you will have extra time to solve it
  before the actual due date: and even experienced programmers frequently run
  into such problems.
Yes, this means you!
Second, and more importantly, if you are racing to finish before a deadline,
  stress levels can go through the roof, and you become less interested in
  learning the material (and the whole purpose of these programming assignments
  is to learn the material) and more interested in just getting finished.
If you do not learn the material, then you will be at a major disadvantage for
  subsequent programming assignments and tests, because of the cumulative
  nature of the material in this course.
Therefore, work on an aggressive schedule and plan to finish <b>every</b>
  assignment by Sunday or Monday evening (or even earlier).
<p>
Programming assignments sometimes also include an extra credit section worth
  1 point.
These are designed for students who finish early and want to continue exploring
  programming within the context of the assignment.
The points are to acknowledge, in a very small way, their extra effort.
<p>
This assignment has no special extra-credit section.
You can get extra credit on it only for an early dropoff.

<!-- Time Management -->

<td width ="20%"><b>Time Management</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
One of the hardest parts of being in college is learning how to manage your
  time.
Time management is especially important in programming courses (and in the real
  world, when you are working on complicated projects with hard deadlines).
The difference between good and bad time management can have a profound impact
  on how much you learn in this course, how well you perform in it, and how
  much effort you actually need to expend to do well.
<p>
Most programming assignments can be broken into a series of smaller tasks, each
  that can serve as a milestone; when solved in sequence, these tasks will
  complete the entire assignment.
<p>
Generally, it is best to spread out the work on a two-week assignment.
Most assignmnts become available on Tuesday morning; I recommend reading the
  assignment before/during lab, so that if you are unsure about any parts of
  it, you can ask relevant questions about them on the Forum; this reading
  might include examining and understanding code provided in the writeup.
You should start working on it during lab, and should plan to complete at
  least half the programming assignment by the next Tuesday lab.
You should try to finish it by late the following the week: if not by Friday,
  you can work over the weekend to finish it.
In a worst-case scenario you can use the lab on Tuesday to finish, asking
  final questions of the staff during that lab.
<p>
Some students look at an assignment and think that it is best done in one
  sitting.
If you can do so, great; but, if you plan to work this way, do the one sitting
  early, not the weekend before it is due.
In this way, if you are wrong about the amount of time that it will take, you
  will still have adequate time to complete the assignment.
<p>
Likewise, I have seen students who always spend Tuesday finishing the previous
  assignment, and not get around to looking at and starting the next one.
This starts them on a bad path for finishing the next assignment.
<p>
By meeting these time goals, you will both maximize what you learn and minimize
  your anxiety and the time that it takes for you to do the learning.
<p>
Remember that assignments must be turned in on time: you can get partial credit
  for a partially completed assignment, but it must be turned in on time; I
  will accept no late homework unless you have an official excuse pre-arranged
  with me (and even then I will always want you to turn in whatever work you
  have completed by the due date/time).
<p>
Finally, if you find yourself falling behind, seek help immediately (from me,
  the TA, the Lab Tutor, or even other students in the course -when
  appropriate).
When the real programs start, we will discuss in more detail what kind of help
  you can get legitimately, and what kind of help constitutes cheating.
