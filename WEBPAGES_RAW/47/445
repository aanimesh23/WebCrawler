<h1>Data Specific Analysis of String Sorting</h1>
<h2>Saumi Bandyopadhyay</h2>

<p>We consider the complexity of sorting strings in the model that
counts comparisons between symbols and not just comparisons between
strings. We show that for any set of strings S the complexity of sorting
S can naturally be expressed in terms of the trie induced by S. This
holds not only for lower bounds but also for the running times of
various algorithms. Thus this &ldquo;data specific&rdquo; analysis allows
a direct comparison of different algorithms running on the same data. We
give such &ldquo;data-specific&rdquo; analyses for various versions of
quicksort and versions of mergesort. As a corollary we arrive at a very
simple analysis of quicksorting random strings, which so far required
rather sophisticated mathematical tools. As part of this we provide
insights in the analysis of tries of random strings which may be
interesting in their own right.</p>
