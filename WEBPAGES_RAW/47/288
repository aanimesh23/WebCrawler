"<b>A Formal Evaluation of Data Flow Path Selection Criteria</b>,''</A>

<i>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</i>,
SE-15(11), November 1989.

<H2> Abstract </H2>

A number of path selection criteria have been proposed throughout the 
years. Unfortunately, little work has been done on comparing these 
criteria. To determine what would be an effective path selection 
criterion for revealing faults in programs, we have undertaken an 
evaluation of these criteria. This paper reports on the results of 
our evaluation of path selection criteria based on data flow relationships. 
We show how these criteria relate to each other, thereby demonstrating some
of their strengths and weaknesses. In addition, we suggest minor changes 
to some criteria that improve their performance. We conclude with a 
discussion of the major limitations of these criteria and directions 
for future research.
