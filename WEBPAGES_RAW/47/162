<H4>Introduction</H4>
</center>

<p align =justify >

Our <font color="blue">"Grid"</font> code is a very fast and efficient implementation of a classic problem of handling continuous range queries on top of s large number of moving objects. Even though the code has been implemented some time ago, we are unaware of any other solution that is faster.<br>
<br>
In the setup of the problem, the assumption is that one or multiple servers track the locations of moving-objects. 
The number of objects can be very high, e.g., millions. The users issue on top of 
the spatial domain a large number of <em>continuous</em> (monitoring) queries. 
Unlike one-time queries, continuous queries are executed over a certain period of time, 
updating their results as the situation changes and objects move. For location-based serves, 
continuous <em>range</em> query (CRQ) is one of the most important query types. 
The main challenge is to develop an <em>efficient</em> and <em>scalable</em> CRQ solution.<br> 
<br>
The traditional approach for processing CRQs is to build an index on the objects (data) 
and utilize it for the query processing. In a moving object environment that approach 
suffers from the need for frequent index updates and thereby often results in poor performance.<br>
<br>
To solve the efficiency and scalability challenges of the problem, we have proposed a 
novel algorithmic technique called Query Indexing (QI). Query Indexing relies on reversing 
the role of queries and data. Namely, a spatial index (QIndex) is built on the continuous queries, 
and no index is built on the objects (data). The query results are computed by issuing 
point-queries (i.e., the object locations) to the QIndex and finding matches between objects and queries.<br>
<br>
We have realized that the CRQ problem can (and should) be solved in-memory for moving objects. 
This is since by keeping only the necessary info in main memory and the rest on disk, 
the data fits into the memory of an average workstation.  We have showed that very different 
types of indexes perform better in memory. Specifically, we have developed the <b>Grid</b> indexing 
techniques for processing queries in moving object databases, resulting in 
orders of magnitude of improvement over competing strategies. 
Nowadays, of course, many research efforts use in-memory grid-based solutins as the norm.<br> 
<br>
An interesting aspect of our solution is that, unlike many other techniques, it does not 
impose many of the common constraints, such as restriction on object speeds and trajectories, 
making it of much wider applicability.
