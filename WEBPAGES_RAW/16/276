Persistent data structures:

- update operations (change data) and query operations (don't change data)
- each update creates and returns a new version of the data structure
- each query can specify a version, search that version instead of new

Partial persistence: only queries can specify version
	set of versions has linear structure
Full persistence: updates can also specify version to modify
	set of versions has branching (tree-like) structure
Confluent persistence: updates may combine information from mult. vers.
	set of versions has DAG structure


Simple example: fully persistent stack
    used e.g. in languages where function calls can be preserved as objects
	("continuations") and examined or resumed at a later time

    stack version represented by nil or stack object
    stack object has fields value,next

    def top(version):
	return version.value

    def pop(version):	# NOTE RETURNS VERSION NOT STACK TOP
	return stack.next

    def push(version,data):
	return stackobject(data,version)

Fully persistent priority queue
(partially persistent = not very different from unpersistent)
	use binary heap structure (balanced binary tree)
	BUT use explicit object for each tree node (not array layout)
	represent version => object at root of the tree

	each update => change single path on tree =>
		make new objects for each changed object
		=> O(log n) time
	ALSO HIGH SPACE PENALTY, O(LOG N) PER VERSION

Methods for persistence:
	(1) create new objects in oriented-structure (above)

		works when updates have good WORST CASE time
		can often handle full dynamism

		may have to create some new objects even when
		they don't change, in order to be able to get
		root object with correct version
		(e.g. pq insert low priority item)

	(2) "fat objects":
		each object in data structure stores history of
		its own versions

		every time a query accesses object info it looks
		at the version history to find what to do

		optimal space (proportional to # changes)
		very general (can treat each memory cell as object)
		time penalty O(fatness) per memory access

		hard to handle search structure for branching history =>
			works best for partial persistence
		(version = small integers, use van Emde Boas, O(log log n)
		time penalty)

	(3) let objects get a little fat (O(1) versions each)
		but replace them when they get too fat
		=> can be more space efficient without time penalty


Partially persistent search tree:
	base on red-black tree
	note red-black bits can be stored without persistence
		(used only for non-persistent updates, not queries)

	also: O(1) rotations per update

	partial fatness method:
		each tree node stores O(1) versions (e.g. <=4)
		of its left and right child pointers,
		each version marked with update time

		query: traverse down tree using version timestamps
		to tell which left/right pointer to follow

		update: perform normal red-black update in
		most recent version of tree

		when update changes red-black bits, just do it
		(not persistent)
	
		when update changes left/right pointers of node,
		make new version of node
		
		when would make too many versions in same node,
		replace node by copy, make new version of parent

	time per query: O(log n)
		[same as RB tree + version checking]

	time per update: O(log n)
		[follow path to root rebalancing]

	amortized space per update: O(1)

With more work, can be made fully persistent => better fully persistent PQ

Another application: planar point location
	O(n log n) preprocessing
	O(n) space
	O(log n) query time

General principles:

Full persistence mixes badly with amortization:
can repeat same bad update over and over

For both methods, space = # changes per update,
so prefer data structures where updates avoid making much change
