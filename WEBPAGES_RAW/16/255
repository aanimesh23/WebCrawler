Dynamic Speed Scaling to Manage Energy<br>
John Augustine </h2>
<p>
Energy consumed by a processor per unit time, P(<I>s</I>), varies with the 
speed <I>s</I> at which it is run in a convex manner. This has been exploited 
to reduce the energy consumption by slowing down the processor. The 
algorithms that are explained in this talk are based on the following 
model that captures this key aspect of energy minimization. Each job is 
to be executed between its arrival time and deadline by a single 
processor with variable speed. The processor running at speed <I>s</I> consumes 
energy per unit time P(s) = <I>s</I><sup><I> p</I></sup>, <I>p</I> &ge; 2. We are asked to schedule the 
jobs so that the total energy is minimized. The offline version can be 
solved optimally in polynomial time [1]. I will provide the algorithm 
and proof. [1] also provides an online algorithm with a competitive 
ratio between <I>p<sup> p</sup></I> and 2<sup><I>p</I>-1</sup> <I>p<sup> p</sup></I>. In a recent improvement, Bansal et 
al. in [2] have provided an online algorithm that has a competitive 
ratio of <I>p<sup> p</sup></I>. I will explain this algorithm and provide proof if time 
permits.
