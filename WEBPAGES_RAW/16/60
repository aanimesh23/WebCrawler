Geometric $k$-Shortest Paths
</h1>
<h2>
Tim Johnson
</h2>

<p>
We consider the problem of computing $k$ shortest paths in a
two-dimensional environment with polygonal obstacles, where the $j$th
path, for $j$ in $[1,k]$, is the shortest path in the free space that is
also homotopically distinct from each of the first $j-1$ paths. In fact,
we consider a more general problem: given a source point $s$, construct a
partition of the free space, called the $k$th shortest path map ($k$-SPM),
in which the homotopy of the $k$ shortest paths in a region has the same
structure.
