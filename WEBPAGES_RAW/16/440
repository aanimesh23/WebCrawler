  <p>Goal:<strong> Learn how to build a multi-touch system from existing components </strong></p>
  <div class="indentRight">
        <ul>
          <li>Requirements for the system:
            <ul>
              <li>It must run a Java program compiled in Eclipse using  <a href="http://www.mt4j.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page">MT4J</a>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Unless you have a better idea (check with Prof.) extend the &quot;advanced.drawing&quot; fingerpaint program that comes as an example with MT4J with some interesting feature. </li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>It must receive events from a TUIO server.
                <ul>
                  <li>Programs that run using MT4J have a TUIO server built-in. No additional work is necessary. If you are trying to recreate the demos from class with the flash applications, then you need to run the TUIO server that comes with Community Core Vision. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>It must receive multi-touch inputs from a live multi-touch device which you build. See <a href="http://ccv.nuigroup.com/">Community Core Vision </a>for software to do this from video.
                <ul>
                  <li>I want you to build one using one of the techniques that we showed in class, or something else that you can think of.</li>
                  <li>I want you to do more than just download an app that sends multi-touch input (although you can do that for testing if you want) </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Admin
            <ul>
              <li>This is a group assignment. Groups may be no bigger than 3 people.
                <ul>
                  <li>A recommended breakdown of assignments is:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Multi-touch person: Responsible for delivering multi-touch events to the system</li>
                      <li>Java person: Responsible for writing code that responds to multi-touch inputs</li>
                      <li>Systems Lead/ Integrator: Responsible for getting all the components to work together on one machine and creating the video to show the system working in the best possible light. </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Due date is 11/18 at 12am, late Wednesday night, early Thursday morning</li>
            <li>Demonstrate the system by video-capturing the system in operation. Target length of video is 4 minutes. </li>
            <li>Turn in a link to a web-page which has:
              <ul>
                <li>The names of the people in your group and a description of the work they did          </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>A link to the video of the system </li>
              <li>A 4-6 paragraph description of the components and architecture of your system including approprite citations. </li>
              <li>A link to the source code for your program.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>In a separate EEE quiz you will be required to independently grade the work of the other members of your group. This may have the effect of modifying their/your grade.
              <ul>
                <li>The self-evaluation quiz is located <a href="https://eee.uci.edu/quiz/Vx8fcnODJa">here</a>. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Rough grading
            <ul>
              <li>Group members all agreeeing that you did more or less than your share might send your grade up or down a notch              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>To get an A:
              <ul>
                <li>The java program must respond to multi-touch events in real-time. </li>
                <li>Finger-painting (or alternative) must be compelling</li>
                <li>Video must clearly demonstrate the system working </li>
                <li>There must be a mutli-touch device</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>To get a B:
              <ul>
                <li>The system might use recorded video for CCV instead of live input </li>
                <li>The system might have individual components that work but it doesn't work together</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>To get a C
              <ul>
                <li>The video also fails to show anything happening</li>
                <li>There are clear errors in the Java program   </li>
              </ul>
