	   Hello and welcome to my website! Who am I? Well it seems strange to have a personal website -- it feels like the "its all
	   about me page"... but I guess it is... If we are defined by what we do and what we enjoy then this is the definition of me.

	    I am a graduate student in the in the <A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu"> School of Information and Computer Science</a> at the

            Being a graduate student enables me to conduct research and teach.  The personal interactions in teaching and the ability to really look at problems in depth through
	    research are aspects of my work that I truly enjoy.  The driving force behind my work is the notion that in some small way I hope to be
	    able to make a difference in other people's lives.

	 	Although I enjoy my work... I also enjoy my spare time. Maintaining a balance is important to me. <br><br>
	  	My personal relationships are very important to me. I value the time I share with friends either hanging out at 
		coffeeshops, chatting on the phone, sharing a meal and good conversation or enjoying some activity together.
		When I have free time this usually becomes my first priority.  Other than that...<BR><BR>

                If you are into hardcore/metalcore my nephew, Tim Rousseau,is in a very popular and totally awesome band called <a href="http://www.suburbancrisis.net/mainframe.html">Suburban Crisis</a>.
		He's the really cute bass player on the far right (my unbiased opinion of course). They are a local
		band so if you happen to be in the Santa Barbara area check them out! <br><br>

		I'd have to say that Photography is one of those things
	 	that bring joy and peace to my life. I just love this world that has been given to us and I love to 
		take pictures of it.
	 	I think the best part of it is that it allows me to enjoy and focus on the beautiful details that would 
	 	otherwise would be overlooked in the hustle and bustle of my everyday life.

	I enjoy every aspect of photography from shooting & developing to matting & framing. 
	I also enjoy dabbling in Photoshop.<BR><br>
	I used to be a die-hard 35mm shutterbug, but since have learned the convenience and value of digital photography.  
	If you are interested in a digital camera I would recommend looking at 
	<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/">DPreview</a>
	for some really thorough, indepth and fair reviews of digital cameras. Personally, I love my Canon EOS 5 for my 35mm
	indulgence and for digital I use a 
	<a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=139&modelid=10464">Canon EOS 20D</a>. 
	The 20D combined with a 
	<a href = "http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consumer/consDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&oid=37472319">
	Epson Stylus Photo R800 printer</a> (which I highly recommend) has really fulfilled my shutterbug needs.<br><br> 
		
	I recently downloaded 
	<a href="http://picasa.google.com/index.html">Picasa 2</a> for organizing photos. Google has done
	a pretty good job with this product. Its freeware and has no pop-up ads :-).  For mac users, it is similar to iphoto
	so you are not missing much here, but for PC users this is a great way to organize and make minor adjustments to your 
	photos.  It also creates decent looking html for your photos fairly quickly.  Some features/drawbacks -- when you 
	make modifications to your photos in Picasa 2 it doesn't modify the photo directly -- it saves the modifications in a 
	different file (which only picasa 2 reads) - if you want them to be made to the photo you have to export your modified
	photos.  I think this is a good thing because you never inadvertantly mess up your original picture.  Some don't like
	this because they expect the changes to be made directly to their photo and not in some Picasa readable format.  Like 
	I said the easy go around in this is that you just export the photo directly.  I don't care for how it organizes your photos
	and doesn't allow you to make customizable folders - it just uses whatever folder name you've stored them in on your 
	harddrive - so if you use subfolders (as I do) it doesn't incorporate the parent folder names.  However, it does update
	your pictures automatically and scans your entire harddrive on setup for all image files (found some surprises in there) :-)
	<br><br>
	
	If you too have moved into the digital world and are unsure of what type of compact flash to buy, there are two good sites
	for comparison. 
	<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/articles/mediacompare/default.asp">DPReview</a> explains what the
	differences are and what to look for and 
	<A href="http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/multi_page.asp?cid=6007">Rob Galbraith</a> provides comparisons specific to each
	camera.  I found both these sites to be invaluable when making CF purchases.

	I have been studying Tae Kwon Do since 2000 and enjoy the "art" of martial arts. 
	I was hesitant at first because I don't like the idea of hitting (or kicking) someone.
	However, I found the focus on balancing mind, body and spirit to be a very valuable practice.

	I like the notion of all parts of the self working together in unison - it is really the joy and

	There are many sites on the web that teach chords and different variations, but <a href="http://chordfind.Com">ChordFind</a> is by

    	A few years ago I took up money folding as a hobby. Mostly I got started doing this because I purchased a book, 
	<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/187825751X/qid=1124231776/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-2008248-5202211?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">"The Buck Book"</A>,
	for a friend's daughter on her birthday.  She had a little difficutly learning some of the models so I learned them to 
	teach her how to fold them. </td></tr></table>

	I thought... ok these are pretty cute and started leaving them as tips for servers that
	were particularly good as kind of an extra thanks.  Also noticed that it really brightened the day of servers who
	were having a bad day.  Something so simple brings a smile on someone's face -- amazing!<br><br>
	I've learned many different models from those I've seen displayed in restaurants and shops, and even more from pictures
	and diagrams I've discovered on the web. I have also joined a yahoo group called 
	
	<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/moneyfolders_unite">"Money-folders Unite"</a> - 
	which I recommend to anyone who is interested in starting this strange hobby.  Be forwarned though - those 
	bucks add up! I would like to thank all those who post diagrams and participate in Money Folders Unite - you've all been
	very helpful in my pursuit of folding.<br><Br> 

	For a long time I mostly folded the Elephant (which I credit to my friend Essie who would always respond "the elephant, of course" when 
	asked what I should fold.  Despite efforts to learn new cool money folds - the elephant still remains the most popular.
