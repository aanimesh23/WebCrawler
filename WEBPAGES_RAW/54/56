You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing Java.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely before performing the action that it
  describes.
This document shows downloading and installing Java 8 on Windows 7 in
  Summer 2015.
You should download and install the latest Java.

<h2>Java</h2><p>

The following instructions were composed for installing Sun Java 1.8.0_60
  (aka Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 8, Update 60).
<b>The version you download may be newer.</b>
Note: Java is already installed as part of Mac OS X, so no further installation
  is necessary if you have recently purchased one of these machines.
You can determine whether you have the right version by typing
<p>
<b><pre>  java -version</pre></b>
<p>
to the unix command prompt on Mac OS X;
the response should be something like <b>java version "1.8.0_60"</b>; it does
  not have to be this exact update, but it needs to be at least <b>"1.8..."</b>

<p>
The Java download requires about 250 MB of disk space; keep it on your machine,
  in case you need to reinstall Java.
When installed, Java requires about an additional 550 MB of disk space.
