<H3>UCI is a great place, and here's how I think you can get the most out of 
it:</H3>

<ul>
<li>
Take every opportunity to become a good writer—not necessarily a 
literary writer, but a clear, cogent, persuasive writer.  Your success at 
anything you do as an educated person will depend on your ability to write 
coherently.  
  <p>This kind of good writing is made, not born; you have to work 
at it, practicing continually.  Classes that require written assignments 
and projects are a perfect opportunity to sharpen these skills; avoiding 
them is a cowardly mistake.</li>
<p>
<li>
Read everything you can get your hands 
on—not just textbooks, but fiction, magazines, and newspapers.  Reading 
will help you become a better writer, and will widen your knowledge far 
beyond what you can experience personally.  
<p>Instead of watching the TV 
news, read the newspaper; instead of entertainment TV, read an entertaining 
novel.  
<p>Someone who doesn't read is hardly better off than someone who 
can't read.</li>
<p>
<li>
Take as wide a variety of courses as you can—not just in 
your major, but from every corner of the campus.  
<p>You should use your 
undergraduate years as an opportunity to learn about the world, about the 
achievements and diversity of humanity.  After you graduate, you will find 
yourself concentrating more on your career and your family, but while 
you're here at UCI, it couldn't be easier: Just sign up for a course, be it 
botany, Russian drama, art history, or Chinese politics.  
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of UCI's 
greatest strengths is its diversity; take advantage of it, and good 
luck!</p>
