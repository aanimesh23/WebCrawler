        Computers and communications technologies have changed
        the world.  From command-and-control systems to
        control of our automobiles, these technologies play a vital role. This
        revolution is only a few decades old, but already
        futurists talk about the twenty-first century in terms
        of the ``information economy,'' the ``information
        society,'' and even the ``information age.'' UCI's
    Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Science is in the center of this revolution,
    with programs of instruction and research in a variety
    of areas within computer science technology.

<H2> Educational Philosophy </H2>

 I assume my students want to learn.  True learning requires hard work.
 I motivate my students to learn with lots of course work including weekly
 homeworks, weekly quizzes, and a comprehensive final exam.  My role is
 to define what I want students to learn then to help them understand
 and learn that material.  I try to balance theory and practice so
 students can see the value of what they are learning.  I
 convey enthusiasm for the material in lecture and I'm sure my
 students can sense that I love my job and that I really care about
 their futures.  I've been very honored to receive fifteen UCI teaching
 awards over the past thirty years of UC teaching.
