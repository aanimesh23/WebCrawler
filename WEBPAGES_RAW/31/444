Here is some pseudo-code for Selection Sort.
My version keeps the right portion of the array sorted and
inserts items a[n-2] down to a[0]
The version most commonly seen keeps the right portion of the
array sorted and inserts items a[2] through a[n-1]

InsertionSort:

/* a[0] to a[n-1] is the array to sort */

// items a[i+1] through a[n-1] are assumed to be sorted.
// inserting item a[i] in it's correct place
for ( i = n-2; i >= 0; i-- )
{
    // save item to be inserted
    save = a[i];
    
    j = i+1;
    // going from left to right, move items over if they are less than save
    while( j < n && a[j] < save )
    {
        a[j-1] = a[j];
        j++;
     }
     
     // put save in its correct location
     a[j-1] = save;
}


This version from Wikipedia is close to what I presented in class:

/* a[0] to a[n-1] is the array to sort */
int iPos;
int iMin;
 
/* advance the position through the entire array */
/*   (could do iPos < n-1 because single element is also min element) */
for (iPos = 0; iPos < n; iPos++)
{
  /* find the min element in the unsorted a[iPos .. n-1] */
 
  /* assume the min is the first element */
  iMin = iPos;
  /* test against all other elements */
  for (i = iPos+1; i < n; i++)
    {
      /* if this element is less, then it is the new minimum */  
      if (a[i] < a[iMin])
        {
          /* found new minimum; remember its index */
          iMin = i;
        }
    }
 
  /* iMin is the index of the minimum element. Swap it with the current position */
  if ( iMin != iPos )
  {
    swap(a, iPos, iMin);
  }
}
