<h4>General Information</h4>
<p>Students requesting admission into the Information &amp; Computer Science second baccalaureate degree must satisfy all requirements <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">prior</span></strong> to applying. Applications for a second baccalaureate will not be considered until all required coursework is completed.</p>
<p><strong>Students whose first degree was from another institution other than UC Irvine:</strong></p>
<p>Applications will be accepted for the fall only. To ensure admission consideration for the fall or winter quarter, students should be sure to file their application by the UC deadline as indicated at www.admissions.uci.edu. Applications must be submitted to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools during the filing period. For more information on application procedures, please contact them at (949) 824-6703 or via the web at <a href="www.admissions.uci.edu">www.admissions.uci.edu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Students whose first degree was completed at UC Irvine:</strong></p>
<p>Applications will be accepted for any quarter. Former UC Irvine students must meet with an academic counselor to discuss admission for the second baccalaureate. Former UCI students will be admitted via the campus&#8217; readmission policy and must submit a completed UCI Readmission Form to the ICS Student Affairs Office in order to be considered for admission. All interested individuals must adhere to the readmission deadlines that are set by the Registrar&#8217;s Office. Admission for former UCI students will be processed throughout the academic year.</p>

<h4>Tips for Second Baccalaureate Applicants</h4>
<p>Applications cannot be acted upon until all required coursework is completed and relevant transcripts are received.</p>
<p>Course descriptions can be found in the <a href="http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue">UCI catalogue.</a>
</p>
<p>Required coursework may be completed at UCI or with equivalent courses taken at an accredited institution. Courses taken at a four-year or two-year institution can be examined by UC Irvine faculty through a petition process to determine equivalency. In order to determine equivalency, a course syllabus/outline, a course description and a textbook (if necessary) must be submitted to the ICS Student Affairs Office. </p>
<p>Courses may be taken at UCI through ACCESS UCI via University Extension. You can get more information by contacting them at (949) 824-5414 or via the web at <a href="http://www.unex.uci.edu">www.unex.uci.edu</a>. </p>
<p>Courses taken at universities other than local community colleges should be evaluated for equivalency before submitting your application; this way you know you have completed all relevant coursework. Articulation agreements between California community colleges and the Bren School of ICS can be found at <a href="http://www.assist.org">www.assist.org</a>.</p>
<p>Grade point averages as stated in the policy are required. If you complete several math and computer science courses and find you are not earning high enough grades, you may need to reconsider your decision to apply for a second baccalaureate degree in ICS. You may decide not to finish the required course work if you will not be able to get into ICS. The academic counselors in ICS are available to discuss your chances of being admitted to the program and to help you to identify other options.</p>

<h4>Special Programs and Learning Opportunities</h4>
<p>
			  There are several ways to add depth, scope, and experiential 
learning to your academic program of study. An academic counselor will 
help you determine the most efficient way to add another major, minor, 
or concentration to your academic plan, and will refer you to other 
campus programs and resources that support your interests and future 
goals.
			  </p>
<p><strong><span><strong>&#187;</strong></span> CONCENTRATIONS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<br/>
<li><strong>Engineering and Computer Science in the Global Context</strong><br/>
 
<i><br/>
All Bren School majors in good standing may propose an academic plan 
that demonstrates the ability to complete the concentration and other 
requirements for graduation in a reasonable timeframe.</i>
<p>
The globalization of the marketplace for information technology services
 and products makes it likely that Bren ICS graduates will work in 
multicultural settings or be employed by companies with extensive 
international operations, or customer bases.  The goal of the 
concentration is to help students develop and integrate knowledge of the
 history, language and culture of a country or geographic region outside
 the United States, through coursework both at UCI and an international 
host campus, followed by a technology related internship in the host 
country.
</p>
<strong>Application:</strong><br/>
Each student's proposed program of study, specifying coursework and a 
guided internship experience in a region outside the U.S., must be 
approved in advance by the Bren School of ICS Associate Dean for Student
 Affairs.  It is expected that each student's proposal will reflect a 
high degree of planning that includes the guidance of academic 
counselors and those at the UCI Center for International Education 
regarding course selection, as well as considerations related to 
internship opportunities, housing and financial aid.  The academic 
counselors and the Associate Dean will be available to assist qualified 
students with the development of a satisfactory academic plan, as 
needed.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Requirements:</strong><br/> 
<ol type="A">
<li><span>A
 minimum of eight courses at UCI or at the international campus with an 
emphasis on the culture, language (if applicable and necessary), 
history, literature of the country that corresponds to the international
 portion of the program, international law, international labor policy, 
global issues, global institutions, global conflict and negotiation and 
global economics; </span></li>
<li><span>A
 one or two semester sequence of technical courses related to the major 
and, possibly, cultural, history, and literature courses taken at an 
international university;</span></li>
<li><span>A two month or longer technical internship experience in the same country as the international educational experience.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<strong><span><strong>&#187;</strong></span> MINORS</strong>
<p>
Students inside and outside of the Bren School of ICS may want to pursue
 a minor, a coordinated set of courses which together take a student 
well beyond the introductory level in an academic field, subject, and/or
 discipline.  Note:  Some minor requirements may be fulfilled by the 
student&#8217;s major requirements.  Some major/minor combinations are not 
allowed.
