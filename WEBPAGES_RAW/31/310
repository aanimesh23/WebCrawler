"<B>Q: A Multi-lingual Interprocess Communications System for Software
Environment Implementation</B>"</A>, by Mark J. Maybee, Dennis H.

Colorado, Boulder.

<H2> Abstract </H2>

This paper describes the motivation for, design and implementation of,
and experience with, Q, a set of matched C and Ada interfaces designed
to support interprocess communication between these two languages.
Q's interfaces are adapted from the remote procedure call interface
model.  Certain of these adaptations were ncessitated by the lack of
key C language features in the Ada language.  Additional features were
inspired by language features present in Ada that are not commonly
found in C implementations.  Q defines an interprocess communication
model common to both languages, and a type space common to both
languages.  Q has evolved and been improved as a consequence of its
application and use.
