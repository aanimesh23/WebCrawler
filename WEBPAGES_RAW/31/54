Title: 
Planar and Poly-Arc Lombardi Drawings
</h2>

<p>
Abstract: 
In Lombardi drawings of graphs, edges are represented as circular
arcs and
the edges incident on vertices have perfect angular resolution.
However,
not every graph has a Lombardi drawing and not every planar graph has
a
planar Lombardi drawing. We introduce k-Lombardi drawings, in which
each
edge may be drawn with k circular arcs; we show that every graph has
a
smooth 2-Lombardi drawing and every planar graph has a smooth planar
3-Lombardi drawing. We also investigate related topics connecting
planarity and Lombardi drawings.
