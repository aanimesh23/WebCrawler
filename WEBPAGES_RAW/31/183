<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
We investigate learning a set of causally related concepts from examples.  We
show that human subjects make fewer errors and learn more rapidly when the set
of concepts is logically consistent.  We compare the results of these subjects
to subjects learning equivalent concepts that share sets of relevant features,
but are not logically consistent.  We present a shared-task neural network
model simulation of  the psychological experimentation.
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
Researchers have investigated how the relevant background knowledge of the
learner influences the speed or accuracy of concept learning (e.g., Murphy
&amp; Medin 1985, Nakamura 1985, Pazzani 1991, Wattenmaker <i>et al.</i> 1986).
However, the psychological investigation to date has only explored problems
where subjects learn a single concept and the relevant background knowledge is
either brought to the experiment by the subject or given in written
instructions.  In contrast,  research in machine learning has addressed issues
that occur when learning a set of related concepts.  For example, relevant
background concepts might be learned inductively from examples before learning
concepts that depend upon this knowledge (Pazzani 1990).  Here, we report on
two experiments in which subjects induce the relevant background knowledge from
examples and use this background knowledge to facilitate later learning.  The
experiments illustrate the importance of learning the relevance of combinations
of features, rather than individual features.  We model this experiment with
shared-task neural networks (Caruana, 1993).  <p>
In the first experiment,  subjects first induce the relevant background
knowledge and then have the opportunity to use this knowledge in later
learning.  To more closely simulate the real world, we ran a second experiment
wherein the subjects induce the relevant background knowledge at the same time
as learning the concept that depends on this knowledge.  In both experiments,
subjects were divided into two groups.  One group, the "feature consistency"
group, learned a complex concept that shared relevant features with previously
learned related concepts, but was not logically consistent with those concepts.
Another group, the "logical consistency" group, learned a complex concept that
was logically consistent with previously learned related concepts. <b></b>
<h2>
Initial Psychological Experimentation</h2>
In the first experiment,  subjects were asked to imagine that they work for the
US Forest Service and were assigned the task of learning to predict years in
which there is a severe risk of forest fire danger in the fall.  Four concepts
had to be learned in the experiment -- one concept in each of four phases.  All
subjects learned the same 3 background concepts in phases 1-3.  Then,  for
phase 4, they were divided into two groups (the logical consistency group and
the feature consistency group) to learn one of two separate concepts which
depended on the background concepts.<p>
The first phase of the experiment was designed to minimize the effects of the
subjects' domain-specific pre-existing theories by having every subject learn
the same concept.  In this first phase, subjects had to learn when there is a
severe risk of forest fires in the fall given data on rain in the spring and
summer. An example of these data is shown in Figure 1.  Subjects were given
data that indicated that there is a severe risk of forest fires in the fall
only when there is both a wet spring and a dry summer.  This rule is consistent
with the knowledge of most people who live in Southern California. In the
remaining phases, when we measure the learning rate and number of errors made
by subjects,  novel stimuli are used as features to insure that the knowledge
was acquired during the experiment.<p>

Next, the subjects were told that the US Forest Service needs to do advance
planning, so it cannot wait until the end of summer to predict when there will
be a severe risk of fire in the fall.  The subjects again examined data from
several years.  This time, however, the data was from five simulated scientific
instruments that are used each January to detect the presence of factors that
may be useful in predicting the amount of rain.  When one of the instruments
detects the presence of a particular factor, it displays a distinctive graph,
as shown in Figure 2.  Otherwise, a bar is shown to mark the absence of the
instrument's graph (see Instrument 3 of Figure 2)  Each instrument displays a
graph whose shape differs from that of the other instruments.   In this second
concept learning problem, subjects had to learn to predict from the instrument
readings when there would be a rainy spring.  All subjects were given data that
indicated there would be a wet spring when one particular instrument showed a
distinctive graph.  All subjects learned a rule of the form "There will be a
wet spring when Instrument-A displays a graph," with the instrument
corresponding to Instrument-A selected randomly.  This concept will serve as
background knowledge for learning the fourth concept.<p>

third and fourth concepts.

In the third concept learning problem, subjects learned another piece of
background knowledge.  Here, subjects had to learn to predict from the
instrument readings when there would be a dry summer.  All subjects were shown
data derived from the rule "There will be a dry summer when Instrument-B or
Instrument-C  displays a graph."<p>
In the fourth, and final, concept learning problem, subjects had to learn to
predict from the instrument readings when there would be a severe risk of fire
in the fall.  Concepts 1-3 served as background knowledge for this concept.
Subjects in the logical consistency group were given data that indicated there
would be a severe risk of fire when Instrument-A displayed a graph and when
either Instrument-B or Instrument-C (or both) displayed a graph, i.e., A
and (B or C).  This concept is logically consistent with
the first three concepts that were learned.  Subjects in the feature
consistency group were given data that indicated there would be a severe risk
of fire when Instrument-C displayed a graph and when either Instrument-B or
Instrument-A (or both) displayed a graph, i.e. C and (B
or A).  Although not consistent with the concepts that were learned,
this concept shares relevant features with the logical consistency concept.
<b><p>
Subjects. </b>The subjects were 18 male and female undergraduates attending the
University of California, Irvine who participated in this experiment to receive
extra credit in an introductory psychology course.  <b><p>
Stimuli. </b>The stimuli consisted of data that were displayed on a computer
monitor. In the first concept, since there are two two-valued features, 4
distinct stimuli were constructed.  In the remaining three concepts, there were
32 distinct stimuli since there are five two-valued features.  The stimuli were
presented in a random order for each subject.<b><p>
Procedures.</b> Each subject was shown data on the computer from a single year
and asked to make a prediction (e.g., whether there would be a severe risk of
fire in the fall) by clicking on a circle next to the word Yes or a circle next
to the word No (i.e., using a mouse to move a pointer to the circle and
pressing a button on the mouse).  Next, the subject clicked on a box labeled
Check Answer. While still displaying the data, the computer indicated to the
subject whether his answer was the correct answer.  If the subject's answer was
correct, the subject could click on a box labeled Continue and data from
another year was shown.  Otherwise, he selected a different answer and clicked
on Check Answer again.  This process was repeated until the subjects performed
at a level that ensured they had learned an accurate approximation to the
concept (making no more than one error in any sequence of 24 consecutive
trials).  The subjects were allowed as much time as they wanted to make their
prediction and to view the data after the correct answer was shown.  This
process of learning a concept to criteria was repeated for each of the four
concepts learned.  We recorded the number of the last trial on which the
subject made an error, the total number of errors made by the subject for each
concept, and the number of made on each block of 16 trials.  If the subject did
not obtain the correct answer after 96 trials, we recorded that the last error
was made on trial  96.  <b><p>
Results. </b>Subjects in the logical consistency group required an average of
27.6 trials to learn the fourth concept, while subjects in the feature
consistency group required an average of 50.4 trials t(16) = 1.91,  p &lt; .05.
Subjects in the logical consistency group made an average of 6.8 errors, while
subjects in the feature consistency group made an average of 14.0 errors t(16)
= 2.135, p &lt; .05.<b>  </b>
<h2>
 Multiple Concept Learning</h2>
In Experiment 1, subjects accurately induced three relevant background
concepts, prior to learning a single concept which depended upon those
concepts.  The order of the concepts is the ideal order for subjects to first
acquire knowledge inductively and then use that knowledge in future learning.
However, the natural world does not have a benevolent teacher who orders
experiences for the learner.  To more closely simulate the natural world, in
the second experiment, those concepts that had the same stimuli from the first
experiment (the last three concepts) are learned at the same time.  For each
presentation of stimuli, subjects predicted whether there would be a rainy
spring, a dry summer, and a severe risk of fire in the fall (see Figure 3).
With this exception, Experiment 2 was identical to Experiment 1. For the second
learning phase, subjects had to click on all three boxes correctly before
proceeding to the next stimuli.  We recorded the number of the last trial on
which the subject made an error and the total number of errors made by the
subject only for the concept that involved predicting whether there would be a
severe risk of fire in the fall from the instrument data.  In addition, for
this concept, we also recorded the number of errors made by the subject on
blocks of 16 trials.  If the subject did not obtain the correct answer after
128 trials, we recorded that the last error was made on trial 128.<p>

  <b>Results.  </b>The subjects in the logical consistency group required an
average of 77.8 trials to predict whether there would be a severe risk of fire
in the fall from the instrument data, while subjects in the feature consistency
group required an average of 109.9 trials t(16) = 1.81, p &lt; .05.  In
addition, subjects in the logical consistency group made an average of 29.3
errors, while subjects in the feature consistency group made an average of
41.4. errors.  This last figure is marginally significant t(16) = 1.41, p &lt;
.1.<b>  </b>The results demonstrate that simultaneously learning a set of
related concepts is easier when the concepts are logically consistent than when
the concepts merely share a set of relevant features.  Figure 4 graphs the
percentage of errors made by the two groups at predicting a severe risk of fire
in the fall from the instrument data as a function of the number of trials.  It
shows that subjects in logical consistency and feature consistency groups
perform similarly until trial 64. After this point, subjects in the logical
consistency group make fewer errors than those in the feature consistency
group. <p>

<h2>
Discussion</h2>
There are three findings of note in these experiments. First, subjects in the
logical consistency condition make fewer errors and require fewer trials to
learn.  While this finding agrees with our intuition on how people should
learn, previous experiments involving background knowledge have not had
subjects learn this background knowledge.   Furthermore, current cognitive
models do not perform in this manner and there is no quantitative data on how
background knowledge that is learned  inductively influences the learning rate
and number of errors made by learners. <p>
Second, learning the relevance of individual features cannot account for these
findings. Wisniewski and Medin (1994) use  the term selection models to refer
to learning models that use prior knowledge to determine which features are
relevant. Lien and Cheng (1989) present one such model.  Selection models would
not be able to explain the results since both the logical consistency and
feature consistency groups learn concepts with the same relevant features. <p>
Third, although the subjects in the logical consistency group learn faster and
make fewer errors than subjects in the feature consistency group, they learner
slower and make more errors than would be predicted by existing computational
models of the influence of prior knowledge such as Explanation-based learning
(EBL) (Mitchell <i>et al.</i> 1986). EBL is a machine learning method that
derives concepts from background knowledge. At first, it might seem that EBL
would serve as an ideal model of the use of prior knowledge in learning. Its
inputs correspond exactly to those items learned in Phases 1-3 of the first
experiment, and its output correspond exactly to the concept to be learned in
Phase 4.  However, there are several problems with EBL as a model of human
learning.  First,  EBL algorithms would learn more quickly than the logical
consistency subjects.  Since the fourth concept can be deductively derived from
the preceding three, EBL would make no errors on this data. Second, EBL cannot
function unless the background knowledge is complete.  For example, EBL could
not acquire the concepts in Phases 2 and 3 since these are just associations
between stimuli and weather predictions.  
<h2>
Modeling with Shared-Task Networks</h2>
Here, we propose a model of the psychological experiments using multi-layer
neural networks trained with error backpropagation (Rumelhart <i>et al.</i>
1986) to learn multiple concepts.  First, we would like to make a distinction
between sub-task learning and shared-task learning.  In sub-task learning, some
of the concepts to be learned serve as background concepts for the other
concepts to be learned.  For instance, in poker, learning the hands <i>two
pair</i> and <i>one pair</i> is a sub-task problem because <i>one pair</i> is a
background concept for learning <i>two pair</i>.  Shared-task learning, on the
other hand, involves learning concepts that share subordinate concepts.  As an
example, learning both the hands <i>two pair</i> and <i>full house</i> require
knowing what <i>one pair</i> is, but <i>two pair</i> and <i>full house</i> do
not require knowledge of each other.<p>
The network diagrammed on the left side of Figure 5 shows a typical way of
using networks to learn sub-task concepts with the network applied to
Experiment 1.  (Please note that in order to make the diagrams more
comprehensible, only some of the connections between nodes are drawn.  In an
actual network, all the nodes of a hidden layer would be connected to all of
its input and output nodes.)  The network first learns the section enclosed in
the solid line.  The two inputs are analogous to the abstract features shown
our subjects in the first phase of the experiment.  The output is the network's
guess at whether or not there will be a severe risk of fire in the fall.
Second, the network is trained on the section enclosed in the dashed line.
This represents learning the Wet Spring concept.  The five inputs (A-E) on the
left represent the five instrument displays shown to the human subjects.  The
output is the network's prediction at whether there will be a wet spring.
Third, the Dry Summer concept is trained on the network section enclosed in the
dotted line.  The same five inputs are used as were used to learn the previous
concept.  The output is the network's guess at whether there will be a dry
summer.  The wet spring and dry summer concepts are the sub-tasks the network
learns.  The final Fire in the Fall concept is represented by training and
testing on the entire network.  The network uses the five inputs to decide if
there will be a severe risk of fire in the fall.<p>

learning model.  The network on the right is a shared-task learning model. 
<hr>
A system such as KBANN (Towell <i>et al.</i> 1990) could set up a network like
the one on left side of Figure 5, given symbolic inferences rules that
represent the knowledge acquired in the first three phases of the experiment. A
problem with this method in modeling the experiment is that since the network
would already be trained on the three background concepts, it would not require
any training to learn the final concept in the logical consistency group of our
experiment.  This is the same problem that EBL suffers from.<p>
Caruana (1993) has done work on shared-task learning using networks with one
hidden layer.  The network on the right of Figure 5 is a representation of such
a network.  A major advantage of this model is that the hidden layer can create
new features which can be shared by all of the output units.  To model the
first experiment, the network first uses the five inputs and only the Wet
Spring output unit is trained, i.e., receives feedback on its performance.
Second, the same five inputs are used, but only the Dry Summer output unit is
trained.  Third, the Fire in the Fall output unit is trained and tested using
the five inputs.  <p>
We performed experiments with shared-task neural nets to see if they could
model the results from our psychological experiments since it appeared that
this method could learn the combinations of features in addition to feature
relevancy.  These networks might also be able to combine features and store the
combination in the network just as it stores learned knowledge. In both
experiments, the first phase used 2 abstract features as stimuli while the
later phases used 5 instrument displays.  Since the network cannot learn
concepts with different forms of inputs, it cannot be trained on the first
phase.  However, the network can be used to learn the other phases of the
experiments. To model the sequential experiment (Experiment 1), the network
first uses the 5 inputs and only the Wet Spring output unit is trained, i.e.,
receives feedback on its performance.  Second, the same 5 inputs are used, but
only the Dry Summer output unit is trained.  Third, the Fire in the Fall output
unit is trained and tested using the 5 inputs.  Modeling the simultaneous
experiment (Experiment 2)is done by training all 3 of the output nodes at the
same time, but only using the Fire in the Fall unit for testing.<p>
The logical form of the data was the same as used in the psychological
experiments.  The first output unit had a value of one when one random feature,
say A, had a value of 1.  The second output unit had a value of 1 when either
(or both) of two other randomly selected features, say B and C, had values of
1.  To model the logical consistency group, the third output unit had a value
of 1 when feature A had a value of 1 and either feature B or feature C (or
both) had a value of 1, i.e. A and (B or C).  The network
used was a feed-forward system with one layer of 20 hidden units.  The
generalized delta rule was used for training and the logistic function was used
for activation.  At testing, a network output value greater than 0.5 was
treated as a 1 and a value below  0.5 was treated as a 0 to model the forced
guessing that was applied to the human subjects.  Momentum was set at 0.90 and
the learning rate was set at 0.25.<p>
To model Experiment 1, we trained the network to sequentially learn each of the
3 concepts: wet spring, dry summer, and fire in the fall.  We first trained the
network to learn when an example was a positive example of the wet spring
concept, i.e. when the first output unit would have a value of 1 as a function
of the 5 features.  After each epoch through the training data, the network was
tested to see if it could correctly predict the value of the first output unit
on at least 31 of the 32 examples.  If it could, the network was then trained
on learning when the second output unit (dry summer) was true as a function of
the 5 features.  If it could not reliably predict the first feature, it was
trained on another epoch through the data.  After it had learned to reliably
predict the second output unit, it was trained to predict the third output unit
- the fire in the fall concept.  Data was recorded on how many epochs the
network took to learn the final concept.  The process of learning each concept
sequentially was repeated 50 times.<p>
The network required an average of 5.96 epochs, or 190.72 trials, to learn the
logical consistency set, while it took significantly longer, 8.50 epochs or
272.00 trials, to learn the feature consistency set, t(98) = 6.06, p &lt; .05.
Similar to the human subjects, this network sequentially learned the set of
concepts more easily when it was logically consistent than when the concepts
merely share features.  <p>
To model Experiment 2, we trained the network to simultaneously learn all three
concepts. The network was trained on all 3 of the concepts, but was tested only
on the third concept.  After each epoch through the training data, the network
was tested to see if it could correctly predict the value of the third feature
on at least 31 of the 32 examples.  If it could, then training stopped;
otherwise, it was trained for another epoch.  Data was kept on how many errors
the network made on each epoch and on which epoch the network learned the final
concept.  The process of learning the concepts was repeated 50 times.<p>
The neural net required an average of 7.12 epochs, or 227.84 trials, to learn
the logical consistency set, while it took significantly longer, 9.66 epochs or
309.12 trials, to learn the feature consistency set, t(98) = 5.039, p &lt; .05.
Similar to the human subjects, this network simultaneously learned the set of
concepts more easily when it was logically consistent than when the concepts
merely share features.  Figure 6 graphs the percentage of errors made on the
two sets as a function of the number of epochs.  It shows that after the second
epoch, the graph is similar to Figure 4.  On the logically consistent
condition, the network becomes accurate with fewer training epochs.<p>

<hr>
Shared task networks are able to model these results because they can create
new abstract features and use these features to influence learning other
concepts.  The network requires some training to determine how to use these
abstract features, but less training than would be required if new concepts
were not consistent with the concepts learned earlier. The shared task network
is an example of what Wisniewski and Medin (1994)  call a tightly coupled
model.  Prior knowledge, in this case created by prior learning, selects the
relevance of features (by having higher weights on some connections), and
creates new features (as represented in the hidden units).  Furthermore,
feedback during learning one concept can change the features or strengths of
the hidden units used by other concepts.  
<h2>
Conclusions</h2>
Although the general topic of learning a series of concepts has been discussed,
previous research has focused on attentional phenomena such as the
intradimensional and extradimensional shift in which subsequent concepts share
related features with prior concepts.  However, these approaches consider sets
of arbitrary groups of concepts rather than concepts that are causally related.
Waldmann and Holyoak (1990) argue that the causal induction process differs
from the learning process used to acquire arbitrary concepts.  In particular,
we show that concepts acquired by induction in one phase of an experiment
influence later learning in much the same manner as concepts acquired by
reading written instructions or  prior background concepts.<p>
We have focused on how prior knowledge facilitates learning. We should also
point out that incorrect prior knowledge may also hinder learning by providing
misconceptions (Chi, Slotta &amp; de Leeuw, 1994). It is only when prior
knowledge is compatible with the new knowledge to be acquired that we
anticipate a positive effect.<p>
Classical concepts that consistent of sets of necessary and sufficient features
have several flaws. Few concepts people encounter have such rigorous logical
definitions (Rosch, 1978).   More recently, it has become apparent that
concepts do not exist and are not learned in isolation. Here, we have presented
quantitative results on how induced background knowledge influence the rate of
learning and the number of errors made during learning.  While we have found
that having relevant, correct background knowledge facilitates learning, it
does not eliminate the need for learning. That is, unlike previous learning
models, when subjects have learned rules corresponding to  "A -&gt; WetSpring,"
"B or C -&gt;  DrySummmer" and "WetSpring and DrySummmer
-&gt;  FireInFall"  they do not automatically know that  "A and (B
or C) -&gt;  FireInFall."  We believe that one flaw in previous
learning models that use prior knowledge is that the equate an explanation with
a logical proof, and use rules that have necessary and sufficient
preconditions.  Such rules may be as rare in the real world and as cognitively
implausible as concepts that consistent of necessary and sufficient
definitions.
