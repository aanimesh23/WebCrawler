<h1>What is traceability?</h1>

<p>
There seem to be a number of closely-related kinds of traceability
and ways of defining it.&nbsp;
For the purposes of this class,
<dfn>traceability</dfn> is relative to a written document or documents,
and refers to the ability to determine what the consequences
of each decision are, and where the consequences are located in the document;
and what the reasons and rationales for each decision are,
and where the reasons are located in the document.&nbsp;
We will often use traceability to refer to
the <i>means</i> by which consequence and reasons are located.&nbsp;
Traceability of consequences is <dfn>forward traceability</dfn>
and traceability of reasons in <dfn>backward traceability</dfn>.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
Forward and backward traceability correspond, in the simplest case,
to forward and backward in time as well.&nbsp;
In a waterfall model,
each choice is made before the choices that result from its consequences
are made.&nbsp;
In practice,
this usually doesn't happen
because the decision process involves a lot of backtracking.&nbsp;
We don't see the full consequences of a decision
until we've explored them and made some decisions based on them.&nbsp;
Often an earlier decision (in the traceability sense)
is made on the basis of a later consequence &mdash;
for example,
we may change a system's goals
when we discover that the code doesn't run fast enough.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
I extend traceability to include <i>rejected alternatives</i>,
and term this <dfn>sideways traceability</dfn>.&nbsp;
While it is possible to make a statement that is simply
the first one that occurred to you,
such a one cannot be classed as a thoroughly considered and supported statement.&nbsp;
Every statement is (implicitly or explicitly)
a choice from among two or more alternatives,
the others of which were rejected for some reason or other.&nbsp;
The chosen statement is supported not only by
the reasons and rationales behind it,
but also by the thoroughness indicated by
the range and breadth of rejected alternatives,
and their rationales, which were deemed less convincing for specific causes.&nbsp;
</p>


<h1>Why is traceability valuable and interesting?</h1>

<p>
One way of viewing traceability is to think of it as a goal
using a metaphor of vision:&nbsp;
the goal of having reasons and rationales,
considered but rejected alternatives,
and consequences all visible
from the point at which a decision is recorded.&nbsp;
The advantages of traceability are several, including:&nbsp;
</p>

<ol class='oa'>
  <li>
    The previous work of inference and reasoning
    is not lost, but can be reviewed and reused.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    It is available when each decision
    is reconsidered
    (for example, as the system's conception evolves).&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    It is available
    when a neophyte is first learning about the system
    and why it is the way that it is.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    If a previously rejected alternative
    is elevated to primacy later,
    at least some of its reasons, rationales, and consequences
    are already present,
    as are the reasons, rationales, and consequences
    of the newly rejected choice.&nbsp;
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
How to achieve traceability?&nbsp;
In general,
it has to be specifically supported.&nbsp;
Except for the very smallest requirements specifications,
there is too much information
for a person to have it all in their head.&nbsp;
Some way of finding it with assistance is needed.&nbsp;
</p>


<h1>How is traceability supported?</h1>

<p>
The most straightforward way
is to do it directly:&nbsp;
put as much of the traced-to information as possible
right there with the statement,
and put pointers to the rest.&nbsp;
This works best with rationales and rejected alternatives,
because a set of rationales and rejected alternatives
usually corresponds to a single statement
and this correspondence doesn't change over time
(although the chosen alternative may).&nbsp;
It is more problematic with the pointers,
typically called <dfn>links</dfn> in this context.&nbsp;
These links ramify quickly,
often change over time
(because a change in a choice usually corresponds to
a change in the reasons the choice is based on,
and a change in the consequences of the choice),
and have to be maintained both forward and backward.&nbsp;
In practice, the links frequently deteriorate in salience
as the decisions evolve and the links are not evolved along with them.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
Because updating the traceability links
is time-consuming and tedious,
and thus is error-prone and usually incomplete,
it is tempting to think of other more flexible approaches.&nbsp;
Several commercial products support the construction and maintenance
of traceability links.&nbsp;
One might imagine
using a sophisticated search capability instead of maintained links,
so that the connections could be easily
rediscovered and regenerated only as needed,
rather than updated whenever they change.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
For the purposes of this course,
we will use explicit links,
not because they are necessarily the most effective approach,
but because they are the most effective in
showing your understanding.&nbsp;
</p>


<h1>Traceability and consistency</h1>

<p>
Traceability is related to <dfn>consistency</dfn>,
the problem of making a document
not state contradictory things.&nbsp;
One way of supporting consistency
is to divide the decisions so that they are orthogonal
and do not interfere with each other,
and then state each decision exactly once
("a place for everything, and everything in its place"),
and instead of repeating the statement,
reference it instead.&nbsp;
Taken to the extreme,
this approach ensures consistency
because each thing is only said once,
therefore there are no other statements of it
that could be inconsistent.&nbsp;
In practice, partitioning the decisions so they are orthogonal
is impractical.&nbsp;
However,
it is still beneficial to state each decision only once
and reference it instead of restating it.&nbsp;

  </p>
</div>


<h1>The relations among kinds of information</h1>

<p>
In general, there is a traceability progression
from stakeholders through goals and requirements to scenarios:&nbsp;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    each stakeholder has at least one goal
    (forward)
  </li>
  <li>
    each goal belongs to at least one stakeholder
    (backward)
  </li>
  <li>
    each goal is supported by other goals
    or by one or more requirements
    (forward)
  </li>
  <li>
    each requirement supports at least one goal
    (backward)
  </li>
  <li>
    each requirement is operationalized by at least one scenario
    (forward)
  </li>
  <li>
    each scenario operationalizes at least one goal
    (backward)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
And in general, all of the above have rationales and rejected alternatives,
and everything is supported by the elicitation data:&nbsp;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    stakeholders, goals, requirements, and scenarios\
    each have a rationale (backward)
    and one or more rejected alternatives
    (sideways)
  </li>
  <li>
    everything is directly or indirectly connected to
    an elicitation datum that is its foundation
    (backward)
  </li>
  <li>
    each elicitation datum supports at least one thing
    (forward)
  </li>
</ul>
