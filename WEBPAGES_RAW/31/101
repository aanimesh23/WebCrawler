The authors give an    algorithm to solve this problem. The strategy is to pack disks such that    the disk centers induce a mixed triangulation/quadrangulation respecting    the boundary of the polygon. The algorithm is based on results by R.    J.

Consequently, linear time approximation schemes for several    optimization problems on these graphs are obtained, as are linear time    algorithms for subgraph isomorphism and induced subgraph isomorphism.}}Dihedral bounds for mesh generation in high dimensions@article{BerCheEpp-AAMS-94,  title = {{Dihedral bounds for mesh generation in high dimensions}},  author = {Marshall Wayne Bern and L.

The author considers here a recent work of Bern, Mitchell    and Ruppert which uses circle packings to generate such meshes and speed    up a key step of their method in which circles are packed into a non-simply    connected polygonal region to connect its boundary components.         In the work of Bern et al., this step was computed in $O(n\log\sp {2}n)$    time. The new method presented here leads to an overall speedup of a    logarithmic factor, which makes the whole algorithm work in total time    $O(n\log n)$.         This method for connecting the boundary components of a polygon relies    on a combination of several known techniques such as: Voronoi diagrams,    minimum spanning trees, intersection graphs, neighborhood system algorithms    of Eppstein, Miller and Teng, and dynamic tree techniques of Sleator    and Tarjan.}}Faster construction of planar two-centers@techreport{Epp-TR-96-12,  title = {{Faster construction of planar two-centers}},  author = {David Eppstein},  address = {Irvine, CA, 92697-3425, USA},  institution = {Univ. of California, Irvine, Dept. of Information and Computer    Science},  number = {96-12},  year = {1996},  url = {http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/Epp-TR-96-12.pdf}}@inproceedings{Epp-SODA-97,  title = {{Faster construction of planar two-centers}},  author = {David Eppstein},  booktitle = {Proc. 8th Symp.

The author considers digraphs admitting self-loops,    multiple edges and cycles without negative lengths, and the paths are    not necessarily simple. Using an implicit representation of the paths,    the author presents, in detail, an algorithm with time complexity $O(m+n\log    n+k)$ where $n$ and $m$ are the number of vertices and the number of    edges of the digraph. This also leads to an algorithm of complexity $O(m+n\log    n+kn)$ for the $k$-shortest-paths problem from a given source $s$ to    all other vertices of the graph.         To get the implicit representation, one starts with a single-destination    $(t)$ shortest path tree $T$ of the given digraph $G$ with source $s$    and destination $t$ and produces a heap $H\sb G(v)$ at each vertex $v$    leading to a directed acyclic graph $D(G)$ and through that to a path    graph $P(G)$, with the property that there is a one-to-one "length-preserving"    correspondence between $s$-$t$ paths in $G$ and paths starting from the    root $r$ in $P(G)$ and finally to a 4-heap $H(G)$ whose nodes correspond    to the $s$-$t$ paths of $G$. After developing a basic algorithm, improvements    are introduced in the heap construction to attain the above complexity.            The improvements in time complexity achieved through this algorithm when    used for the dynamic programming applications to the following optimization    problems are discussed at some length: the knapsack problem, sequence    alignment, inscribed polygons, and genealogical relations. Three open    problems are suggested.}}Finding the $k$ smallest spanning trees@inproceedings{Epp-SWAT-90,  title = {{Finding the $k$ smallest spanning trees}},  author = {David Eppstein},  booktitle = {Proc. 2nd Scandinavian Worksh.

Most results on such    problems, especially theoretical ones, are restricted to the extension    of triangular meshes to tetrahedral meshes. However, in practice, quadrilateral    and hexahedral meshes are often preferred because of their numerical    properties. Few theoretical results are known for this case. For planar    meshes, it has been proved [S. Ramaswami, P. A. Ramos and G. T. Toussaint,    Comput. Geom. 9 (1998), no. 4, 257--276; MR 98k:68169] that a polygon    with $n$ sides can be meshed with convex quadrilaterals if and only if    $n$ is even. Moreover, $O(n)$ Steiner points suffice as the vertices    of the internal mesh, and they can be found efficiently. Thurston and    Mitchell independently proved a similar result for spatial meshes, but    it is restricted to solids whose boundaries are topological spheres.    The resulting internal mesh is only topological, not geometric, in the    sense that the hexahedral elements have curved boundaries and are not    necessarily convex. Moreover, the size of the internal mesh is not linear    in the size of the boundary mesh. In this paper, the author removes this    restriction and proves that any polyhedron which is topologically a sphere    and whose boundary is composed of an even number of quadrilateral faces    can be meshed with a linear number of topological cubes. The author has    made some progress in extending this proof to geometric meshes---only    a finite number of cases are left to be tested, and this could be done    by machine---but, as he points out, this extension would not be directly    practical because the size of the interior mesh may be large, albeit    linear, and its elements will be poorly shaped.}}Maintenance of a minimum spanning forest in a dynamic planar graph@techreport{EppItaTam-TR-90,  title = {{Maintenance of a minimum spanning forest in a dynamic planar    graph}},  author = {David Eppstein and Giuseppe F.

For any $d$-dimensional set of $n$ points there    exists a hyperplane having regression depth $\lceil\frac{n}{d+1}\rceil$.    Conjecture 2. For any point set there exist a partition into $\lceil    \frac{n}{d+1}\rceil$ subsets and a hyperplane that has nonzero regression    depth in each subset. The authors prove the first conjecture and make    some progress on the second. The problems arise in the context of robust    regression and have a natural geometric formulation. The proofs are based    on projective geometry and are consequently of a completely different    nature from the usual proofs of theorems in the area of robust statistics.    The authors also consider the computational aspects of the problems.}}Representing all minimum spanning trees with applications to counting and generation@techreport{Epp-TR-95-50,  title = {{Representing all minimum spanning trees with applications to    counting and generation}},  author = {David Eppstein},  address = {Irvine, CA, 92697-3425, USA},  institution = {Univ. of California, Irvine, Dept. of Information and Computer    Science},  number = {95-50},  year = {1995},  url = {http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/Epp-TR-95-50.pdf}}Reset sequences for monotonic automata@inproceedings{Epp-ICALP-88,  title = {{Reset sequences for monotonic automata}},  author = {David Eppstein},  booktitle = {Proc. 15th Int.

Although    the definition of planarity crucially relies on the concept of plane    embedding, the present technique is applied independently of the embedding,    which may be altered by the graph changes.        The major results are a fully dynamic planarity test working in $O(n^{1/2})$    amortized time per update or query, where $n$ is the number of vertices,    and various efficient dynamic algorithms to maintain connected components,    minimum spanning forests, and 2-edge-connected components, all valid    for planar graphs. As an overall comment, this is a significant and useful    addition to the algorithmic theory of planar graphs.}}Separator based sparsification II: edge and vertex connectivity@techreport{EppGalIta-TR-96-13,  title = {{Separator based sparsification II: edge and vertex connectivity}},  author = {David Eppstein and Zvi Galil and Giuseppe F.

Gibbons},  number = {98k:68039},  year = {1998},  text = {This paper makes a major contribution to the study of dynamic graph    algorithms that maintain some property of a changing graph more efficiently    than recomputation from scratch after each change. Dynamic algorithms    can be classified as fully dynamic, where both edge insertions and deletions    are allowed, or as partially dynamic where only insertions are allowed.    The improved performances for dynamic algorithms are achieved through    the use of the new technique of sparsification which, when applicable,    can speed up a $T(n,m)$ time bound for a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices    and $m$ edges to $T(n,O(n))$, almost the time needed if $G$ were sparse.    Sparsification involves partitioning the edges of $G$ into a collection    of $O(m/n)$ sparse subgraphs, each with $n$ vertices and $O(n)$ edges.    The information relevant for each subgraph can be summarised in an even    sparser subgraph, called a sparse certificate. Certificates are merged    in pairs, producing larger subgraphs which are made sparse again by computing    their certificates. The result is a balanced binary tree in which each    node is represented by a sparse certificate. Each update involves $\log    (m/n)$ graphs with $O(n)$ edges each, instead of one graph with $m$ edges.    A more careful partition into subgraphs causes each update to involve    a sequence of graphs with $O(n)$ edges in total. Three variants of the    sparsification technique are developed. The first is used in situations    where no previous fully dynamic algorithm was known and gives time bounds    of $O(n)$ per update. The second variant uses a dynamic data structure    to maintain certificates possessing a stability property, thereby transforming    time bounds of the form $O(m\sp p)$ into $O(n\sp p)$. In the third variant,    deletions are performed as in the first variant, and insertions by using    a partially dynamic algorithm. This leads to insertion times often matching    those of known partially dynamic algorithms, together with deletion times    similar to those of the first variant. Results include the maintenance    of minimum spanning forests, graph connectivity, graph 2-edge connectivity    and bipartiteness in time $O(n\sp {1/2})$ per change; 3-edge connectivity    in time $O(n\sp {2/3})$ per change; 4-edge connectivity in time $O(n\alpha(n))$    per change; $k$-edge connectivity for constant $k$ in time $O(n\log n)$    per change; 2-vertex connectivity and 3-vertex connectivity in time $O(n)$    per change; and 4-vertex connectivity in time $O(n\alpha(n))$ per change.    Further results speed up the insertion times to match the bounds of known    partially dynamic algorithms. The paper concludes with sections on recent    related work and remaining open questions.}}Speeding up dynamic programming@techreport{EppGalGia-TR-88,  title = {{Speeding up dynamic programming}},  author = {David Eppstein and Zvi Galil and Raffaele Giancarlo},  address = {New York, NY, 10027, USA},  institution = {Columbia Univ., Computer Science Dept.},  number = {CUCS-327-88},  year = {1988}}@inproceedings{EppGalGia-FOCS-88,  title = {{Speeding up dynamic programming}},  author = {David Eppstein and Zvi Galil and Raffaele Giancarlo},  booktitle = {Proc. 29th Symp.

Given a graph    $G$ and another graph $H$, one must determine whether $G$ has a subgraph    that is isomorphic to $H$. In this fully general form, the problem is    NP-complete; but if $H$ is a fixed $l$-vertex graph, as the author points    out, this problem can clearly be solved in $O(n\sp l)$ time, where $n$    is the number of vertices of $G$. In the current paper, it is assumed    that $G$ and $H$ are planar; and in this case the author develops an    algorithm that requires only $O(C\sb Hn)$ time (although the constant    $C\sb H$ grows exponentially with $l$---necessarily so, if $\rm P\ne    NP$).         The main idea behind the algorithm is that of constructing a cover $\{G\sb    i\}$ for a planar graph $G$ and providing a so-called "tree decomposition"    for each element $G\sb i$ of the cover. (A tree decomposition of a graph    $G$ is a tree $T$ with these properties: (1) each node $N$ of $T$ is    provided with a label $L(N)\subseteq V(G)$; (2) for each $v\in V(G)$,    the set of tree nodes whose labels contain $v$ forms a contiguous subtree    of $T$; and (3) for each edge $\{v,w\}$ of $G$, there is at least one    node $N$ of $T$ such that both $v$ and $w$ are in $L(N)$.) Specifically,    for an $n$-vertex planar graph $G$, the author shows how, for any positive    integer $w$, to do the following in $O(w\sp 2n)$ time. He covers $G$    with a collection of subgraphs $\{G\sb i\}$, so that each vertex of $G$    is included in at most $w$ of the $\{G\sb i\}$; he provides for each    $G\sb i$ a tree decomposition in which all labels have $\le(3w-2)$ elements;    and he partitions $V(G)$ into subsets $\{S\sb i\}$ in such a way that,    for any connected $w$-vertex subgraph $H$ of $G$, if $i$ is the smallest    value for which $H\cap S\sb i$ is nonempty, then $H$ is a subgraph of    $G\sb i$ but is not a subgraph of $G\sb j$ for any $j>i$. The main result,    an algorithm for deciding the isomorphism question in linear time, is    then based on dynamic programming in the trees associated to the subgraphs    $\{G\sb i\}$.         The author also uses this technique to construct efficient algorithms    for a number of other decision and enumeration problems for planar graphs,    including connectivity, diameter, girth, induced subgraph isomorphism,    and shortest path.}}@misc{cs.DS/9911003,  title = {{Subgraph isomorphism in planar graphs and related problems}},  author = {David Eppstein},  eprint = {cs.DS/9911003},  howpublished = {ACM Computing Research Repository},  month = {November},  year = {1999}}Subquadratic nonobtuse triangulation of convex polygons@techreport{Epp-TR-91-61,  title = {{Subquadratic nonobtuse triangulation of convex polygons}},  author = {David Eppstein},  address = {Irvine, CA, 92697-3425, USA},  institution = {Univ. of California, Irvine, Dept. of Information and Computer    Science},  number = {91-61},  year = {1991}}Tangent spheres and triangle centers@misc{math.MG/9909152,  title = {{Tangent spheres and triangle centers}},  author = {David Eppstein},  eprint = {math.MG/9909152},  howpublished = {arXiv.org e-Print archive},  month = {September},  year = {1999}}@article{Epp-AMM-01,  title = {{Tangent spheres and triangle centers}},  author = {David Eppstein},  eprint = {math.MG/9909152},  journal = {American Mathematical Monthly},  publisher = {Amer.

They show    NP-completeness (with a fully polynomial time approximation scheme),    if the number of distinct values in each distribution is a constant greater    than 2, and NP-hardness to approximate the problem within any constant    approximation factor, if that number is an arbitrary integer. Finally    they show that the related max-min problem (maximize the expectation)    is polynomially solvable for a constant number of values in each distribution.         The article is a very interesting example of demonstrating the interplay    of probability theory and computer science. The reader should be familiar    with the concepts of NP-theory, including the issue of approximation    algorithms for such problems.}}The skip quadtree: a simple dynamic data structure for multidimensional data@inproceedings{EppGooSun-SCG-05,  title = {{The skip quadtree: a simple dynamic data structure for multidimensional    data}},  author = {David Eppstein and Michael T.
