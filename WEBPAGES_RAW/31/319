===== About =====

<HTML> Prof. Dutt's research group has various efforts in the area of embedded systems and computer-aided design, with a specific focus on the exploration,   evaluation and design of domain-specific embedded systems spanning both software and hardware.

His group has developed a novel architectural description language that facilitates rapid exploration of programmable embedded systems,   as well as automatic generation of software toolkits supporting embedded systems development (including optimizing compilers and simulators).

Other projects within his group include cross-layer design and optimization of reliable, distributed embedded systems, memory architecture exploration  for embedded systems, and brain-inspired architectures and computing.
