<p><b>Abstract: </b>
For many embedded applications, program code size
is a critical design factor. One promising approach for
reducing code size is to employ a "dual instruction set", 
where processor architectures support a normal (usually
32 bit) Instruction Set, and a narrow, space efficient
(usually 16 bit) Instruction Set with a limited set of 
opcodes and access to a limited set of registers. This feature, 
however, requires compilers that can reduce code
size by compiling for both Instruction Sets. Existing
compiler techniques operate at the function-level granularity 
and are unable to make the trade-off between increased register 
pressure (resulting in more spills) and
decreased code size. We present a profitability based
compiler heuristic that operates at the instruction-level
granularity and is able to effectively take advantage of
both Instruction Sets. We also demonstrate improved
code size reduction for the MIPS 32/16 bit ISA, using
our technique. Our approach more than doubles the
code size reduction achieved by existing compilers.
