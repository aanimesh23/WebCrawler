<b>Abstract</b><BR>
This dissertation presents several new algorithms and heuristics for constraint
satisfaction problems, as well as an extensive and systematic empirical evaluation
of these new techniques. The goal of the research is to develop algorithms which
are effective on large and hard constraint satisfaction problems.
<p>
The dissertation presents several new combination algorithms. The BJ+DVO
algorithm combines backjumping with a dynamic variable ordering heuristic that
utilizes a forward checking style look-ahead. A new heuristic for selecting a value
called Look-ahead Value Ordering (LVO) can be combined with BJ+DVO to yield
BJ+DVO+LVO. A new learning, or constraint recording, technique called 
jumpback learning is described. Jump-back learning is particularly eective because it
takes advantage of eort that has already been expended by BJ+DVO. This type
of learning can be combined with either BJ+DVO or BJ+DVO+LVO. Learning
is shown to be helpful for solving optimization problems that are cast as a series
of constraint problems with successively tighter cost-bound constraints. The 
constraints recorded by learning are used in subsequent attempts to nd a solution
with a lower cost-bound.
