<p align=justify>  
Sensor devices are promising to revolutionize our interaction with 
the physical world by allowing continuous monitoring and reaction to 
natural and artificial processes at an unprecedented level of spatial and 
temporal resolution. As sensors become smaller, cheaper and more 
configurable, systems incorporating large numbers of them become feasible. 
Besides the technological aspects of sensor design, a critical factor 
enabling future sensor-driven applications will be the availability of an 
integrated infrastructure taking care of the onus of data management. 
Ideally, accessing sensor data should be no difficult or burdensome than 
using simple SQL.  In this paper we investigate some of the issues that 
such an infrastructure must address. Unlike conventional distributed 
database systems, a sensor data architecture must handle extremely high 
data generation rates from a large number of small autonomous 
components. And, unlike the emerging paradigm of data streams, it is 
infeasible to think that all this data can be streamed into the query 
processing site, due to severe bandwidth and energy constraints of 
battery-operated wireless sensors. Thus, sensing data architectures must 
become <I> quality-aware</I>, regulating the quality of data at all levels of 
the distributed system, and supporting user applications' quality 
requirements in the most efficient manner possible.
