We can all remember when embedded software development was a major 
problem area for many large integrated systems. Tiger teams, fire 
fighting, and audits were common everyday activities. Within the Boeing 
Space Transportation Systems (STS) organization, we institutionalized 
a smooth running software development team using well-defined processes 
and trained employees. I would like to share thoughts and insights that 
helped bring about this transition. The first is that we approached 
process improvement in response to our business goals. Secondly, we 
acknowledged process improvement is a human issue. Hear how we developed 
a management goal framework as a road map for the business case. Also, 
hear how we implemented a simple four-step formula for success to address 
the human aspects of cultural change. This formula, applied to software 
development, resulted in dramatic improvements and excellent performance 
for STS.

<strong>Biography:</strong>
George Yamamura is the Software Engineering Process Manager 
of Boeing Information, Space & Defense Systems (ISDS) in Seattle, 
Washington. He supports ISDS programs and deployment of best practices. 
Previous to that, he managed the STS software development and its effort 
that led to an SEI CMM Level 5 rating. He has 30 years of software 
experience in the space application field. He has bachelor's and master's 
degrees in Aeronautics & Astronautics from the University of Washington 
and a master's degree in Applied Math from the University of Santa Clara.

The road to successful process improvement requires a clear understanding 
of the challenges ahead for the Software Engineering Process Group (SEPG). 
Many organizations believe the effort will be straightforward and too often 
view it in mechanical terms without addressing the unique problems to be 
encountered. We have identified sixteen areas that can provide unique 
challenges for the SEPG. We have grouped these challenges into three areas, 
with the first group of challenges being those related to people issues. 
Consistent with our philosophy, we view process improvement first, and 
foremost, as a human issue. The second group of challenges is related to 
processes, and the third group of challenges focuses on problems related 
to process assets.

Gary Wigle is the Associate Technical Fellow for software 
processes in Boeing's ISDS in Seattle, Washington. He has more than 
twenty-five years of experience in embedded software applications, both 
in the Air Force and at Boeing. He was the SEPG lead for STS as it 
accomplished a SEI CMM Level 5 rating. He has a bachelor's degree in 
Physics from the U.S. Air Force Academy and a master's degree in Systems 
Management from the Air Force Institute of Technology.
