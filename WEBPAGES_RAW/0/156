G-G interaction using the Wald test

The gg_wald program runs in unix or linux. 

Compile the C++ code: 
	g++ -o gg_wald gg_wald.cpp

Required arguments:
	argument 1: the file name of the case data
	argument 2: the file name of the control data
	argument 3: the name of the output file	

Example of using the gg_wald program: 
	gg_wald cases.txt controls.txt output.txt
Here "output.txt" is the name of the output file. If gg_wald runns successfully, the result in output.txt should be similar to that of "pvalues.txt", the result that I obtained from my computer. 
	

Data formats:
	the case file: an ascii file with S rows and n1 columns, where S is the number of SNPs and n1 is the number of cases
	the control file: an ascii file with S rows and n0 columns, where S is the number of SNPs and n0 is the number of controls
	the output file: row 1 contains the column names; column1: the p-values from the Wald test; column2: the p-values from the Wald1 test
