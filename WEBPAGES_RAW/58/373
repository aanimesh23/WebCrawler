Quantum NP and Beyond
</h1>
<h2>

Abstract:
The theory of NP-completeness has been the basis for our understanding
of important phenomena in the quantum world. The development of the
class QMA (the quantum analog of NP) has shed light on the limits of
quantum computers as well as the complexity of fundamental problems in
condensed matter physics. The connection between these areas arises
from the close relationship between the complexity of constraint
satisfaction problems and the properties of ground states of local
Hamiltonians describing quantum systems. This talk will be a brief
survey of how QMA has helped inform our understanding of quantum
computation and entanglement as well as some of the questions at the
forefront of quantum Hamiltonian complexity.
