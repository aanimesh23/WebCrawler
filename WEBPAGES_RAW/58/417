<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>For this assignment, you will examine some
software system you&#39;re familiar with from a variety of perspectives:
 introducing new users to the system, proposing changes to the system, and
promoting the changed system to its users.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Imagine, for example, that you are in charge
of UCI's Gmail-based electronic mail system.  Periodically you will have to instruct new users on how to use
Gmail  You might write an introductory document, explaining
the basics of electronic mail and the kinds of operations one might expect
to perform (creating a message, sending it, receiving a message, printing
it, saving it, and so on); later in that document, or in another document,
you might give a tutorial providing the details of carrying out those operations
(the specific commands to use), perhaps with a set of examples the reader
would follow.  You might also give an oral introduction to Gmail
to groups of new users or create a video of that introduction. </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>In addition, you might think that Gmail
could be improved in various ways (such as a fancier user interface or
additional features).  Probably you would have to convince someone that these changes would be worth implementing.  For UCI's Gmail, it could be the director of UCI's Office of Information Technology or the director of the Gmail project at Google; for some other system, it might be your
boss or a committee in charge of deciding what software enhancements are
most important. You would
make your case both in a written memo and in an oral presentation.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Any change in an existing system is likely
to disrupt the system&#39;s current users.  If your change were implemented,
you would want to reassure the current users that the new system will be
better for them&mdash;to &quot;sell them,&quot; in other words, on your changes.
 Again you might prepare something written, such as a flyer or brochure
or memo or web page, and also make a short oral presentation or announcement
with the same intent.  </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>For this assignment, you will choose some
software that you&#39;re familiar with and do each of these things.  As
you develop each of these different documents (and their corresponding oral
presentations), focus on how the audience for each document is different&mdash;they
have different experience, different needs, and so on, which means that
how you write for each will be different, too.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Stage I&mdash;choosing a system:</B>  First,
you must decide what system you will use for this assignment.  Your system
may be conventional application software; it may also be a web site with
significantly complex navigation or interaction.  By Thursday, April 4,
send a brief message to theTA, Steve Slota (</FONT><code><A HREF="mailto:sslota@uci.edu">sslota@uci.edu</A></code><FONT  SIZE=4>),
that names the system, describes it if it&#39;s not something everyone&#39;s
familiar with, and sketches out the kind of changes you&#39;re thinking
of proposing.  Based on his feedback, you will give a one- to two-minute
oral presentation of this information to the class on April 11.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Stage II&mdash;introduction for novices:  </B>You
will write an introduction to the system for novice users, of three to four
pages.  This document should give a high-level description of the system
and its capabilities, describing what tasks the system will perform and
giving the necessary background.  It should not get into the tedious minor
details of which keys to press or which menu items to choose; the &quot;Writing
Instructions&quot; project covers that kind of writing, and those details
would extend this assignment far beyond four pages in any case.  A good
draft of this is due on April 17; the final version is due Apri 24.  (All written
assignments are due at the start of class.)  You will also give to the class
a two-minute oral version of this introduction (on April 18 or 23); we plan to videotape
these presentations for review in section.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Stage III&mdash;proposal for change:  </B>You
will write a proposal for changing this system, of five to six pages plus
a brief single-page cover letter.  Address this proposal to whatever decision-making
authority is appropriate for your software:  perhaps the company that publishes
it, perhaps an individual or committee in your own organization.  Try to
find out the actual name of the actual person or group who actually has
the authority to make the changes you suggest, and write your proposal with
that person or group in mind.  Your goal should be to produce a proposal
you can actually send.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>A draft of your proposal is due for joint
editing in class on April 25; a revision based on the joint editing (including
your editor&#39;s comments) is due on May 2.  On May 16, you will give
your final oral proposal for change to the appropriate decision maker; each
presentation should take four minutes.  (We will continue as necessary
on May 22, 23, and 28; we will circulate a sign-up sheet so everyone knows when he
or she will be speaking.)  The final written version of your proposal is
due on May 21.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>This change proposal is the most formal presentation
you will make.  Visual aids are customary in such presentations, and you
will prepare them (in the form of PowerPoint slides or the equivalent) and use them when you
present your proposal.  You will submit a draft of these slides (on paper)
with the draft of your proposal on April 25; you will revise them along with
your revision due on May 2, you will use them in your oral presentation,
and you will turn them in with your final version.  You will find PowerPoint
easy to learn even if you&#39;ve never seen it before, but we would recommend
trying it out more than just a day before the first draft is due. Instead of PowerPoint, you may use Apple's Keynote or open-source equivalents to PowerPoint or even Prezi.com; however, any compatibility issues are your responsibility to resolve before your presentation. </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Stage IV&mdash;promotion for users:  </B>Finally,
you will prepare a one-page flyer, brochure, memo, or web page announcing,
describing, and promoting your change to the current users of the system.
 This &quot;promotion piece&quot; may be one- or two-sided and may be relatively
informal in tone&mdash;just so that it gets the message across without its readers
dismissing it as a joke.  A draft is due for joint editing in class on May 30; the final version is due on June 4.  You will also give a two-minute
oral presentation with the same focus, in class on June 4.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Each part of this assignment shares the same
underlying subject matter.  What&#39;s different in each part is the intended
audience (and thus what knowledge you assume, what you cover explicitly,
and the level of formality).  The table on the next page shows this.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Suggestions and advice:</B>  Choose software
that you know something about, and more importantly, that you care about.
 The best writing (and the easiest for the writer) is writing where the
writer has experience with the topic and really cares about getting it across
to the reader.  So choose something that matters to you.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Always be mindful of your audience.  Novice
users have different needs and a different set of assumptions than decision-makers,
for example.  Moreover, the appropriate level of formality is different
for each of your different audiences.  This table will help you focus on
these distinctions:</FONT>

</P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>We encourage your effective use of graphics,
though graphics may not reduce your prose page count below the minimum.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>To the extent applicable, you should state
your sources of information in your written proposal, backing up whatever
facts and figures you used.  This need <I>not</I> be gathered all together
at the end as a formal bibliography&mdash;it is better to mention the name of
the source at the point where you use its information in the body of the
paper.  If your word processor supports automatic footnotes, use them, but
do not waste time trying to include footnotes manually&mdash;an in-line citation
is fine.  Citations should provide enough detail to allow the reader to
find the cited work and follow up on the information and all the citations
in a document should follow a consistent format, but the precise format
you use is not crucial for this assignment.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>There&#39;s a big difference between spoken
and written language.  For the oral portions of this assignment, do not
simply read from a script.  Of course you will use notes, but speak naturally
rather than reading a &quot;canned&quot; speech.  On the other hand, the
presentations are relatively formal in tone; joking banter and slang are
not appropriate.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>We will be happy to advise you on any aspect
of your proposal.  We&#39;re a valuable resource; take advantage of our
assistance.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Grading of oral presentations:</B>  Oral
presentations are nerve-wracking enough for most people without the addition
of grade pressure.  The main criterion we will use for evaluating your oral
presentations is that you show up to give them, and that you&#39;re well
prepared.  We will not grade down significantly for speaking style or loudness
of voice or oratorical polish, though we do expect that you will try to
address your intended audience appropriately.  We will not grade down at
all for nervousness (though we hope that will abate as the quarter progresses)
or English pronunciation or the speaker&#39;s personality.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>You will have an opportunity to give your
classmates written feedback on their presentations; you will receive some
credit towards class participation for each presentation you comment on.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Stage IV alternative:</B>  Instead of doing
the promotion piece, you may prepare your own r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover
letter according to the guidelines described in class.  The promotion piece
gives you a chance to apply some of the design skills we discussed, but
working on your r&eacute;sum&eacute; is also valuable.  The choice is yours;
the due dates and the course credit are the same with either alternative.</FONT></P>
