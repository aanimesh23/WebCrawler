<H2> Abstract </H2>

The development of user interfaces for large applications is subject to 
a series of well-known problems including cost, maintainability, and 
sensitivity to changes in the operating environment.  The <i>Chiron</i>
(pronounced <i>ky-ron</i>) user interface management sytem (UIMS) has been 
built to address these software engineering concerns.  Chiron has been
designed with the following goals in mind:
<ul>
<LI> Architectural extensibility and flexibility.
<LI> Robustness in the presence of change.
<LI> Facilitation of software reuse.
<LI> Support for concurrency.
<LI> Performance.
</ul>
