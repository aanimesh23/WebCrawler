<b>Abstract</b><BR>
Constraint networks have been shown to be useful in formulating such
diverse problems as scene labeling, natural language parsing, and temporal 
reasoning. Given a constraint network, we often wish to (i) find
a solution that satisfies the constraints and (ii) find the corresponding
minimal network where the constraints are as explicit as possible. Both
tasks are known to be NP-complete in the general case. Task (i) is usually 
solved using a backtracking algorithm, and task (ii) is often solved
only approximately by enforcing various levels of local consistency. In this
paper, we identify a property of binary constraints called row convexity
and show its usefulness in deciding when a form of local consistency called
path consistency is sufficient to guarantee that a network is both minimal
and globally consistent. Globally consistent networks have the property
that a solution can be found without backtracking. We show that one can
test for the row convexity property effciently and we show, by examining
applications of constraint networks discussed in the literature, that our
results are useful in practice. Thus, we identify a class of binary constraint
networks for which we can solve both tasks (i) and (ii) efficiently. Finally,
we generalize the results for binary constraint networks to networks with
non-binary constraints.
