								<br /> Superviser: Prof. Harry Xu,
								Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, 
								University of California, Irvine <br />
								<div class="sub_brief">Brief Description:</div>
								Real-world data-parallel tasks are often developed in managed languages such as Java and C#, 
								which suffer from inefficiencies inherent with their managed runtime. When they manipulate 
								massive amounts of data, their executions are often under great memory pressure. These memory problems 
								are extremely common in Big Data systems. They lead to excessive GC effort and out-of-memory errors, 
								significantly hurting system performance and scalability. We propose a systematic 
								approach that can help data-parallel tasks survive memory pressure, improving their performance and
								scalability without any manual effort to tune system parameters. 
								<br />
								<br />
								This approach advocates interruptable task (ITask), a new type of data-parallel tasks that can be 
								interrupted upon memory pressure with part or all of their used memory reclaimed 
								and resumed when the pressure goes away. We develop a novel programming model and a runtime system, 
								allowing developers to easily implement ITasks for different data-parallel frameworks. We have instantiated 
								ITasks on two state-of-the-art platforms Hadoop and Hyracks. We have reproduced 13 real-world out-of-memory 
								problems reported on Hadoop from StackOverflow on a 11-node cluster. 
								All of these programs are able to run successfully to the end when we use ITask-based implementations.
								A second set of experiments with 5 already well-tuned programs in Hyracks 
								on datasets of different sizes shows that the ITask-based versions are 1.5-3 times faster and scale to 3-24+
								times larger datasets.

								<br /> Superviser: Prof. Harry Xu,
								Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, 
								University of California, Irvine <br />
								<div class="sub_brief">Brief Description:</div>
								The use of managed languages makes programming easier, but their automated memory management comes at a cost. 
								When object-orientation meets Big Data, this cost is significantly magnified and becomes a scalability-prohibiting bottleneck.
								<br />
								<br />
								We propose a novel compiler framework as well as runtime support, called Facade, that can generate highly-efficient data manipulation 
								code by automatically transforming data path of an existing Big Data application. 
								The key to efficiency is that in the generated code, 
								the number of runtime heap objects created for data types in each thread is statically bounded, leading to significantly reduced
								memory management cost and improved scalability.  We have implemented Facade and used it to transform 7 common applications on
								3 real-world (already well-optimized) Big Data frameworks:
								GraphChi, Hyracks, and GPS. Our experimental results are very positive: the generated programs have (1) achieved a 5%--50%
								execution time reduction and a 5--13x GC reduction; (2) consumed up to 50% less memory, and (3) scaled to much larger datasets.

								<br /> Superviser: Prof. Harry Xu,
								Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, 
								University of California, Irvine <br />
								<div class="sub_brief">Brief Description:</div>
								Performance problems in a large-scale application are extremely
								difficult to find. Traditional performance test oracles such as
								time/memory checks are coarse-grained and subjective; as a result,
								performance bugs often escape to production runs, hurting
								software reliability and user experience. 
								<br />
								<br />
								In this project, we focus on  
								a class of performance problems whose symptoms can be described by logical
								statements over a history of heap updates. We propose
								a general technique that can amplify the effects of this kind of performance bugs
								as well as provide precise
								diagnostic information. Amplification serves as an automated
								test oracle because it increases memory consumption significantly
								for tests that trigger performance problems while having a very
								small impact on bug-free runs. As a result, developers can easily
								divide tests into successful and failing runs, and focus their effort
								on failing tests. Using the diagnostic precise information (such as reference paths)
								which is provided by our tool, developers can easily identify the root causes
								of performance problems.

								<div class="sub_brief">Brief Description:</div>
								With more and more Web services available on the Internet, many
								approaches have been proposed to help users discover and select
								desired services. However, existing approaches heavily rely on
								the information in UDDI repositories or WSDL files, which is
								quite limited in fact. The limitation of information weakens the
								effectiveness of existing approaches. A novel Web services
								search engine named CoWS (Comprehensive Web services Search
								engine) is presented. CoWS enriches Web services information
								using the information captured from the Internet to provide
								quality-aware Web services search. The information captured can
								be classified into two groups: functional descriptions and
								subjective feedbacks. The functional descriptions are used to
								enrich descriptions of Web services, and the subjective
								feedbacks are used to calculate Web services��� reputation.
