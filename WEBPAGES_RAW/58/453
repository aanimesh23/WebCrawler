<P><B>Course goals:</B> The first 40 years of
  computer science were concerned mainly with computers themselves&mdash;making
  them faster, smaller, more reliable, and better understood mathematically.
  Perhaps that&#39;s still the main concern of the field as a whole, but
  today computer scientists devote increasing attention to computers in their
  real-world context, which usually involves the people who use them.</P>
<P>
Computers may be complex systems, but human
beings are even more complex, and when we try to understand how computers
and people work together&mdash;well, there&#39;s a lot to cover.  This course
will introduce the broad field of human-computer interaction (HCI):  the
psychological underpinnings of cognition and perception; the variety of
interaction devices, media, and styles; methods for designing systems
and evaluating their usability; and the principles and guidelines the field has developed.  The success of most systems today, especially
consumer products, depends largely on HCI decisions.</P>
<P>
This course is also the prerequisite for Informatics 132, the project course in HCI requirements and evaluation. Also of note are Informatics 133, the course in HCI programming, Informatics 134, the HCI programming project course,  Informatics 143, on information visualization, and Informatics 153, on computer-supported cooperative work.</P>
<P>
<B>Prerequisite courses and concepts:</B>
 The prerequisite for Informatics 131 is one course in computing and upper division
standing. The course will not require any significant programming&mdash;that&#39;s
for Informatics 133&mdash;but we do expect each student to be able to write clear, cogent,
grammatical English at an upper division level because much of the work
in this course will involve describing and justifying the design decisions
and evaluation judgements you make.  We also expect you to have these basic
computing skills:  Searching and browsing the Web, reading and sending Email,
downloading files, viewing and printing PDF (Adobe Acrobat) documents, and
creating or saving documents for Email and other purposes in plain ASCII
text form (not HTML or Word attachments). </P>
<P>
<B>Meeting place and times:</B>  Lecture meets
Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 to 3:50 p.m. in Engineering Tower 202. <!-- The originally listed discussion and lab sections will not meet.--></P>
<P>The projection screen and audio of each class will be recorded and available through UCI Replay; after each class, you will receive electronic mail with the link for access. We must note, however, that this process is not 100% reliable; some classes may end up not being recorded. Moreover, in some classes we will be designing and critiquing our designs; being present to participate in those activities is an important part of the learning and counts towards the participation portion of your course grade.</P>
<P>
<B>Office hours:</B>  
<!-- I will be in or near
my office during these scheduled times, during which course-related matters
will have first priority: 
-->I will plan to be available to discuss course-related matters right after class on Tuesdays and Thursdays.   <!-- Of course emergencies may come
up, but I will try to give advance notice of any change.  If I&#39;m not
immersed in something else, I&#39;ll be glad to answer short questions whenever
I&#39;m in my office, so feel free to drop by any time.m-->    The TA
will have scheduled hours as needed at a time and place to be announced. We&#39;ll also be
happy to make appointments for other times during the week.</P>
<P>
<B>Questions and announcements:</B>  You can
usually get a response to your course-related questions within a few hours
(perhaps a bit longer on the weekends) by sending electronic mail to the
address <code><A HREF="mailto:i131@uci.edu">i131@uci.edu</A></code>. We will never intentionally ignore a message, so if you don't receive a response, write again; sometimes overactive spam fiters snag a legitimate message. Using course-specific subject lines and your UCInet Email address will help your messages get noticed.</P>
<p>Email you send to <code><A HREF="mailto:i131@uci.edu">i131@uci.edu</A></code> is private between you, the TA, the reader, and me. We have also set up a more public discussion forum at <code>www.piazza.com</code>. Piazza has some advantages over the typical noteboard or discussion group; we'll use it this term and analyze its usability, too.</P>
<P>
We may also send course announcements by Email
to the official course mailing list, so you should check your Email regularly.
 Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar
has for you (your UCInet ID).  If you prefer to read your Email on another
account, you should set your UCInet account to forward your Email to your
preferred account (you can do this on the web at <code><A HREF="http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html">http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html</A></code>).
 Don&#39;t let this slide; if you miss official announcements, your grade
could suffer.</P>

This course has a home page at <code><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/131/">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/131/</A></code>; an archive of official course Email is available on your MyEEE page.

  <B>Textbook and course materials:</B>  
  <BR>
<I>Interaction Design:  Beyond Human-Computer Interaction,</I> fourth edition, by Jennifer
Preece, Yvonne Rogers, and Helen Sharp. The third edition is okay, too. The <a href="http://www.id-book.com/buybook.php">publisher's site</a> contains purchasing options, including a <a href="http://www.coursesmart.com/9781119020752">rental e-book</a> at a reduced price.</P>
<P>
<I>The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint: Pitching Out Corrupts Within, </I>second edition, by 
Edward R. Tufte. This short monograph takes a critical look at the use of
PowerPoint, a pervasive means of presenting information. <em>(This document and the following one are available on Amazon for $7 each; we'll be using them in the second half of the course.)</em></P>
<P>
<I>Visual &amp; Statistical Thinking: Displays
of Evidence for Decision Making, </I>by Edward R. Tufte.  This reprint of
Chapter 2 of Tufte&#39;s book, <I>Visual Explanations,</I> describes two
situations where the way information was presented had life-or-death consequences.</P>
<P>
<I><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/10/071210fa_fact_gawande">Annals of Medicine: The Checklist</a>, </I>by Atul Gawande (<em>The New Yorker</em>, December 10, 2007). A broad, practical discussion of how people can better cope with complex systems (in this case, surgery).</P>
<P>
<B>Course structure:
<BR>
</B><I><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/131/hw/index.html">Assignments</A></I>
(40% of the course grade, with later assignments generally weighted more
heavily than earlier ones)
<BR>
<I>Class participation</I> (15%).  This mostly involves being present in class so you can take part in the in-class design and evaluation activities.
Plan to attend every class meeting. <BR>
<I>One midterm,</I> given in class on Thursday, August 20 (15%)
<BR>
<I>One final exam,</I> on Tuesday, September 8, from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. (30%)</P>
<P>We determine final grades neither on a formal curve (with equal numbers of As and Fs, Bs and Ds, and so on) nor on a straight, fixed scale.
  <!-- Scores on the scale shown below will get the grades indicated, but in the past the actual cutoffs have often been lower; this means that you should not assume your grade will be as low as the scale indicates. If you're concerned, check with your TA or the instructor. The basic scale is: grades in the A range (A-, A, and in exceptional cases, A+), 90% and above; grades in the B range, 80%–90%; grades in the C range, 70%–80%. -->
Grades below C are rare in this course; they result mostly from not completing assignments or otherwise not being engaged with the course. We recommend that you focus not on letter grades but on learning what's necessary to earn high scores; the grades will follow from that.</P>
<P>
We&#39;re required to say that in unusual
circumstances, these criteria could change, but we do not expect that to
happen.</P>
<P><B>Special needs:</B> Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation due to a disability should contact the UCI Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to explore the possible range of accommodations. We encourage all students having difficulty, whether or not due to a disability, to consult privately with the instructor at any time. </P>
<P><B>What you must do right now to get started
  in Informatics 131:
  <BR>
  </B>&mdash; If you do not have a UCInet ID,
  get one.  See <code><A HREF="http://activate.uci.edu/">http://activate.uci.edu/</A></code>.
  <BR>
  &mdash; If you prefer to read your electronic mail on an account other than your
  UCInet account, redirect your mail at <code><A HREF="http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html">http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html</A></code>.<BR>
  &mdash; Complete the <a href="http://eee.uci.edu/survey/infx131summer2015">Informatics 131 Questionnaire</a> at http://eee.uci.edu/survey/infx131summer2015 (by 5:00 on Friday, August 7).<br>
  &mdash; Go to <a href="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/">checkmate.ics.uci.edu</a>, log in with your UCInet ID, choose &quot;Course Listing&quot; and &quot;Summer II 2015,&quot; click &quot;Go&quot; next to Informatics 131, and then click &quot;List me for this course.&quot; You'll submit most of your work electronically; this step is necessary to set that up.
  <br>
  &mdash; Sign yourself up for <a href="https://piazza.com/uci/summer2015/informatics131">Informatics 131 on Piazza.com</a>.</P>
<P>
<B>Good advice and helpful hints:</B></P>
<P>
Check your electronic mail regularly; this
is an official channel for course announcements. When sending course-related mail, start the subject line with &quot;Infx 131&quot; or &quot;HCI class&quot;.</P>
<P>
Attendance in class is essential; concepts
and issues that come up in class will find their way onto the exams and
class participation in various forms counts towards the  course grade. Note that missing a day of class in the summer session is like missing a whole week in the regular year. We will only take attendance occasionally; if you're not present one of those times, it counts for a lot.</P>
<P>
Always keep your own copy of each assignment,
both electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the
shuffle (or if a file server should crash, which has happened
in the past), we&#39;ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily.</P>
<P>
If you find yourself having trouble or getting
behind, speak with the instructor.  But <I>never</I> take the shortcut
of copying someone else&#39;s work and turning it in; the consequences can
be far worse than just a low score on one assignment.  The ICS department
takes academic honesty very seriously; for a more complete discussion, see
the ICS academic honesty policy:
