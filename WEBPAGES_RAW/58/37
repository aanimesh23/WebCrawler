Linux Eclipse/C++ Installation

This is the accumulated wisdom I have about installing on Linux.

Instruction follows the same as Windows, but there are slight variations along
the way.

1) when adding other flags for compilation of courselib Library, make sure
   Position Independent Code(-fPIC) is enabled.

2) When linking courselib Library to new projects, everything is the same
   except for an extra step. make sure you go to Run/Debug Settings.
     Select desired project and go to Environment tab
     Click new and add LD_LIBRARY_PATH for variable name and
        ${workspace_loc:courselib/Debug} for value
   That should be good as long as courselib matters.

3) For gtest library, you first need to download the latest version and compile
     the source files yourself. I used cmake from the terminal while being at
     the gtest root directory.
    Then use the make command and grabbed the resulting *.a files and moved it
      to /usr/loc/include directory since it is the default for debian based
      distros.
    Also take whatever is inside the include folder from gtest root and move
      it to /usr/loc/include as well.
    Finally, go to eclipse and add /usr/loc/include for the Compiler setting
      include path.
    This time, you are using File System button, not the workspace one.

    Same for the Linker setting.
    For library names, add gtest and gtest_main which are the two .a files we
      moved around. 
    Also include the path  /usr/loc/include

4) Finally we need to tell the GNU Compiler to use the POSIX library, since
     gtest requires it.
   Just go to Miscellaneous and add -pthread to Linker Flags.
   That should do the trick!
