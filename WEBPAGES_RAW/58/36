<H1>ICS 1F, Homework 4</H1>
<B>Due Wednesday, February 25, at the end of class</B>
</CENTER>

<P>The circles in the following diagram represent the states of a Turing 
machine.  An arrow labeled "a/b,D" means that if the machine sees the 
character "a", it replaces it by "b", moves in direction D (either left 
or right), and changes state as indicated by the arrow.  An arrow labeled 
by "a/accept" or "a/reject" means the machine halts and accepts or rejects 
the string as indicated.  The unlabeled arrow indicates the start state.
A dash indicates the blank character.

<OL>
<P><LI>Indicate for each of the following strings whether the machine above 
accepts, rejects, or goes into an infinite loop without halting: 01, 10, 
011, 001, 0011.

<P><LI>Find a Turing machine that accepts strings of 0's and 1's only when the 
number of 1's is a power of two.

<P><I>(Hint: repeatedly pass left-to-right 
across the string to test whether there is exactly one "1" left, and 
right-to-left across the string changing every other "1" into a "0").</I>

<P><LI>Why is it impossible to prove Church's thesis mathematically?
