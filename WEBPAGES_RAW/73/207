The following instructions describe how to practice using <b>Checkin</b>
  on a special "test class".
When you actually use <b>Checkin</b> you will select the class for which you
  are checking in (you might be using <b>Checkin</b> in multiple classes),
  along with the announced word of the day.

<ol>
<li>
Access the <a href="https://checkin.ics.uci.edu/index.php?tid=54" target="_new">Checkin<a>
  web page.
You should see the following page that identifies the <b>Checkin</b> system,
  which asks you to <b>Please Login to the system</b>.

<p>
Enter your standard <b>UCInetID</b> and <b>Password</b>.
<p>

<li>
Click <b>Login</b>.
<p>
As illustrated on the screen below, select your <b>Course</b>
  (if it is not already selected by the <b>Checkin</b> link you used
   to reach this page: in such cases the <b>Course</b> will be supplied
   and not changeable) and the <b>Word of the Day</b>.
For testing purposes, use the course
  <b>UCI-General: Test Checking :: Test your checkin</b>
  and the word of the day whatever day of the week you
  are testing on (I was testing on a <b>Thrusday</b>).

Click <b>I am in class</b>.
<p>
If you choose an actual course (not the test one), it is likely to show (before
  the quarter starts) as an error:

If the word is correct, and you have checked in successfully, you should see
  the following screen, affirming that you successfully checked in.
