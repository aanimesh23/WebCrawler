<H3>Background</H3>

<p>The Chimera Server is the user's window into the Chimera world. The Chimera Server provides operations to connect to a Chimera 2.0 website and allow hypermedia-enabled clients to access Chimera's hypermedia services.</p>

<p>There is an analogy between the Chimera Server's relationship with Chimera websites and a Web browser's relationship with WWW sites. Just as a user would use a URL to specify interest in a particular WWW site, a user can select among Chimera 2.0 websites and the hyperwebs stored there. To continue the analogy, once the Web browser has downloaded the requested URL, the user has access to hypermedia services such as the ability to follow HTML links. In the same manner, once the user has selected a Chimera hyperweb, all Chimera-aware clients can provide the user with hypermedia services such as the ability to follow Chimera links.</p>

<p>The Chimera Server also provides Chimera with a proxy in the user's environment which allows it to communicate with the user when it needs more information or to report an error. In addition, the user is able to configure the behavior of Chimera and to create and manipulate Chimera links.</p>

<H3>Connecting to a Chimera Website</H3>

<p>An example of accessing a Chimera website using the Chimera Server <a href="selection_example.html">is available</a>.</p>
