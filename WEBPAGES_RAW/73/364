<H1> Overview and Prerequisite Knowledge </H1>
<P>
From the UCI Catalog:
<blockquote>
Study of the concepts, methods, and tools for the analysis, design,
construction, and measurement of complex software-intensive systems.
Underlying principles emphasized.  State-of-the-art software engineering
and promising research areas covered, including principles of software
engineering, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing,
and project management.
</blockquote>

<P>
This class is a graduate survey of software engineering topics.  The
instructors assume background in software engineering, as well as some
experience in developing software systems.  For example, the course
assumes knowledge of the basic ideas of:  software development phases
(e.g., requirements engineering, design, implementation), software
development processes (such as the spiral model and the waterfall
model), software design methodologies (such as design based on
information hiding), software testing and analysis strategies, and
project management issues (e.g. chief programmer teams).
Students new to this area are advised to take ICS 121, as this course
will not repeat basic material, but rather will be focused on issues at
the frontier of software engineering.  At the end of the class students
should be knowledgeable about what key problems are currently being
pursued by software researchers, what the key approaches are, and who are
many of the leading researchers.

<P>
The vehicles for learning about the topics are readings from the textbook,
readings from the technical literature, lectures, and classroom discussion.
The class is co-taught by the software faculty in order for specialty topics
to be presented in depth.

<H1> Assignments and Assessment </H1>

<P>
<ul>
<li>  Paper/topic summaries.  For each paper assigned during the class
(expectation:  about 10-12) you are required to submit a two-page (appx.
800 word) summary and evaluation.  One page should summarize the key points
or contributions of the paper.  The second page should assess the applicability
of the ideas, problems in applying the ideas, or provide other critical
evaluation.  In aggregate these summaries will account for 40% of your
grade.
<li>  Term paper.  Accounting for 30% of your grade, the term paper is
an in-depth exploration of some current topic in software engineering.
(The paper must be new for this class, not a warmed-over paper written for
some other ICS class.)  This paper may be largely survey in character.
Substantial latitude will be allowed in choosing the topic, but all topics
must be approved in advance by the instructor.
<li>  Class attendance and participation is critical.  This will account
for 10% of your grade.
<li>  Final exam.  A final exam, worth 20%, will allow you to demonstrate
your understanding of the papers and topics covered in class.
