<FONT ><I>Literature is not an abstract science, to which
exact definition can be applied.
<BR>
It is an art, the success of which depends on personal persuasiveness,
<BR>
on the author&#39;s skill to give as on ours to receive.</I></FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Often we write to persuade someone to adopt
our point of view or take some action.  Perhaps more than any other writing,
persuasive writing requires appreciation of the reader&#39;s interests and
goals.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4><B>This assignment:</B>  For this assignment,
you will write a letter to one of the policy makers listed below.  In approximately
three pages, you should take a position, recommend some action, and back
it up with the best reasoning you can; don&#39;t just raise the issue or
state a concern.  Plan actually to <I>send</I> this letter; don&#39;t treat
it as simply a classroom exercise.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Choose a public policy issue involving technology,
an issue you care about strongly, and one about which you have some information
or knowledge.  It&#39;s much easier to write with conviction if you really
have that conviction; it requires real talent to fake it. On the other hand,
you must approach your topic with enough objectivity to understand the opposing
point of view and deal with those arguments in a reasoned way.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Your topic should be one that you as a computer
scientist have some particular reason to address.  Some current policy issues
that relate to computing are objectionable material on the Web, Email &quot;spam,&quot;
and various privacy issues.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>You should choose a specific recipient, a
policy maker who is an appropriate audience for your opinion, such as President
Obama, Senator Boxer or Feinstein, or the editors of the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>
or the <I>New York Times</I>.  If you have a specialized issue, we can suggest
other appropriate policy makers. </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>As a first step, write a five- to ten-line
outline of your argument, listing the supporting points and the conclusion
like a syllogism; turn this in with each revision of your letter. You may
find useful the entries in one of the writing guides on argument, logic,
and thesis; you might also think back on what you know about symbolic logic.
 </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Your conclusion should recommend some action
on someone&#39;s part; don&#39;t simply raise the issue and complain about
the status quo.  Moreover, be sure that the recipient of your letter is
someone who has the power to take the action you recommend. Broadly, here
are some guidelines: If you want a new law introduced (or if you want to
support or oppose currently proposed legislation), write a legislator (Senators
Feinstein or Boxer, your local member of Congress, or the chair of the relevant
House or Senate committee).  If you want some action by the Executive Branch
(e.g., for the Justice Department to renew an antitrust case against Microsoft),
write to the person in charge of that branch (the Attorney General in the
case of the Justice Department).  The most effective thing the President
can do is move public opinion; you should write to the President if you
want him to take a public stand on some issue (or if you want him to sign
or veto a particular piece of legislation that has passed out of Congress);
the President doesn't officially originate or introduce legislation, and
he won&#39;t even have his staff propose legislation for a legislator to
introduce except on the biggest public policy issues (like health care or
tax reform).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>If you took Writing 39C at UCI and wrote a
research paper on a technical policy issue, you may write about the same
issue here.  Note, however, that a letter to a policy maker is different
from a research paper:  This letter is shorter, it won&#39;t cite research
sources as completely and meticulously, and it will recommend to the recipient
a particular course of action and address explicitly the reasons why the
recipient should take that action.  In particular, you need to say what
you want, right up front, and then give the reasons.  It&#39;s an unfortunate
and brutal fact that high-profile officials receive hundreds or thousands
of letters a day; they have staff who screen them, perhaps just reading
the first paragraph and tallying the letter as &quot;pro&quot; or &quot;con&quot;
on an particular issue.  It&#39;s the rare letter that&#39;s so well written
that the staff person will read the whole thing, and even rarer still that
they&#39;ll pass it along to the official him- or herself.  Of course it&#39;s
that kind of gemlike letter that we&#39;re aiming for, but for it to pass
the first threshold, it has to state up front what it wants the official
to do.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Finally, make sure you address your letter
properly; you don&#39;t say &quot;Dear Mr. Obama&quot; when addressing the
President.  (Search for &quot;forms of address&quot; in Google if you need
to.)</FONT></P>

<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Due dates:</B>  </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>&bull; April 16&mdash;Your outline, together with a good
draft of your letter.  We will edit these jointly in class.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>&bull; April 23&mdash;A draft of your outline and letter,
revised based on the joint editing.  Also include your editor&#39;s comments.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>&bull; May 7&mdash;The final version of your letter,
along with the outline and all previous versions.</FONT></P>
