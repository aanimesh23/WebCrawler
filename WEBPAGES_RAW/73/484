<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>This assignment is due at the beginning of
your discussion section on Wednesday, November 12.  Unlike previous assignments,
this one requires some open-ended experimentation in the labs, so don&#39;t
expect to be able to complete it in one sitting.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Summary:</B> In this assignment you will
gain familiarity different tools for creating, editing, and storing images
and with applying compression techniques and understanding their effects.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(a)</B> The lab machines provide these
three tools for image manipulation:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>&#160;&#160; * The drawing layer in Microsoft
Word
<BR>
&#160;&#160; * Paint (in the Accessories menu)
<BR>
&#160;&#160; * Microsoft Photo Editor (in the Office Suite) or Iview image
editor (the labs will have one or the other)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Spend some time familiarizing yourself with
each of these tools, getting answers to the questions below.  Remember that
the main point is <I>finding</I> the answer, not the answer itself.  You
won&#39;t get much from the assignment if you let someone else do the work.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Most people who become experts at using a
particular application program get their expertise through experience, not
(primarily) by reading the documentation.  Moreover, that experience comes
not only from working on specific tasks but also from experimentation, or
&quot;playing around&quot;--trying different commands or actions to see
what results.  You should take this opportunity to do the same.</FONT></P>
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Which tool(s) do vector (line) graphics? 
Which edit bitmaps?</FONT></LI>
<BR><BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>What graphics file formats (GIF, JPEG, BMP,
etc.) do these tools read?  (Check the &quot;Open&quot; dialog or the &quot;Import&quot;
command.)  Which do they write?  (Check &quot;Save As&quot; or &quot;Export&quot;.)</FONT></LI>
<BR><BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Create one or two images of some complexity
using each tool (or read images, e.g., from the Web, if the tool doesn&#39;t
allow creation of new images).  Spend some time trying out the menus and
buttons to see what they do, and make a note of the most useful or interesting
features (which will probably be different in the different tools).</FONT></LI>
<BR><BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>How big is each of these images when you save
it in the tool&#39;s default format?  How does the size change if you choose
other resolutions, other bit depths, and other file formats?  What&#39;s
the smallest size at which you can save your image without losing noticeable
quality?  What&#39;s the smallest size that may lose quality but still keeps
the image recognizable?  Are these results what you expect, given your knowledge
of image representation, or were there surprising results?</FONT></LI>
<BR><BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>What happens when you copy an image from one
tool and paste it into another?  Are there things you can do to the image
in the second tool that you can&#39;t in the original tool, or vice versa?
 </FONT></LI>
<BR><BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Can the second tool save the image as a significantly
smaller file (and if so, is any noticeable quality lost)?</FONT></LI>
</OL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>The main goal of this lab is to give you enough
experience with these tools to appreciate the ways you might use them. 
Don&#39;t short-change the time you spend exploring and experimenting. 
Your answers to the questions above don&#39;t have to be long, but they
should be complete enough to show you&#39;ve spent some time.  Printed illustrations
will be helpful.  You&#39;ll submit this on paper, clearly marked &quot;part
<B>(a)</B>.&quot;</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b)  </B>Below is a cryptogram from the
<I>Saturday Review.</I>  Your job is to decode it back into the original
English message.  Feel free to work on this in groups of two or three. 
However, if you have past experience solving cryptograms, please work by
yourself; otherwise, the experienced person will overwhelm everyone else
in the group.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>A cryptogram is a message or quotation written
in a substitution cipher--for each letter in the original message, a different
letter has been uniformly substituted in the cryptogram.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Here&#39;s a hint for working in groups: 
Everyone should work on the same copy of this sheet at once.  That way,
if you want to start over you can use a new, clean worksheet.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=5>BSL  PLXB  NFIB  CR  BSL  RDEBDCV  DV  JFVA
VCYLUX  DX  BSL  VCBDEL BSFB  BSL  ESFIFEBLIX  FIL  NHILUA  DJFKDVFIA. 
     -- RIFVOUDV N. FTFJX</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Now, ask yourself:  What property of natural
language do cryptograms illustrate?  Print your solution to the cryptogram
and the one-word answer to this question, both clearly marked &quot;part
<B>(b)</B>.&quot;</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c)</B>  In class we discussed delta encoding.
 Here you will perform delta encoding on two sequences and calculate their
compression ratios.  You will also plot the two sequences in a line graph
and write a paragraph or two describing your results.  In addition, you
will compress one of the sequences by varying the quantization (i.e., by
using fewer digits of precision), again plotting and commenting on the results.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.1)</B>  First, download the file </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/10a/hw/CompressionMaster.xls">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/10a/hw/CompressionMaster.xls</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>
.  Then open the file in Excel.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Follow the instructions in the file for identifying
the two columns of data you will work with.  (Everyone gets different data,
depending on their student ID; use the correct set or you won&#39;t get
credit.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Create a new spreadsheet with your name and
other identifying information.  Copy into that spreadsheet your own two
columns of data from the CompressionMaster spreadsheet.  Mark those columns
&quot;Original Data A&quot; and &quot;Original Data B.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.2)</B>  Do these three steps for both
A and B:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>-- In an adjacent column, produce a delta-encoded
version of the sequence (i.e., compute just the differences between each
item and its predecessor).  (Selecting the cells in the new column and using
&quot;Fill Down&quot; from the Edit menu will save you from having to type
repetitively similar formulas.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>-- Calculate the compression rate (the number
of ASCII symbols in the compressed data divided by the number of ASCII symbols
in the uncompressed data).  (Cutting and pasting to use &quot;Word Count&quot;
from the &quot;Tools&quot; menu of Microsoft Word is better than counting
by hand.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>-- Plot a chart of the sequence, using a line
graph with no markers.  Be sure to include an appropriate heading.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.3)</B>  Now, do this additional task,
just for the A data:  Create a new column, dividing each value by 1000.
 (The original data was in millimeters; your new column is in meters.) 
This new column will have three digits to the right of the decimal point.
 To vary the quantization, create three <I>more</I> columns:  One with two
digits to the right, one with one digit to the right, and one with no digits
to the right of the decimal point.  The Round function helps here.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>As before, calculate the compression rates
for each of the three reduced-precision columns.  Then produce a bar graph
showing the relative sizes of the four representations.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Next, plot the original data (in meters) against
each of the three reduced-precision versions (i.e., produce three plots).
 Be sure to label the graphs appropriately.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.4)</B>  Finally, write a couple of paragraphs
describing your results.  What you write should provide answers and explanations
to the following questions, at least:  Did both sequences compress equally
well using delta encoding?  Could you have predicted the results from looking
at the graphs?  How much reduction of precision was possible before the
quality of the data degraded significantly (i.e., at what point could you
detect a difference between the original and compressed data)?</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Print these answers, marking them clearly
&quot;part <B>(c)</B>.&quot;</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(d)</B>  The class and the text describe
run-length encoding (RLE).  Find three images of flags on the Web:  one
that will compress very well using RLE, one that will compress very poorly
using RLE, and one in the middle.  Justify your choices in a few brief sentences
(i.e., say why the good one&#39;s good, and so on).  (Hint:  The study of
flags is called vexillology, so using that as a search term will point to
lots of flag images.)  Download the images from the Web and place them in
your report, adjusting them so they&#39;re uniformly sized and neatly aligned.
 (The graphics tools from the first part of this assignment should help.)
 Mark this all &quot;part <B>(d)</B>.&quot;</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(e)</B>  Below are three images.  Image
A is the original; the other two are compressed using lossy techniques.
 One used a reduced quantization; the other used coarser sampling.  Which
is which (with a sentence explaining your answer)?  Print it and mark it
as usual.</FONT></P>
<P>

</P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(f)</B>  Below are three more images. 
Which would compress best using delta encoding?  Which would compress worst?
 Again, justify your answer in a sentence or two, printed out and marked
&quot;part <B>(f)</B>.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P>

<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(g)</B>  Select a pair of DNA strings from
the list below.  (Be sure to select the correct pair according to the instructions,
or you won&#39;t get credit.)  Compress the two strings using run-length
encoding and calculate the compression rates, showing your work fully. 
Then describe in a couple of sentences why the strings didn&#39;t compress
equally well (i.e., what is it about one string that made it more amenable
to compression than the other?).  Print and mark this part, too.</FONT></P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(h)</B> (extra credit)  As we showed in
class, LZW compression finds previously occurring portions of a text and,
rather than spelling them out again fully, includes a (shorter) reference
to the portion&#39;s first occurrence.  Thus, &quot;Mississippi&quot; could
be compressed to &quot;Miss[2,3]ippi&quot; (without compressing single-letter
pieces).  Another way to represent this same kind of compression is with
a dictionary:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>&#160;&#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">#
iss</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>  (This single-entry dictionary
says to substitute &quot;</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">iss</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>&quot;
for the shorter &quot;</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">#</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>&quot;)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>&#160;&#160; </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">M##ippi</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Even the above short example saves one character
if we ignore white space.  If we do the same with &quot;Hodgepodge,&quot;
we save even more since the dictionary would contain the one entry &quot;</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">#
odge </FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>&quot;  and the word itself contains
just the characters &quot;</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New">H#p#</FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>&quot;;
this would be a compression rate of 0.9, since the dictionary plus the word
take up 9 characters (ignoring white space) while the original word took
up 10.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Here, then is the task:  Find an English word
with a better compression ratio (using this method) than 0.9.  You&#39;re
allowed to have multiple entries in the dictionary; that might help in some
cases.  We&#39;ll share the best ones in class.  (For a slightly easier
task, find a short English <I>sentence</I> that has a better compression
ratio than 0.9.)</FONT></P>
