<H4>I.   ESTABLISHMENT</H4>

The Southern California Software Process Improvement Network, hereafter 
referred to as the Southern California SPIN, was originally established on 24
January 1992 as an activity sponsored by the University of California's Irvine
Research Unit in Software (IRUS).

<h4>II.  MISSION </h4>

     The Southern California SPIN is a leadership forum for the free and 
open exchange of software process improvement experiences and practical
ideas.  We promote achieving higher levels of process maturity, software 
quality and mutual respect.  Our goal is to enhance skills and support 
technology transition through an active program of networking, publications,
recognition of excellence, and mutual support.

<h4>III. OBJECTIVES</h4>

In carrying out its mission, the Southern California SPIN organization 
acts to accomplish the following objectives within the software community:

<ul> 
<li>Advance the quality of software;

<li>Improve software productivity;

<li>Promote software process maturity;

<li>Transfer software improvement knowledge and innovation to
    all participants;

<li> Share lessons learned between participants and other SPIN organizations;

<li> Promote cooperation between industry, academia, and government with 
     respect to software process improvement technology.
</ul>

<h4>IV.  ORGANIZATION</h4>

The Southern California SPIN is organized as a Steering
Committee, various working groups, general participants, and individual 
meeting coordinators.  Steering Committee members, working group
members, general participants and meeting coordinators receive no 
remuneration for their services.

The Southern California SPIN is sponsored by the Irvine Research Unit in 
Software (IRUS), an organization chartered by the University of California, 
Irvine. SPIN roles and responsibilities are shared by members of the SPIN 
Steering Committee and IRUS staff.

<h4>A.   STEERING COMMITTEE</h4>

The Steering Committee consists of those SPIN participants who have 
committed to actively take on the roles and responsibilities of the various 
functions necessary to run the Southern California SPIN. The Steering 
Committee operates as a consensus based decision making team with the following
specific roles:  leader, deputy leader, IRUS representative, recorder, 
liaison, working group chairs and members-at-large.  One or more individuals 
may fulfill a specific role. This is not a hierarchically organized team; all 
roles have equal voice in the decision making process.

The Steering Committee meets after the general SPIN meeting.  The
meetings are open to all interested SPIN participants.  Generally these 
meetings occur over lunch.  

The responsibilities of the Steering Committee are as follows:

<ul>
<li>Manage the affairs of the Southern California SPIN;</ut>

<li>In coordination with IRUS, generate the operating budget. This budget 
should cover all SPIN- related costs except personnel time;

<li>The budget must be approved by the IRUS Executive Committee to ensure 
     compliance with University of California Research Unit regulations.

<li>The SPIN budget funds may not be appropriated if the IRUS budget 
experiences a shortfall.

<li>Maintain coordination with other SPIN organizations;

<li>Identify program coordinators for the SPIN meetings;

<li>Approve topics and speakers for SPIN meetings;

<li>Approve the establishment, charter, and disbandment of working groups, 
    and selection of working group chairs;

<li>Elect Steering Committee members to the roles described in 
    this charter;

    improvements in its operation. This includes reviewing the charter 
    at least annually and reviewing the budget at least bi-annually.</ul>
