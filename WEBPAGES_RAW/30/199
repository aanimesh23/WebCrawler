<H1>Restricted Databases</H1>

Ivan Bratko requested that the databases he donated from the Ljubljana
Oncology Institute (e.g., breast-cancer, lymphography, and
primary-tumor) have restricted access.  We are allowed to share them
with academic institutions upon request. These databases (like several
others) require proper citations be made in published articles that
use them.  Citation requirements are in each database's corresponding
documentation file.<P>

To access any of these databases, please send a request to
<B>ml-repository@ics.uci.edu.</B> Include in the request the names of
the requested databases and the name of your educational
institution.<P>

To help you decide if you want to use any of these databases,
access to the documentation files is provided below.
