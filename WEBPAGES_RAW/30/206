<a NAME="motivation"><h2>Motivation</h2></a>
<blockquote class="justify">
Many emerging applications such as multimedia digital libraries, medical
image databases require accessing multimedia information based on their
content. Traditional text based information retrieval techniques do not
suffice due to the complexity of capturing visual content using textual
description and the high degree of human effort in developing the suitable
descriptions. An alternative approach is to describe images/videos based
on visual properties (such as color, texture, and shape) and support retrieval
based on these features. Such an approach to visual information retrieval
requires interdisciplinary research in the areas of image processing and
computer vision (to extract salient features from the visual media that
capture its content), information retrieval (to define a notion of similarity
between multimedia objects), and database management (to support efficient
storage of multimedia objects and retrieval based on the degree of match).
Our research addresses the information retrieval and database management
challenges in content-based multimedia retrieval.

<h2><a NAME="overview">Overview</h2></a>
<blockquote class="justify">
The goals of the MARS project is to design and develop an integrated multimedia
information retrieval and database management infrastructure, entitled
<i>Multimedia Analysis and Retrieval System</i> (MARS), that supports multimedia
information as first-class objects suited for storage and retrieval based
on their content. Specifically, research in the MARS project is categorized
into the following four sub-areas each of which contribute to the development
of the integrated infrastructure.
<p>
 <li><b><i>Multimedia Content Representation:</i></b>
 <blockquote>
 extraction of multimedia content including low-level visual features from images, 
 shots and scenes from videos, textual annotations (user-provided or automatically extracted
 from videos). Content-based representation of multimedia objects in databases.
 </blockquote></li>
 
 <li><b><i>Multimedia Information Retrieval:</i></b>
 <blockquote>development of content-based multimedia retrieval techniques including 
 multimedia retrieval models and interactive query refinement techniques to map 
 user's high-level semantic queries to low-level feature based representations.
 </blockquote></li>
 
 <li><b><i>Multimedia Feature Indexing:</i></b>
 <blockquote>
 to efficiently support retrieval based on feature similarity. Techniques will be 
 developed for overcoming the high dimensionality and non-Euclidean nature of 
 feature data.
 </blockquote></li>

 <li><b><i>Multimedia Database Management:</i></b>
 <blockquote>
 techniques to effectively and efficiently incorporate content-based retrieval 
 of multimedia information into structured database processing. Exploration of 
 extensions to existing data models to support ranked retrieval and interactive query 
 refinement and approaches to integrate multimedia feature indexing techniques as access
 methods in database management systems. Study impact of ranked retrieval
 on query processing techniques.
 </blockquote></li>


Our work has focused on exploring techniques for multimedia object and
query representation, multimedia information retrieval, and developing
mechanisms for efficient indexing of highly multidimensional feature spaces.
Our progress can be categorized into the following:
<p>
 <li><b><i>Video Representation</i></b>: 
 <blockquote>
 Motivated with the role of a table of content (ToC) used in accessing a book, 
 we developed algorithms to structure a video into a set of scenes which represents 
 a video ToC. This ToC can be used to support effective user access (browsing and 
 retrieval) of video. We then explored a clustering based approach to extract key 
 frames from scenes identified in the video ToC. Some <a href="#bibliography">references</a>
 (below) are: 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13.
 </blockquote></li>

 <li><b><i>Indexing Highly Multidimensional Spaces:</i></b>
 <blockquote>
 We developed a hybrid tree data structure to support high-dimension feature indexing 
 in multimedia databases. The hybrid tree combines the positive aspects of bounding region
 (BR)-based data structures (e.g., R-tree, SS-tree) and space partitioning
 (SP) based approaches (e.g., KDB-tree, hB-tree) into a single search structure
 to achieve superior performance and scalability to high dimensionalities
 than either of the two approaches. Some <a href="#bibliography">references</a>
 include (below): 1, and 18.
 </blockquote></li>

 <li><b><i>Multimedia Information Retrieval</i></b>:
 <blockquote>
 We made significant progress on multimedia information retrieval specially on adapting 
 relevance feedback as an approach to learning user's information need in image databases.
 With relevance feedback, the user is relieved of the burden to state their
 exact information need based on the feature sets supported in the system.
 Instead, the system learns both the query representation, and the distance/similarity
 measures that a user has in mind for the feature spaces using positive/negative
 feedback over examples from the user. Some <a href="#bibliography">references</a>
 (below) are: 2,5, 6, 1.
 </blockquote></li>

 <li><b><i>Supporting Multidimensional Data Structures as Access Methods</i></b>:
 <blockquote>
 We have developed the first granular locking approach to concurrency control
 in multidimensional data structures. Our solution provides a scalable solution
 to integrating multidimensional data structures into DBMSs as an access
 method. Some <a href="#bibliography">references</a> (below) are: 3, and 23.
