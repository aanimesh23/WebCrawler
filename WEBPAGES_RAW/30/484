Center Points</a><br>
<a href="/~eppstein/">David Eppstein</a>, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

<p>We show that, for any set of <i>n</i> points in <i>d</i>
dimensions, there exists a hyperplane with regression depth at
least ceiling(<i>n</i>/(<i>d</i>+1)), as had been conjectured by
Rousseeuw and Hubert. Dually, for any arrangement of <i>n</i>
hyperplanes in <i>d</i> dimensions there exists a point that cannot
escape to infinity without crossing at least
ceiling(<i>n</i>/(<i>d</i>+1)) hyperplanes. We also apply our
approach to related questions on the existence of partitions of the
data into subsets such that a common plane has nonzero regression
depth in each subset, and to the computational complexity of
regression depth problems.</p>

<p>This is joint work with Nina Amenta, Marshall Bern and Shang-Hua
Teng.</p>
