				Iterators


Iterators are one of the most useful (and used) features in Python. Besides
being used explicitly in for loops (including for loops in comprehensions),
constructors often include a parameter that is iterable, whose values are used
to initialize the state of the objects they are building: e.g., we write
set(alist) to create a set with all the values from alist (obviously removing
duplicates in the process). Also, calls to functions/classes like sorted and
reversed have iterator arguments and produce list results that we iterate over:
 e.g., for i in sorted(aset): ... takes an iterable as an argument and returns
a list that is iterated over.

In the next three lectures we will explore iterators in more detail. The first
focuses on the underlying mechanics of iterators; the second focuses on examples
of iterators written in/for classes; the third introduces a new kind of
function-like object (called a generator: in computer science it is also known
as a coroutine) that returns a value, but when called again remembers where
it "left off executing" to return another value: this feature makes writing all
sorts of iterators as generators (not classes) much easier.

Throughout these lectures we will also discuss iterator efficiency issues (both
time and space): because iterators are used so often, their running times can
dominate a program's running time; they can often use little space because they
produce their values one at a time, rather than storing them all in a data
structure which is iterated over (although with constructors and comprehensions
we can easily create such a data structure from a iterator, if we need to).

In this lecture we will learn about the __iter__ and __next__ methods (which a
class must implement to be iterated over), how a for loop for iteration is
equivalent to a while loop (which needs a try/except block to catch the
StopIteration exception that is raised by "exhausted" iterators), and how
sharing and mutation affects iterators: sometimes they can cause problems, and
we will learn how to mitigate such problems, although often at the cost of
using more space.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a class to be iterable (i.e., used in a for loop) it must implement the
iterator protocol, which means the __iter__ and __next__ methods. A protocol is
just a group of methods that work together to accomplish something useful. We
have already seen the __enter__ and __exit__ methods that work together to
implement the context manager protocol. Included in the iterator protocol is
the StopIteration class, which is an exception raised by __next__ to signal
there are no more values to iterate over (terminating the for loop). The
builtins module defines the StopIteration class.

Before writing some classes that act as iterators, we will explore the semantics
of Python's for loop, by showing how to build it from an equivalent -but more
primitive- while loop. We can think of Python translating the former into the
latter; the while loop is more primitive than the for loop, so we can see more
details of how for loop works by analyzing the while loop. In this process we
will better understand for loops, and also see how to write loops that process
iterators in a more intricate way than the straightforward (but simple and very
useful) way that for loops proccess them.

------------
for loop with else Interlude

Before discussing this translation, we should first understand how the else
keyword is used in for/while loops. Since I'm not sure how familiar you are
with these statements, I'll start at the beginning (but move quickly).

1) The break statement in Python (just the keyword break as a statement) can be
put in any for/while loop; semantically, when executed it terminates the loop.
I often write loops like

  while True:
     statements
     if test:
          break
     statements

In fact, when the if test: break statement appears FIRST in the the loop, as
shown below,

  while True:
     if test:
         break
     statements

we can write an equivalent while loop that incorporates the test directly

  while not (test):	# not is high precedence, so I put test in ()
      statements

Some programmers/educators banish using breaks in loops, but I think that edict
is too extreme. I could give a long lecture on how programmers (and educators
who teach programming ) feel about break statements. Instead I'll just say the
following. 

  a) When I teach indefinite looping (in ICS-31), I teach the while True/break
     form first. It decouples deciding to loop from how the loop terminates.
     When students need to write a loop, they write an infinite loop first, and
     later decide where to test the "termination" condition, and what this
     condition should be; this test can be stated in the "positive" form:
     terminate when the test is True.

  b) If that test is the first statement in the loop (as shown above; sometimes
     we need to re-arrange code to get equivalent code with that test first)
     then I will SOMETIMES convert it into a while loop whose test is a
     "continuation" condition; the test must be stated in the "negative" form:
     terminate when the test is False (equivalent to continue when the test is
     True).

  c) I think it is much easier to think about termination (stop when some
     specific state occurs) than about continuation (continue in lots of other
     states). Think  about terminating when a value reaches 0 versus continuing
     when the value is any positive number.

  d) Students sometimes go crazy and write too many different conditional 
     breaks inside loops: there is no limit. Programmers need to work hard to
     reduce the number of breaks to simplify their code, but sometimes the
     simplest to understand code has one or a few breaks. In fact, we can also
     have conditional breaks in for loops, because they can terminate that kind
     of loop too (since for loops, as we'll see below, are translated into
     while loops): and sample use might be searching over a range of values
     with a for loop, but terminating when a special value is reached.

  e) Often difficulties with breaks get resolved if we take the loop code we
     are writing and put it in a function, replacing muiltiple breaks by
     multiple returns. Of course some programmers/educators don't like to write
     functions with multiple returns either.

Here is a cannonical example of a while loop that is more easily understood
when written as a while True loop with a conditional break. This is a "sentinel"
loop, which sums the values read until a sentinel (-1) is read. It is a "middle
exit" loop, because termination is computed in the middle of the body of the
loop.

sum = 0
while True:
    value = prompt.for_int('Enter test score (-1 to terminate)')
    if value == -1:
        break
    sum += value
print(Sum =',sum)  # we know here the loop exited, so value == -1 is True

To use a while test loop (and no conditional break), we would need to write

sum = 0
value = prompt.for_int('Enter test score (-1 to terminate)')
while value != -1:
    sum += value
    value = prompt.for_int('Enter test score (-1 to terminate)')
print(Sum =',sum)  # we know here the loop exited, so value != -1 is False

What I object to in the code above is the duplicate prompt; in other code there
might be more even statements duplicated.

2) The actual syntax of a for/while loops are

for index(es) in iterable:	    	 while boolean-expression:
    block-body 	 			     block-body
[else:					 [else:
    block-else]				     block-else]

where [else: block-else] is optional (using [].

Semantically, when each loop terminates (it may terminate "normally" or by
executing a break inside the block-body), if the else keyword is present and
the loop terminated normally, then Python executes block-else. So else means:
execute block-else if the loop didn't execute a break to terminate. In the
case of the for loop, it means the iterator stopped; in the case of the while
loop it means the boolean-expression finally evaluated to False.

As a simple example that illustrates the use of else, we could write the
following code (notice the else is indented at the level of the for, not the if)

for i in range(100):
    if special_property(i):
        print(i,'is the first with the special property')
        break
else:
     print('No value had the special property')

I don't find myself writing else in loops much, but that might be because I
am new to a language that allows such a feature. As I continue to use Python,
I'll come to a more concrete conclusion about the usefulness of this language
feature.
------------

OK, now back to the main event: iterators. Python translates for loops like

  for index(es) in iterable:  # indexes for unpacked assignment: e.g, key,value
      block-body
  [else:
      block-else]

into the following code.

  _hidden = iter(iterable)		# ultimately calls iterable.__iter__()
  try:
      while True:
          index(es) = next(_hidden)	# ultimatelyl calls _hidden.__next__()
          block-body
  except StopIteration:
      pass				# A place-holder, when [] is discarded;
      [block-else]			#    the except block cannot be empty

Note that like Python's len function, its iter and next functions translate
into method calls of __iter__ and __next__ on their argument: e.g.,

def iter(i):
    return i.__iter__()

def next(i):
    return i.__next__()

The key to understanding how iter and next are used in iteration is:

  The iter function MUST return an object on which next can be called.

  Each call to the next function returns a value and advances the state
    of the iteration, until there are no more values to return; then next
    raises StopIteration (there is no next value).

Study this equivalence carefully. Note that _hidden is a special name used by
Python to translate the for loop (it is not really "_hidden"; I'm just trying
to indicate it is a hidden name); it is initialized by calling iter(iterable)
but we cannot use this name in our code; it can be used only in the Python
translation of the for loop. Then Python executes a while True loop INSIDE a
try/except statement. Each iteration of the loop binds the next value(s) to be
iterated over to index(es) and then executes block-body. This
rebinding/block-body execution continues until either 

  (1) next raises the StopIteration exception, which is handled by causing the
      loop to terminate (the except is OUTSIDE the loop, so handling the
      exception causes Python to exit the loop, terminating it) and executing
      block-else (and if there is not block-else, just executing pass)

  (2) block-body executes a break statement, which causes the loop to terminate.
      Because there was no exception in the body of the try, the try/except
      terminates without having to handle an exception, and therefore does not
      execute block-else.

Most for loops do not contain break statements, so (1) happens more frequently.

As a concrete example, the simple for loop

for i in range(1,6):       # for the values 1-5
    print(i)
    #break  # uncomment to see what break does
else:
    print('executing else')

is translated into

_hidden = iter(range(1,6))
try:
    while True:
        i = next(_hidden)
        print(i)
        #break  # uncomment to see what break does
except StopIteration:
    pass
    print('executing else')

Try executing both scripts in Eclipse, including uncommenting each break
statement to observe the effect of executing this statement: it terminates the
loop and doesn't print 'executing else'

Now that we understand the use of the iter/next functions, we can write more
interesting loops (while loops) that process iterables. For example, suppose
that we wanted to write a function that returned a list of the absolute values
of the differences between each adjacent pair of values in an iterable: e.g.,
for the 5-list [5, 2, 8, 3, 5] it would return the 4-list [3, 6, 5, 2], where
3 = abs(5-2), 6 = abs(2-8), 5 = abs(8-3), and 2 = abs(3-5): there will always
be one fewer values in the returned list because in a list of N values their
are N-1 adjacent pairs to subtract.

The following simple code works for arguments that can be sliced (like lists)

def abs_dif(alist):
    return [abs(a-b) for a,b in zip(alist,alist[1:])]

But it is not easy to write this function efficiently using a for loop
operating on an arbitrary iterable (since arbitrary iterables don't support
slicing). We could turn the iterable into a list, but that would waste space.

def abs_dif(iterable):
    alist = list(iterable)
    return [abs(a-b) for a,b in zip(alist,alist[1:])]

We can write abs_dif without ever turning the iterable into a list as follows,
using a variant of the standard for loop code (translated to a while loop)
that we explored above.

def abs_dif(iterable):
    answer = []
    i  = iter(iterable)
    v2 = next(i)		       # get first value (loop moves v2 to v1)
    try:
        while True:
            v1, v2 = v2, next(i)       # first time, v1 is 1st value, v2 is 2nd
            answer.append(abs(v1-v2))
    except StopIteration:
        pass
    return answer

print(abs_dif(range(1,10,2)), abs_dif([5, 2, 8, 3, 5]))

Now, I wouldn't call this function simple/beautiful, but it is pretty easy to
write and understand. I don't think this function can be written with a for
loop or comprehension (and not waste space), and I'm unsure if there are any
other Python features that we could use to write it more simply and efficiently.
But maybe I just haven't yet seen the right Python idiom.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Classes implementing the iterator protocol: how range really works in Python

In this section we will first write a very simple Countdown class and then a
more complex prange class (pseudo-range) that acts like the real range class
from Python's builtins module. Then we will generalize it by overloading some
simple operators for it (as the real range class does). I'm not sure how range
is really implemented, but this implementation seems straight-forward.

I would like the following iterator behavior for Countdown objects. The loop

for i in Countdown(10):
    print(str(i)+', ',end='')
print ('blastoff')

Should print: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, blastoff

Here is the class implementing these semantics.

class Countdown:
    def __init__(self,last):
        self.last = last	# self.last never changes
    
    # __iter__ must return an object on which __next__ can be called; it returns
    # self, which is an object of the Countdown class, which defines __next__.
    # Later we will see a problem with returning self: when multiple Countdown
    # objects must be iterated over simultaneously, and solve that problem. 

    def __iter__(self):
        self.n = self.last	# n attribute is added to the namespace here 
        return self             # (not in __init__) and processed in __next__
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.n < 0:
            raise StopIteration
        else:
            answer = self.n	# or, without the temporary, but more confusing
            self.n -= 1		#  self.n -= 1
            return answer       #  return self.n+1

In this class, when __iter__ is called it (re)sets self.n (the value __next__ 
will return first) to self.last (which is set in __init__ and never changes for
a constructed object). The __iter__ method has a requirement that it must
return an object that defines a __next__ method. Here it returns self, which is
an object constructed from Countdown, which defines __next__ (right below
__iter__).

When __next__ is called it checks whether self.n has been decremented past 0,
and if is has, throws StopIteration; otherwise it returns the current value
of self.n, but before doing so it decrements self.n by 1 (by saving it in a
local variable, decrementing it, and then returning the saved local value).

Note that if we substituted Countdown(-1) in the loop above, its body would be
executed 0 times and nothing would be printed before "blastoff".

Also, the following code counts-down twice; in each for loop __iter__ is called,
which initializes self.n to 10 before calling __next__ multiple times.

cd = Countdown(10)
for i in  cd:
    print(str(i)+', ',end='')
print ('blastoff')

for i in  cd:
    print(str(i)+', ',end='')
print ('blastoff')

It print:

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, blastoff
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, blastoff

At the start of each for loop, iter is called to (re)initialize the attribute
n to 10.

------------------------------
Quick interlude: I originally said Python defines iter like len:

def iter(i):
    return i.__iter__()

But the truth is closer to the following (not completely true yet, but correct
until we discuss inheritance). 

def iter(i):
    x = i.__iter__()
    if '__next__' not in x.__dict__ and '__next__' not in type(x).__dict__:
        raise TypeError('iter() returned non-iterator of type '+type_as_str(x))
    return x

If neither the object returned by i.__iter__() nor the class (type) it was
constructed from define a __next__  method, then Python raises an exception
immediately: not waiting for a call of __next__ on the iterator to fail by
raising a NameError exception.
------------------------------

prange: initialization (and the meaning of its arguments)

Now let's aim much higher and write a prange class that operates like the range
class. Recall there are 3 possible parameters for range: start, stop, and step.
Start has a default value of 0 and step has a default value of 1, but we cannot
write the following parameter structure for the __init__ in prange.

    def  __init__(self,start=0,stop,step=1):
        ....

because prange(5) would be an illegal call: it would bind start to 5 but have
no value to bind for stop; but in this case start should be 0 and stop should
be bound to 5. More generallly prange(5) should bind the first/only argument to
stop; prange(1,5) should bind the first argument to start and the second to
stop; and prange(1,5,2) should bind the first argument to start and the second
to stop, and the third to step. How can we write such arguments for such an
__init__ method?

Here is the start of the prange class, using *args in __init__ to solve this
parameter problem. The __init__ methods raises exceptions like range: there must
be 1-3 int arguments and the value of step cannot be 0; the __repr__ method
returns a string just like range: it always shows start and stop values, but
shows the step value only if it is not 1.

To run this code, I need to import the type_as_str function from goody.

class prange:
    def __init__(self,*args):
        for a in args:
            if not type(a) is int:
                raise TypeError('\''+type_as_str(a)+'\' object cannot be interpreted as an integer')

        self.start, self.step = 0,1   # defaults
        if len(args) == 1:
            self.stop = args[0]
        elif len(args) == 2:
            self.start, self.stop = args[0], args[1]
        elif len(args) == 3:
            self.start, self.stop, self.step = args[0], args[1], args[2]
            if self.step == 0:
                raise ValueError('3rd argument must not be 0')
        else:
            raise TypeError('range expected at most 3 arguments, got '+str(len(args))) 

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'prange('+str(self.start)+','+str(self.stop)+('' if self.step==1 else ','+str(self.step))+')'


------------------------------

prange: implementing the iteration protocol

Now let's add the main functionality: the iterator protocol methods. They are
similar to but generalize what we wrote in the Countdown class.

    def __iter__(self):
        self.n = self.start # first value to return from __next__
        return self         # must return object on which __next__ is callable
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.step > 0 and self.n >= self.stop or\
           self.step < 0 and self.n <= self.stop:
            raise StopIteration
        answer = self.n
        self.n += self.step
        return answer

In this class, when __iter__ is called it (re)sets self.n (the value __next__
will return) to self.start (which never changes). The __iter__ method has a
requirement that it must return an object that defines a __next__ method. Here
it returns self, which is an object constructed from prange, which defines
__next__ (right below __iter__).

When __next__ is called it checks whether self.n has reached or exceeded
self.stop (different tests, depending on whether self.step is positive or
negative: self.step cannot be 0) and throws StopIteration; otherwise it returns
the current value of self.n but before returning it increments self.n by
self.step (by saving it, incrementing it, returning the saved value). We could
avoid the temporary name answer by writing the following code, but it seems
clumsy to me.

        if self.step > 0 and self.n >= self.stop or\
           self.step < 0 and self.n <= self.stop:
               raise StopIteration
        self.n += self.step
        return self.n - self.step

We discussed similar code in Countdown.

Try running various loops or comprehensions using prange objects to ensure that
this code perform like Python's built-in ranges.

------------------------------

prange: overloading operators

Now we move prange closer to Python's real range class by writing methods that
implement __len__, __getitem__, __contains__, and __reversed__. All of these
methods use some fancy mathematics to compute their results, so I won't discuss
here how these method work in detail (but I encourage you to examine them and
calculate examples). Note that __reversed__ just returns a new prange object,
but with different start/stop values and a step that is the opposite.

To run this code, I need to import math (to use the math's ceiling function:
returns an integer >= its float/int argument; ceiling(3.9) is 4).

    def __len__(self):
        if self.step > 0 and self.start >= self.stop or \
           self.step < 0 and self.start <= self.stop:
            return 0
        else:
            return math.ceil((self.stop-self.start)/self.step)
              
    def __getitem__(self,n):
        if n < 0 or n >= len(self) :  # yes, could be n >= self.__len__()
            raise IndexError(str(self)+['+str(n)+'] index out of range')
        return self.start+n*self.step
    
    def __contains__(self,n):
        if self.step > 0:
            return self.start<=n<self.stop and (n-self.start)%self.step == 0
        else:
            return self.stop<n<=self.start and abs(n-self.start)%abs(self.step) == 0
        
    def __reversed__(self):
        if self.step > 0:
            return prange(self.start+(len(self)-1)*self.step,self.start-1,-self.step)
        else:
            return prange(self.start+(len(self)-1)*self.step,self.start+1,-self.step)


------------------------------

prange: an alternative implementation (poor use of space and potentially time)

For my final topic in this section, I am going to rewrite an alterntaive
implementation of this class: one that uses __init__ to generate and store the
complete list of values that are in a range. I will then discuss the complexity
of the code and some  time/space tradeoffs.

In this code, the __init__ method computes and remembers start, stop, and step
(but only for use in __repr__). The code at the end of __init__ is a while loop
that explicitly iterates through all the values in the range, storing each value
in a list. (try to reverse the test and replace True by the continuation
condition for this loop).

Once we have a list with all these values, all the other methods are much
simpler to implement (they typically just delegate to the list methods to get
their job done) and require no complicated mathematics to write correctly. The
__iter__ method just delegates to construct an iterator for the list (defined
in the list class); The __next__ method is not defined in this class, because
the object returned by __iter__ is a list iterator, which has its own __next__ 
method defined in the list class. len, [], in, and reversed all work by
delegating to the list.

from goody import type_as_str
import math
class prange:
    def __init__(self,*args):
        for a in args:
            if not type(a) is int:
                raise TypeError('\''+type_as_str(a)+'\' object cannot be interpreted as an integer')

        self.start, self.step = 0,1   # defaults
        if len(args) == 1:

            if self.step == 0:
                raise ValueError('3rd argument must not be 0')
        else:
            raise TypeError('range expected at most 3 arguments, got '+str(len(args))) 
        
        self.listof = []
        self.n = self.start
        while True:
            if self.step > 0 and self.n >= self.stop or \
               self.step < 0 and self.n <= self.stop:
                break
            self.listof.append(self.n)
            self.n += self.step

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'prange('+str(self.start)+','+str(self.stop)+','+('' if self.step==1 else str(self.step))+')'
    
    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.listof)
    
    # no need to define __next__: __iter__ returns iter(list) and list defines __next__

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.listof)
              
    def __getitem__(self,n):
        return self.listof[n] 
       
    def __contains__(self,n):
        return n in self.listof
            
    def __reversed__(self):
        return reversed(self.listof)

So what are the tradeoffs between these two implementations? The list
implementation of the prange class is much simpler (except for the loop in
__init__ to turn a the range into a real list is 8 extra lines: 23 vs 15); it
requires no complex mathematics (but while such mathematics is hard for us, it
is trivial for the computer). This class can require a huge amount of memory
for storing a large range (e.g., prange(1,1000000000), while the original
pranges stores only 4 attributes (self variables). Also, __init__ takes a lot
of time to construct such a list (and we might not even iterate over all the
values in this prange). Finally, the __contains__ method here takes an amount
of time proportional to the range size (we will study why soon), to search for
the value in the list; whereas the original implementation computes this value
just by some quick arithmetic, independent of the size of the range.

As the quarter goes on, we will study efficiency more formally, but I thought
this was a good first time to bring up the issue, dealing with alternative
implementations for the prange class (and its iterator). Again, the main point
here is that the original prange COMPUTED the values in the range one at a time,
as needed, from 4 atributes; while the list version EXPLICITLY stored all the
values in a  potentially huge list.

Generally, new Python students often create extra data structures that are not
needed. For example, they read an entire open file into a list and then iterate
over that list, when they could just iterate over the open file: if the file is
huge, it might not fit in memory as a list; but iterating over an open file
just needs enough space to store one line at a time.

Although I've promoted "write simple code" in this course, we should start
thinking about some of the time/space issues of using Python. Often using
Python "efficiently" doesn't make the code more complicated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sharing iterators and Mutating objects that are being iterated over

Examine the following code

l = [0, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
x = iter(l)
y = iter(l)

print(next(x))
print(next(y))

print(next(x))
print(next(y))

print(next(x))
print(next(y))

It defines a list l, and constructs two iterator objects for the list: the
first bound to x, the second bound to y. Each call of next(x) refers to one
iterator object and each call of next(y) refers to another. Each call advances
the state of one iterator object. So identical values come out of each
iterator: the code prints 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2 (two 0s, 1s, and 2s)

Now change the code to 
l = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
x = iter(l)
y = x

Now x and y are bound to the same iterator object. Each call of next is on the
same OBJECT (whether next(x) or next(y)), which advances the state of that one
iterator object. So the print statements above print 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Finally, what do you think the following code will produce? The big question is,
does Python iterate over the values in l when the iterator is CREATED, or does
it iterate over the values of l at the time the iterator is USED? l might have
been mutated since the iterator was created.

l = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
x = iter(l)
l.append(10)

try:
    while True:
       print(next(x),end=' ')
except StopIteration:
    pass

The answer is that it, iterates over the values of l at the time the iterator
is USED. In this case it prints the integers 0 - 10 (including the 10 added to
the list after the iterator was created).

What if we change the loop to

try:
    while True:
        v = next(x)
        print(v,end=' ')
        if v == 4:
            l[4:7] = ('a','b','c')
except StopIteration:
    pass

It prints: 0 1 2 3 4 b c 8 9, 10. Although 'a' is added to position 4, the value
in that position of the list has already been iterated over (returned), so when
__next__ is called again it prints the value in the next position, 'b'. So any
mutation we make to a list while it is being iterated over can affect the
results of the iteration.

Now look at the following code; it causes an infinite loop (printing higher and
higher values) because for every iteration of the loop, a new value is added to
the list, increasing the number of values to iterate over.

i = 0
l = [i]
for x in l:
    print(x)
    i += 1
    l.append(i)

So, the iterator object for a list is keeping track of what index it is on, but
the list it indexes (from which to get these values) is also growing (its len is
increasing). We can avoid all these problems by iterating over a COPY of the
list. There are many ways to create copies of objects (see the copy module, for
example) but the easiest way to make a copy of a list l is by using the idiom
list(l) or even l[:]. If we replace

  for x in l:

 by

   for x in l[:]:  # or for x in list(l):

in the example above, only the original list's value (just one 0) is printed. Of
course doing so make a copy of the list (using more space).

It would be easy to write a variant of a list class whose __iter__ method always
makes a copy of the list to iterate over, so any changes subsequently made to
the list will not change the result of the iteration. Of course, a drawback of
that approach is that it requires extra space to "remember what the list
contained when the iterator started". When we study lots of iterators in the
next lecture, we will see examples of these kinds of classes. Of course, besides
the extra space it takes extra time to make a copy, but sometimes it is
worth it (to avoid the problems shown above).

Problems:

1. Is the following translation of a for loop also equivalent to the translation
of the for loop shown above? Argue they are equivalent of show an example where
they differ.

_hidden = iter(iterable)
while True:
    try:
        indexes = next(_hidden)
        block-body
    except StopIteration:
        block-else
        break

2. Write the class Random_N which is constructed with an integer argument and 
produces that many random values.

Problems:

1) Define a function named first, which takes any iterable and a predicate
function (takes one argument, returns a bool) as arguments, and uses a for loop
to returns the first value in the iterable for which the predicate is True; or,
it raises the ValueError exception if the predicate is True for none of the
iterator's values.

2) Translate the following iteration to use a while loop and explicit calls to
__iter__ and __next__.

for c in 'abcdefg':
    print(c)

3) Define a function named group_n, which takes any iterable and an int as
arguments, and returns a list of a list of the first n values, a list of the
second n values, etc. in the iterable; if the iterable raises StopIteration
before the last group of n values can be collected, ignore those. For example,
group_n('abcdefghijklmn',3) returns the list of lists:
[['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f'], ['g', 'h', 'i'], ['j', 'k', 'l']]

4) The fibonacci sequence is defined as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... where the
1st and 2nd fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1, and all subsequent numbers are the
sum of the prior two. Define a class named fib_range that is initialized by two
values (the index of the first and last fibonacci number inclusive), and whose
iterator generates all the fibonacci numbers in the range. For example, the
comprehension [i for i in fib_range(4,6)] creates the list [3, 5, 8]

5) Define a method named len_remaining which returns an int indicating how many
more values a prange iterator object will iterate over. Initially len and
len_remaining would return the same result, but for every time __next__ is
called,  len_remaining returns a value one less.

6) Re-examine the __reversed__ method in prange. Explain why it is incorrect to
simplify this method to the following: for what kinds of values does it work
and for what kind does it fail?

    def __reversed__(self):
        if self.step > 0:
            return prange(self.stop-1 ,self.start-1, -self.step)
        else:
            return prange(self.stop+1 ,self.start+1, -self.step)

7) Examine the difference between the following code and what is produced.

   	       		  	  c = Countdown(2)	  	  
for a in Countdown(2):		  for a in c:
    for b in Countdown(2):	      for b in c:
        print(a,b)		          print(a,b)

prints:				  prints:
2 2				  2 1
2 1				  2 1
2 0				  2 0
1 2
1 1
0 0
0 2
0 1
0 0

Explain why these results print as they do and find a simple way to modify the
Countdown class to make these two scripts perform identically. Hint: it relates
to a problem with sharing objects.
