You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing Eclipse.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely before performing the action that it
  describes.
This document shows downloading and installing Eclipse on Windows 7
  in Spring 2012..

<h2>Eclipse: Version 4.3 (Kepler)</h2>
<p>

The Eclipse download requires about 182 MB of disk space; keep it on your
  machine, in case you need to re-install Eclipse.
When installed, Eclipse requires about an additional 220 MB of disk space.
<p>

<h3>Downloading</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php" target="_blank">
      Eclipse</a>.<p>
    You following page will appear in your browser.
    In this handout we will download <b>Eclipse Classic 4.3</b> for
      Windows 32 Bit; if your computer uses Windows, continue below; otherwise
        look above the column of "green arrows" for the label
        <b>Eclipse Kepler (4.3) Packages for</b>
        and in the pull-down list to its right, choose either
        <b>Mac OS X (Cocoa)</b> or <b>Linux</b> and then continue below.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/eclipsedownloadpage.jpg">
    <p>

<p>
<li>Click the <b>32 Bit</b> Operating System for your machine
      (even if you know your Operating System is 64 Bits and even if you
      downloaded the 64 Bit version of Python), under the heading
      <b>Eclipse Classic 4.3 (182 MB)</b> (the second icon from the top).
    <p>
    You will see the following page (don't worry about the name of the
      institution to the right of the big downward pointing arrow).
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mirror.jpg">
     
<p>
<li>Click the big downward pointing arrow underneath the
      <b>Download eclipse-SDK-4.3-win32.zip from:</b>
    The site named here, in purple to the right of the arrow:
      <b>[United States] Georgia Tech Software Library (http)</b> is the
      random one chosen by the download page this time.
    <p>
    This file should start downloading in your standard download folder.
    This file is about 182 Mb so it might take a while to download fully if you
      are on a slow internet connection (it took me about 3 minutes over a
      cable modem).
    Don't worry about the exact time as long as the download continues to make
      steady progress.
    <p>
    The file should appear as
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/downloadfile.jpg">
    <p>
    Terminate the window browsing the Eclipse download.

<p>
<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Eclipse
      (and reinstall it later, if necessary).
<p>
<li>Start the <b>Installing</b> instructions directly below.
</ol>

<h3>Installing (for Java)</h3>

<b>Java should be installed before installing Eclipse</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Unzip <b>eclipse-SDK-4.3-win32.zip</b>, the file that you just
     downloaded and moved.
    <br>
    On my machine (running Windows 7), I can
    <ul>
    <li>Right-click the file.
    <li>Hover over the <b>IZArc</b> command from the menu of options.
    <li>Click <b>Extract Here</b>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/izarc.jpg">
    <p>
    If you do not have IZArc or an equivalent unzipping program, here is the
      web site to download a free copy of
      <a href="http://izarc.org/download.html" target="_blank">IZarc</a>.
    <p>
    Unzipping this file creates a folder named <b>eclipse</b>.
    You can leave this folder here or move it elsewhere on your hard disk.
    I recommend putting the downloaded file and resulting folder in the
       <b>C:\Program Files\</b> directory.

<p>
<li>Create a shortcut on your desktop to the <b>eclipse.exe</b> file in
      this <b>eclipse</b> folder: <img src="images/eclipse/eclipseexe.jpg">
    <br>
    On most Windows machines, you can
    <ul>
    <li>Right-press the file <b>eclipse.exe</b>
    <li>Drag it to the desktop.
    <li>Release the right button.
    <li>Click <b>Create shortcut here</b>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Now you are ready to perform a <b>one-time only</b> setup of Eclipse on
      your machine.

<p>
<li>Double-click the shortcut to Eclipse that you just created above.
    <p>
    The following splash screen will appear
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/splash.jpg">
    <p>
    and then a <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/workspacelauncher.jpg">
    <p>
    In the <b>Workspace</b> text box, your login name should appear between
      <b>C:\Users\</b> and <b>\workspace</b>, instead of <b>Administrator</b>.
    <p>
    Leave <b>unchecked</b> the 
      <b>Use this as the default and do not ask again</b> box.
    Although you will use this same workspace for the entire quarter (checking
      projects in and out of it), it is best to see this
      <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window each time you start Eclipse, to
      remind you where your workspace is located.

<li>Click <b>OK</b>.
    <p>
    Progress bars will appear as Eclipse loads.
    <p>
    Eventually the Eclipse workbench will appear with a <b>Welcome</b> tab
      covering it.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/welcome.jpg">

<p>
<li>Terminate (click <b>X</b> on) the <b>Welcome</b> tab.
    <p>
    You will not see the <b>Welcome</b> tab when you start Eclipse after this
      first time.

<p>
<li>Locate the workspace folder created in step 3
      (see <b>C:\Users\<i>yourname</i>\workspace</b>).
    <p>
    Download (right-click and <b>Save link as</b>)
      <a href="../introlib/introlib.jar">IntroLib: Course Library Jar...</a> 
      into the same folder that you are using as your workspace (or move
      this file into the workspace folder after downloading it elsewhere).
<p>

<li>Click <b>Window</b> (to the left of <b>Help</b> on the far right of the 
      line below this window's blue title <b>Java - Eclipse SDK</b>) and then
      click <b>Preferences</b>  in its pull-down menu, as shown below.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/preferences.jpg">

<p>
<li>Disclose <b>Java</b> by clicking the <b>+</b> in front of <b>Java</b> or
      double-clicking <b>Java</b> (after the +); the <b>+</b> changes to a
      <b>-</b>.<br>
    Disclose <b>Installed JREs</b> similarly.<br>
    The <b>Preferences</b> pop-up window should appear as follows
      (although the path under <b>Location</b> might be different on your
      machine).
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/discloseinstalledjres.jpg">

<li>Under the <b>Name</b> column, double-click
      the <img src="images/eclipse/jreicon.jpg"> icon.
    <p>
    The <b>Edit JRE</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/editjre.jpg">

<p>   
<li>Click <b>Add External Jars...</b>.
<p>
<li>In the <b>Jar Selection</b> window, navigate to your workspace folder,
      and double-click the file <b>introlib.jar</b>.
<p>
<li>Scroll down the <b>JRE system libraries</b> pane and
      observe the <b>introlib.jar</b> file now at the bottom.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/introlibadded.jpg">
<p>
<li>In the <b>Edit JRE</b> window, click <b>Finish</b>.
<p>
<li>In the <b>Installed JREs</b> window, click <b>OK</b>.
<p>
<li>Terminate (click <b>X</b> on) the Eclipse window.
</ol>
Eclipse is now installed for Java.
