problem has a curious history, described in Wells' <i>Penguin Dictionary
of Curious and Interesting Geometry</i>: Malfatti's original (1803)
question was to carve three columns out of a prism-shaped block of
marble with as little wasted stone as possible, but it wasn't until 1967
that it was shown that these three mutually tangent circles are never
the right answer.

in the pattern of a square lattice.
There is only one parameter to optimize, the angle of the triangle to
the lattice vectors; <A HREF="tripack.html">my answer</A>
is that the densest packing occurs when
this angle is 15 or 45 degrees, <A HREF="tripack.ps">shown below</A>.
(If the lattice doesn't have to be square, it is possible to get density
2/3; apparently this was long known, e.g. see F&aacute;ry,
Bull. Soc. Math. France 78 (1950) 152.)

<P>Asimov also asks for the smallest triangle that will always cover at least
one point of the integer lattice, or equivalently a triangle
such that no matter at what angle you place copies of it on an integer lattice,
they always cover the plane; my guess is that the worst angle is parallel
and 30 degrees to the lattice, giving a triangle with 2-unit sides
and contradicting an earlier answer to Asimov's question.

This is clearly
polynomial time: the decision problem can be solved by finding
the intersection of O(n<sup>2</sup>) shapes, each the union of two disks, so doing this
naively and applying parametric search gives O(n<sup>4</sup> polylog),
but it might be interesting to push the time bound further.

discusses an algorithm for constructing the Voronoi cells in a planar
lattice of points.  This problem is closely related to some important
number theory: Euclid's algorithm for integer GCD's, continued
fractions, and good approximations of real numbers by rationals.
Higher-dimensional generalizations (in which the Voronoi cells form
zonotopes) are much harder -- one can find a basis of
short vectors using the well-known LLL algorithm, but this doesn't
necessarily find
the vectors corresponding to Voronoi adjacencies.  (In fact, according
to Senechal's <I>Quasicrystals and Geometry</I>, although the set
of Voronoi adjacencies of any lattice generates the lattice, it's not
known whether this set always contains a basis.)
