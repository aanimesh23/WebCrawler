<i>Recent Advances in Constructive Cost, Schedule and Quality Modeling</i><br>

In the last two years there have been significant improvements in the
breadth,
depth and accuracy of the public, open Constructive Cost Model, COCOMO.
Following an explanation of the underlying COCOMO model concepts and
their
rationale, Dr. Boehm will explain where and how the models are evolving
and
expanding into the COCOMO Suite.  He will explain how both the accuracy
and the
applicability of the model have increased recently.

Software estimation models can play an important role in facilitating
the
balance of the three factors of Cost, Schedule and Quality. COQUALMO is
an
estimation model focusing on quality, but its ties to COCOMO II
provide
estimation models in the other two areas. Dr. Chulani will present the 
model and the initial results to date.

<b><i>CORADMO--Constructive RAD/Schedule Model</i><br>

<p> 

Many generic RAD techniques are applied to reduce schedule, sometimes
with an
accompanying increase in total effort.  One of the bases for this model
came
from a behavioral analysis of a set of RAD drivers suggested by a CSE
Workshop
on RAD.  Another component of the model comes from a staged schedule and
effort
distribution model based on Dr. Boehm's "Anchor Points" and the Rational
Unified Process model. The conceptual model has been implemented in a
spreadsheet that is linked to the output of COCOMO-II.1999.

<p>
Off-the-shelf software integration cost modeling focuses on estimating
the
cost, effort, and schedule associated with using commercial
off-the-shelf
(COTS) components in a software development project. Though still
experimental,
COCOTS is a model complementary to COCOMO II, capturing costs that
traditionally have been outside the scope of COCOMO:  (1) candidate COTS
component assessment, (2) COTS component tailoring, (3) the development
and
testing of any integration or "glue" code needed to plug a COTS
component into
a larger system, and (4) increased system level programming due to
volatility
in incorporated COTS components. COCOTS is envisioned as working in
concert
with COCOMO II to provide a complete software development cost estimation
solution.

<p>
Constructive Productivity-Improvement Model (COPROMO) is a Software
Engineering
Senior Management strategic planning decision assistant model.  It is
supported
by an implementation approach.  The model is based on the use of COCOMO
II and
CORADMO as valuation mechanisms.  The implementation approach uses a
representative application from the domain of concern to the senior
management,
and the identification of "technology" drivers and time frames.  Also, a
technology impact evaluation tool exists; one version of the tool has
been
implemented and used in the evaluation of the Knowledge Based Software
Assistant.

<strong>Biographies: </strong>
<br>
<b>Dr. Barry Boehm. </b>
Between 1989 and 1992, Barry Boehm served within the U.S. Department of
Defense
(DoD) as Director of the DARPA Information Science and Technology
Office, and
as Director of the DDR&E Software and Computer Technology Office.  He
worked at
TRW from 1973 to 1989, culminating as Chief Scientist of the Defense
Systems
Group.  Other positions include Rand Corporation culminating as head of
the
Information Sciences Department and General Dynamics.
<p>
        His current research interests focus on integrating a software
system's
process models, product models, property models, and success models via
an
approach called MBASE (Model-Based Architecting and Software
Engineering).  His
contributions to the field include the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO),
the
Spiral Model of the software process, and the Theory W (win-win)
approach to
software management and requirements determination.
