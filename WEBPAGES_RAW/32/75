<H2>Research Projects</H2>

<P>I finished my doctorate within the
<a href="/~taylor/software/soft.html">Software Research Group</a> here
at <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">UCI</a>.  Much of my work was done
under the auspices of the <A HREF="/pub/hyperware/">Hyperware</a> project
and collaborations with industry as part of the
<A HREF="http://www.isr.uci.edu/">Institute for Software Research</A>.
My research interests include
<a href="/pub/websoft/">global software engineering environments</a>,
software design, software architecture for network-based applications,
and application-level protocol design.
<A href="/~taylor/">Richard N. Taylor</A> was my advisor and dissertation
committee chair.

<P>I have been actively involved in the World Wide Web project since
1993.  I set up the original <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">UCI-ICS
WWW server</A> and created several <a href="#packages">WWW software
packages</a>,
and in early 1994 became involved in the effort to specify and improve the WWW
infrastructure through the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> working
groups on <a href="/pub/ietf/uri/">URI</a>, <a href="/pub/ietf/http/">HTTP</a>,
and <a href="/pub/ietf/html/">HTML</a>
(the set of protocols that were used to retrieve and view this document).

<P>I also co-founded the <A href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache
HTTP Server Project</A> and on the board of directors of
<A href="http://www.apache.org/">The Apache Software Foundation</a>.
We created the Apache HTTP server that currently dominates the general-purpose
server market with <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">over 60% of
the public
Internet websites</a> using our software.  Apache is my favorite example of
the power of global collaboration for the creation of software.

<P>My dissertation,
<em><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Architectural Styles and
the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a></em>, focused on
the rationale behind the design of the modern Web architecture and how it
differs from other architectural styles.

<H2>Life Story</H2>

What, you're still reading this?  According to most hypertext research,
you should have become bored by now and moved on to to another page.
Well, this is for those who are extra curious (or just have nothing better
to do).<P>

My background is a bit odd: I was conceived in 
<a href="http://nz.com/">New Zealand</A> and born in
<a href="http://www.laguna-beach.ca.us/">South Laguna</A>,
<a href="http://www.ca.gov/">California</A>. 
Although most of my schooling has been in the U.S., I was taught how
to read during a school term in 
<a href="http://nz.com/NZ/NZTour/Auckland/">Auckland</A>.
My <a href="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/econ/personnel/fielding/fielding.html">
father</a> is an emeritus professor in 
<a href="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/">Social Sciences</a> here at UC Irvine,
which is why I have been raised a Yank.  I was born in September 1965,
during the first week of classes of the year UCI was established, so you
might say that the two of us grew up together (except for the three years
I spent studying Physics and International Politics at
<a href="http://www.reed.edu/">Reed College</a>).  I am part 
<a href="http://nz.com/NZ/Maori/MainPage.html">Maori</A>,
<a href="http://xenon.stanford.edu/~rsf/kiwi.html">Kiwi</A>,
Yank, Irish, Scottish, British, and California beach bum.  Like I
said, a bit odd.

<P>
Most of the rest can be seen in my <a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/vita.html">vita</A>.

<P>I was a Visiting Scholar at MIT/LCS during the summer of 1995, working with
Tim Berners-Lee and the <A href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C)</A>.  You can also see my
<A href="http://www.w3.org/People/Fielding/">W3C Home</A>.

<P>
<a href="http://www.techreview.com/tr100/profile.php3?Fielding">I</a> was
named by <a href="http://www.techreview.com/">MIT Technology Review</a>
as one of the
<a href="http://www.techreview.com/tr100/">TR100: The top 100 young innovators
for 1999</a>. <i>"The 100 young visionaries who our editors and a distinguished
Panel of Judges feel have the greatest potential for technological innovation
in the 21st century."</i>  Gee, no pressure there.

<P>The <a href="http://www.acm.org/">Association of Computing Machinery</a>
recently awarded the <a href="http://www.acm.org/awards/ssaward.html">1999
ACM Software System Award</a> to The Apache Group for the Apache HTTP Server.
I talked a bit about that honor in
<a href="http://lw.itworld.com/lw-2000-04/lw-04-apache.html">an
interview with LinuxWorld</a>.

<P>On a more local note, I was named by the UCI Alumni Association as the
Outstanding Graduate Student of 2000.

<H2>Other Interests</H2>

I like playing games -- especially non-betting card games (Bridge,
Hearts, etc.) and obscure board games (british rails, naval war, etc.).
I also like playing basketball, softball, football and going fishing.
Mind you, I haven't had time to do any of these things since I started
messing with the Web.

<H2>Quotations</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
      What is life?  It is the flash of a firefly in the night.
      It is the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime.
      It is the little shadow which runs across the grass
      and loses itself in the sunset.<BR>

      <i>--- Crowfoot's last words (1890), Blackfoot warrior and orator.</i>

<HR size="4" width="50%">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
      To most readers it will be easy, after reading this tale, to accept
      Rover's theory that Man is set up deliberately as the antithesis of
      everything the Dogs stand for, a sort of mythical straw-man, a
      sociological fable.<P>

      This is underlined by the recurring evidence of Man's aimlessness,
      his constant running hither and yon, his grasping at a way of life
      which constantly eludes him, possibly because he never knows exactly
      what he wants.<BR>

    Life is a distributed object system.  However, communication among
    humans is a distributed hypermedia system, where the mind's intellect,
    voice+gestures, eyes+ears, and imagination are all components.<BR>
