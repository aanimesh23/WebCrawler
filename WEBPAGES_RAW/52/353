This replicator for rule
<A HREF="http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b3578s23/">B3578/S23</A>,
was found by Dominique Giard in 1999.  It replicates
itself every 12 generations, on a two-dimensional 4-unit grid.

Intriguingly, the same rule has two almost-replicators,
of periods 29 and 41, formed by placing two beehives end-to-end near
each other.

The same period 12 replicator also works in three other rules, of which
<A HREF="http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b3578s237/">B3578/S237</A>
has the most interesting small spaceships.
