In this project you are to write a Java program that 
builds the routing tables for all the
computers in a network, based on shortest-path routing.
The input for this problem is the connectivity information for the
network, given as follows:
<pre>
<i>IP_Address</i>: <i>IP_Address1</i> <i>IP_Address2</i> ...  <i>IP_AddressN</i>
</pre>
which indicates that
the computer at address <i>IP_Address</i>
can get to the addresses 
<i>IP_Address1</i> <i>IP_Address2</i> ...  <i>IP_AddressN</i> in one
hop, as in the following example:
<pre>
241.12.31.14: 241.12.31.15 241.12.31.18 241.12.31.19
</pre>
The routing table for the computer
at <i>IP_Address</i> is a set of pairs 
(<i>IP_AddressA, IP_AddressB</i>), 
which indicates that to route from <i>IP_Address</i> to go to 
<i>IP_AddressA</i> the next computer to send to (on the shortest path
to <i>IP_AddressA</i>) is <i>IP_AddressB</i>.
Your program should output the routing table for each computer, as
shown as follows (for the computer at address 241.12.31.14):
<pre>
241.12.31.14: 
	(241.12.31.15,241.12.31.15)
	(241.12.31.16,241.12.31.19)
	(241.12.31.17,241.12.31.18)
	(241.12.31.18,241.12.31.18)
	(241.12.31.19,241.12.31.19)
</pre>

<p>
Note: you may use the following class in your program:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html">
java.util.Scanner</a>
</ul>
You should read network topology connectivity information
from System.in and output the routing table for each address
to System.out.
