  <div class="toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle"><div class="wps_togglet"><span><a><b>Learning Safe Policies in Sequential Decision-Making Problems</b></a></span></div><div class="togglec clearfix">In online advertisement as well as many other fields such as health informatics and computational finance, we often have to deal with the situation in which we are given a batch of data generated by the current strategy(ies) of the company (hospital, investor), and we are asked to generate a good or an optimal strategy. Although there are many techniques to find a good policy given a batch of data, there are not much results to guarantee that the obtained policy will perform well in the real system without deploying it. On the other hand, deploying a policy might be risky, and thus, requires convincing the product (hospital, investment) manager that it is not going to harm the business. This is why it is extremely important to devise algorithms that generate policies with performance guarantees. </p>
<p> In this talk, we discuss four different approaches to this fundamental problem, we call them model-based, model-free, online, and risk-sensitive. In the model-based approach, we first use the batch of data and build a simulator that mimics the behavior of the dynamical system under studies (online advertisement, hospital’s ER, financial market), and then use this simulator to generate data and learn a policy. The main challenge here is to have guarantees on the performance of the learned policy, given the error in the simulator. This line of research is closely related to the area of robust learning and control. In the model-free approach, we learn a policy directly from the batch of data (without building a simulator), and the main question is whether the learned policy is guaranteed to perform at least as well as a baseline strategy. This line of research is related to off-policy evaluation and control. In the online approach, the goal is to control the exploration of the algorithm in a way that never during its execution the loss of using it instead of the baseline strategy is more than a given margin. In the risk-sensitive approach, the goal is to learn a policy that manages risk by minimizing some measure of variability in the performance in addition to maximizing a standard criterion. We present algorithms based on these approaches and demonstrate their usefulness in real-world applications such as personalized ad recommendation, energy arbitrage, traffic signal control, and American option pricing.</p>

Taking into account these constraints leads to new insights into the foundations of learning systems, and occasionally leads also to improvements for machine learning performed on digital computers. Learning in the Machine is particularly useful when applied to message passing algorithms such as backpropagation and belief propagation, and leads to the concepts of local learning and learning channel. These concepts in turn will be applied to random backpropagation and several new variants. In addition to simulations corroborating the remarkable robustness of these algorithms, we will present new mathematical results establishing interesting connections between machine learning and Hilbert 16th problem.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

We make two contributions to solving this problem: (1) We demonstrate that while the apparent spatial resolution of convolutional feature maps is low, the high-dimensional feature representation contains significant sub-pixel localization information. (2) We describe a multi-resolution reconstruction architecture based on a Laplacian pyramid that uses skip connections from higher resolution feature maps and multiplicative gating to successively refine segment boundaries reconstructed from lower-resolution maps. This approach yields state-of-the-art semantic segmentation results on the PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes segmentation benchmarks without resorting to more complex random-field inference or instance detection driven architectures.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

<p> In this talk, I will present my research that introduces new means to acquire, model, and render complex materials that are essential to our daily lives with a focus on fabrics. Leveraging detailed geometric information and sophisticated optical model, our work has led to computer generated imagery with a new level of accuracy and fidelity. In particular, we measure real-world samples using volume imaging (e.g., computed micro-tomography) to obtain detailed datasets on their micro-geometries. We then fit sophisticated statistical models to the measured data, yielding highly compact yet realistic representations. Lastly, we show how to recover a sample&#8217;s optical properties (e.g., colors) using optimization.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

We consider the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to solve the program, which provides a sparse solution that can be interpreted as inserting a hidden unit at each iteration. As a side benefit, this can be used to easily and efficiently identify an appropriate number of hidden units during the optimization. We also investigate different learning algorithms for conditional RBMs. There is a pervasive opinion that loopy belief propagation does not work well on RBM-based models, especially for learning. We demonstrate that, in the conditional setting, learning RBM-based models with belief propagation and its variants can provide much better results than the state-of-the-art contrastive divergence algorithms.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

In recent years, however, several methods have been proposed based on combining variational Bayesian inference and MCMC simulation in order to improve their overall accuracy and computational efficiency. This marriage of fast evaluation and flexible approximation provides a promising means of designing scalable Bayesian inference methods. In this work, we explore the possibility of incorporating variational approximation into a state-of-the-art MCMC method, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), to reduce the required expensive computation involved in the sampling procedure, which is the bottleneck for many applications of HMC in big data problems. To this end, we exploit the regularity in parameter space to construct a free-form approximation of the target distribution by a fast and flexible surrogate function using an optimized additive model of proper random basis. The surrogate provides sufficiently accurate approximation while allowing for fast computation, resulting in an efficient approximate inference algorithm. We demonstrate the advantages of our method on both synthetic and real data problems.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

We call this approach “dissociation” and give an exact characterization of optimal oblivious bounds, i.e. when the new probabilities are chosen independent of the probabilities of all other variables.</p>
<p>Our motivation comes from the weighted model counting problem (or, equivalently, the problem of computing the probability of a Boolean function), which is \#P-hard in general. By performing several dissociations, one can transform a Boolean formula whose probability is difficult to compute, into one whose probability is easy to compute, and which is guaranteed to provide an upper or lower bound on the probability of the original formula by choosing appropriate probabilities for the dissociated variables. Our new bounds shed light on the connection between previous relaxation-based and model-based approximations and unify them as concrete choices in a larger design space. We also show how our theory allows a standard relational database management system to both upper and lower bound hard probabilistic queries in guaranteed polynomial time.

For each patient visit (or episode), sensor data and lab test results are recorded in the patient&#8217;s Electronic Health Record (EHR). While potentially containing a wealth of insights, the data is difficult to mine effectively, owing to varying length, irregular sampling and missing data. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly those using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hidden units, are powerful and increasingly popular models for learning from sequence data. They effectively model varying length sequences and capture long range dependencies. We present the first study to empirically evaluate the ability of LSTMs to recognize patterns in multivariate time series of clinical measurements. Specifically, we consider multilabel classification of diagnoses, training a model to classify 128 diagnoses given 13 frequently but irregularly sampled clinical measurements. First, we establish the effectiveness of a simple LSTM network for modeling clinical data. Then we demonstrate a straightforward and effective training strategy in which we replicate targets at each sequence step. Trained only on raw time series, our models outperform several strong baselines, including a multilayer perceptron trained on hand-engineered features.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

This requires that language be grounded in perception and motor control.  I will present several components of my long-term research program to understand the vision-language-motor interface in the human brain and emulate such on computers.</p>
<p> In the first half of the talk, I will present fMRI investigation of the vision-language interface in the human brain.  Subjects were presented with stimuli in different modalities&#8212;spoken sentences, textual presentation of sentences, and video clips depicting activity that can be described by sentences&#8212;while undergoing fMRI.  The scan data is analyzed to allow readout of individual constituent concepts and words&#8212;people/names, objects/nouns, actions/verbs, and spatial-relations/prepositions&#8212;as well as phrases and entire sentences.  This can be done across subjects and across modality; we use classifiers trained on scan data for one subject to read out from another subject and use classifiers trained on scan data for one modality, say text, to read out from scans of another modality, say video or speech.  Analysis of this indicates that the brain regions involved in processing the different kinds of constituents are largely disjoint but also largely shared across subjects and modality.  Further, we can determine the predication relations; when the stimuli depict multiple people, objects, and actions, we can read out which people are performing which actions with which objects.  This points to a compositional mental semantic representation common across subjects and modalities.</p>
<p> In the second half of the talk, I will use this work to motivate the development of three computational systems.  First, I will present a system that can use sentential description of human interaction with previously unseen objects in video to automatically find and track those objects.  This is done without any annotation of the objects and without any pretrained object detectors.  Second, I will present a system that learns the meanings of nouns and prepositions from video and tracks of a mobile robot navigating through its environment paired with sentential descriptions of such activity.  Such a learned language model then supports both generation of sentential description of new paths driven in new environments as well as automatic driving of paths to satisfy navigational instructions specified with new sentences in new environments.  Third, I will present a system that can play a physically grounded game of checkers using vision to determine game state and robotic arms to change the game state by reading the game rules from natural-language instructions.</p>

Modern high-throughput technologies allow the measurement of concentrations of transcripts, metabolites, and other species along the circadian cycle creating novel computational challenges and opportunities, including the problems of inferring whether a given species oscillate in circadian fashion or not, and inferring the time at which a set of measurements was taken. Due to the expensive process of taking these measurements, inferring whether a given species oscillate in circadian fashion has proven to be a challenge. The sparse data with only a few replicates makes many existing methods unreliable. In addition, many differential gene expression experiments&#8211;such as those contained in the GEO repository, have been carried at single time points without taking into account circadian oscillations which can act as confounding factors.  To solve these problems we introduce two deep learning methods: BIO_CYCLE and BIO_CLOCK. BIO_CYCLE takes advantage of synthetic data to determine whether or not a signal oscillates in a circadian fashion, and infer periods, amplitudes, and phases. BIO_CLOCK, using a specialized cost function and real-world data, imputes the time at which a sample was taken, from the corresponding gene expression measurements.  These tools are a necessary step forward to better understand circadian rhythms at the molecular level and their applications to precision medicine.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

The first challenge is reducing the apparent gap in performance between code generated from high-level forms and that of hand-tuned code, which we address using extensive characterization of the optimization space for these computations and automating the process through domain specific code generators. These application-specific compilers provide the domain scientists the ability to productively harness the power of these large machines and to enable large-scale scientific simulations and big data applications.</p>
<p>The second challenge is analyzing and designing algorithms. We are entering the era of exascale.  The number of cores are growing at a much faster rate than bandwidth per node. What implications does this trend have in designing algorithms for future systems? If we were to model computation and communication costs, what inferences can we derive from such a model for the time to execute an algorithm? Our model suggests a new kind of high level analytical co-design of the algorithm and architecture and similar analysis can be applied in designing algorithms in general.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

In the past decade, driven by the ease of automatically collecting large-scale network data sets, there has been significant interest in developing new statistical and machine learning techniques for network analysis. In this talk we will focus on two general modeling themes in this context: the use of latent variables for low-dimensional  vector-based  network  representations  models  and  event-based  models  for temporal network data. We will review the representational capabilities of these models from a generative perspective, discuss some of the challenges of parameter estimation that arise, and emphasize the role of predictive evaluation. The talk will conclude with a brief discussion of future directions in this general area. </p>

In particular, custom topic models can be developed to answer specific research questions. The design of these models requires a nontrivial amount of effort and expertise, motivating general-purpose topic modeling frameworks. In this talk I will introduce latent topic networks, a flexible class of richly structured topic models designed to facilitate applied research. Custom models can straightforwardly be developed in this framework with an intuitive first-order logical probabilistic programming language. Latent topic networks admit scalable training via a parallelizable EM algorithm which leverages ADMM in the M-step. I demonstrate the broad applicability of the models with case studies on modeling influence in citation networks, and U.S. Presidential State of the Union addresses.

Training latent variable models is challenging due to non-convexity of the likelihood objective function. An alternative method is based on the spectral decomposition of low order moment matrices and tensors.  This versatile framework is guaranteed to estimate the correct model consistently. I will discuss my results on convergence to globally optimal solution for stochastic gradient descent, despite non-convexity of the objective. I will then discuss large-scale implementations (which are highly parallel and scalable) of spectral methods, carried out on CPU/GPU and Spark platforms. We obtain a gain in both accuracies and in running times by several orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-art variational methods. I will discuss the following applications in detail: (1) learning hidden user commonalities (communities) in social networks, and (2) learning sentence embeddings for paraphrase detection using convolutional models. More generally,  I have applied the methods to a variety of problems such as text and social network analysis, healthcare analytics, and cataloging neuronal cell types in neuroscience.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

We present and analyze the complexity of computing the residual (a.k.a. Bellman update) of the mini-bucket heuristic, which we call “bucket errors” and show how this can be used to identify which parts of the search space are more likely to benefit from look-ahead, therefore facilitating a method to bound its overhead.  We also rephrase the look-ahead computation as a graphical model to make use of structure exploiting inference schemes.  In our empirical results, we demonstrate that our methods can be used to cost-effectively increase the power of branch-and-bound search.</p>
<p> In the second part of the talk, we show how bucket errors can be used to improve the performance of AND/OR best-first search algorithms for providing lower bounds on the min-sum problem.  In our preliminary experiments, we show that when expanding nodes for the AO* algorithm, using bucket errors as a subproblem ordering heuristic can allow us to expand fewer nodes to arrive at the optimal solution compared to the existing ordering approach.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

Optimization methods, both convex and nonconvex are promising approaches to do this. In this talk I will review two classes of my work on prominent problems in convex and nonconvex optimization.  </p>
<p>Beating the Perils of Non-Convexity: Guaranteed Training of Neural Networks using Tensor Method: Neural networks provide a versatile tool for approximating functions of various inputs. Despite exciting achievements in application, a theoretical understanding of them is mostly lacking. Training a neural network is a highly nonconvex problem and backpropagation can get stuck in local optima. For the first time, we have a computationally efficient method for training neural networks that also has guaranteed generalization. This is part of our recently proposed general framework based on method-of-moments and tensor decomposition to efficiently learn different models such as neural networks and mixture of classifiers.  </p>
<p>Breaking Curse of Dimensionality: Stochastic Optimization in high dimensions:  We have designed an efficient stochastic optimization method based on ADMM that is fast and cheap to implement, can be performed in parallel and can be used for any regularized optimization framework with some mild assumptions. We have proved that our algorithm obtains minimax optimal convergence rates for sparse optimization and robust PCA framework. Experiment results show that in the aforementioned scenarios, our method outperforms state-of-the-art, i.e., yields smaller error with equal time.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

However, IS tends to underestimate the partition function and is subject to high variance when the proposal distribution is more peaked than the target distribution. On the other hand, &#8220;reverse&#8221; versions of IS and AIS tend to overestimate the partition function, and degenerate when the target distribution is more peaked than the proposal distribution. We present a simple, general method that gives much more reliable and robust estimates than either IS (AIS) or reverse IS (AIS). Our method works by converting the estimation problem into a simple classification problem that discriminates between the samples drawn from the target and the proposal. We give both theoretical and empirical justification, and show that an annealed version of our method significantly outperforms both AIS and reverse AIS (Burda et al., 2015), which has been the state-of-the-art for likelihood evaluation in deep generative models.

The multi-version code we consider ensures that, a decoder that connects to any c out of the n servers can recover the message corresponding to the latest common version stored among those servers, or a message corresponding to a version that is later than the latest common version. We describe a simple and explicit achievable scheme, as well as an information-theoretic converse. Moreover, we apply the multi-version code to one of the problems in distributed algorithms &#8211; the emulation of atomic shared memory in a message-passing network &#8211; and improve upon previous algorithms up to a half in terms of storage cost.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

Networks can be used to reveal underlying data structures, infer functional modules, and facilitate experiment design. In practice, however, size, uncertainty and complexity of the underlying associations render these applications challenging.  </p>
<p> In this talk, we illustrate the use of spectral, combinatorial, and statistical inference techniques in several significant network science problems. First, we consider the problem of network alignment where the goal is to find a bijective mapping between nodes of two networks to maximize their overlapping edges while minimizing mismatches. To solve this combinatorial problem, we present a new scalable spectral algorithm, and establish its efficiency theoretically and experimentally over several synthetic and real networks. Next, we introduce network maximal correlation (NMC) as an essential measure to capture nonlinear associations in networks. We characterize NMC using geometric properties of Hilbert spaces and illustrate its application in learning network topology when variables have unknown nonlinear dependencies. Finally, we discuss the problem of learning low dimensional structures (such as clusters) in large networks, where we introduce logistic Random Dot Product Graphs, a new class of networks which includes most stochastic block models as well as other low dimensional structures. Using this model, we propose a spectral network clustering algorithm that possesses robust performance under different clustering setups. In all of these problems, we examine underlying fundamental limits and present efficient algorithms for solving them. We also highlight applications of the proposed algorithms to data-driven problems such as functional and regulatory genomics of human diseases, and cancer.  </p>

To achieve this we propose a new objective function that encourages smoothness of inferred instance-level labels based on instance-level similarity, while at the same time respecting group-level label constraints. We apply this approach to the problem of predicting labels for sentences given labels for reviews, using a convolutional neural network to infer sentence similarity.

We propose a systematic framework to define and study the space of local learning rules where one must first define the nature of the local variables, and then the functional form that ties them together into a learning rule. We consider polynomial learning rules and analyze their behavior and capabilities in both linear and non-linear networks. As a byproduct, we also show how this framework enables the discovery of new learning rules and important relationships between learning rules and group symmetries.</p>
<p> Stacking local learning rules in deep feedforward networks leads to deep local learning. While deep local learning can learn interesting representations, we show however that it cannot learn complex input-output functions, even when targets are available for the top layer. Learning complex input-output functions requires local deep learning where target information is propagated to the deep layers. The complexity of the propagated information about the targets and the channel through which this information is propagated partition the space of learning algorithms and highlight the remarkable power of the backpropagation algorithm. The theory clarifies the concept of Hebbian learning, what is learnable by Hebbian learning, and explains the sparsity of the space of learning rules discovered so far.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

While these two BMI types are for different applications, they can both be viewed as closed-loop control systems. In this talk, I present our work on developing both these types of BMIs, specifically motor BMIs for restoring movement in paralyzed patients and a new BMI for control of the brain state under anesthesia. Motor BMIs have largely used standard signal processing techniques. However, devising novel algorithmic solutions that are tailored to the neural system can significantly improve the performance of these BMIs. Here, I develop a novel BMI paradigm for restoration of motor function that incorporates an optimal feedback-control model of the brain and directly processes the spiking activity using point process modeling. I show that this paradigm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in closed-loop primate experiments. In addition to motor BMIs, I construct a new BMI that controls the state of the brain under anesthesia. This is done by designing stochastic controllers that infer the brain&#8217;s anesthetic state from non-invasive observations of neural activity and control the real-time rate of drug administration to achieve a target brain state. I show the reliable performance of this BMI in rodent experiments.  </p>

N-body methods were identified as one of the original 7 dwarves or motifs of computation and are believed to be important in the next decade. These methods include FMMs, Treecodes, H-matrices, Butterfly algorithms, and geometric shattering. The relationship between these approaches is understood, but many of the demonstrated tools for developing and applying these algorithms remain ad-hoc, inaccessible, or inefficient.  </p>
<p> We present recent developments towards a codebase that is abstracted over the primary domains of research in this field and is optimized for modern multicore systems. Core components including tree construction, tree traversal, and low-rank operators are developed independently and parallelized for multicore CPUs and GPUs. Applications include dense problems in machine learning and computational geometry (k-nearest neighbors, range search, kernel density estimation, Gaussian processes, and RBF kernels), treecode and fast multipole methods in computational physics (gravitational potentials, screened Coulomb interactions, Stokes flow, and Helmholtz equations), and matrix compression, computation, and inversion (PLR, HODLR, H2, and Butterfly).  </p>

Yet, learning their parameters remain a challenging problem. In the first part of the talk I will present a novel approach to learning an HMM whose outputs are distributed according to a parametric family. This is done by decoupling the learning task into two steps: first estimating the output parameters, and then estimating the hidden states transition probabilities. The first step is accomplished by fitting a mixture model to the output stationary distribution. Given the parameters of this mixture model, the second step is formulated as the solution of an easily solvable convex quadratic program. We provide an error analysis for the estimated transition probabilities and show they are robust to small perturbations in the estimates of the mixture parameters.  </p>
<p> The above approach (and other recently proposed spectral/tensor methods) strongly depends on the assumption that all states have different output distributions. In various applications, however, some of the hidden states are aliased, having identical output distributions. The minimality, identifiability and learnability of such aliased HMMs have been long standing problems, with only partial solutions provided thus far. In the second part of the talk, as a first step, I will focus on parametric-output HMMs that have exactly two aliased states. For this class, we present a complete characterization of their minimality and identifiability. Furthermore, we derive computationally efficient and statistically consistent algorithms to detect the presence of aliasing and learn the aliased HMM transition parameters. We illustrate our theoretical analysis by several simulations.  </p>

Due to these variations, the effectiveness of employing a given resource – e.g., a sensing device or computing power – for gathering or processing data from a particular source depends on the nature of that source. As a result, the appropriate division and assignment of a collection of resources to a set of data sources can substantially impact the overall performance of an inferential strategy. In this expository article, we adopt a general view of the notion of a resource and its effect on the quality of a data source, and we describe a framework for the allocation of a given set of resources to a collection of sources in order to optimize a specified metric of statistical efficiency. We discuss several stylized examples involving inferential tasks such as parameter estimation and hypothesis testing based on heterogeneous data sources, in which optimal allocations can be computed either in closed form or via efficient numerical procedures based on convex optimization.

Examples include topic models for documents, hidden Markov models for speech, gaussian mixture models for point data, etc. The model parameters often give interesting semantic insights into the data.  </p>
<p> I will first discuss algorithms for parameter estimation in mixture models via the use of tensors, or higher dimensional arrays. The idea is to estimate (using the data) a tensor, whose decomposition allows us to read off the hidden parameters. Thus parameter estimation is reduced to tensor decomposition. Unfortunately, tensor decomposition is NP-hard in general. However, I will show that there exist algorithms that &#8220;almost always&#8221; work efficiently, in the framework of smoothed analysis, as long as the &#8220;rank&#8221; is at most a polynomial in the number of dimensions.  </p>
<p> Next I will consider the case in which we wish to learn mixtures in small (constant number of) dimensions. Tensor methods do not apply to this regime, and indeed, there are lower bounds which say that exponentially many samples are needed to &#8220;identify&#8221; the parameters. However I will show that under a slightly relaxed objective, we can obtain &#8220;PAC&#8221; style learning algorithms. This follows from a more general theorem about sparse recovery with \ell_1 error, which I will describe.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

By using a method called model compression, we show that shallow feed-forward nets can learn the complex functions previously learned by deep nets and achieve accuracies previously only achievable with deep models while using the same number of parameters as the original deep models. On the TIMIT phoneme recognition and CIFAR-10 image recognition tasks, shallow nets can be trained that perform similarly to complex, well-engineered, deeper convolutional architectures. The same model compression trick can also be used to compress impractically large deep models and ensembles of large deep models down to “medium-size” deep models that run more efficiently on servers, and down to “small” models that can run on mobile devices. In machine learning and statistics we used to believe that one of the keys to preventing overfitting was to keep models simple and the number of parameters small to force generalization. We no longer believe this &#8212; learning appears to generalize best when training models with excess capacity, but the learned functions can often be represented with far fewer parameters. We do not yet know if this is true just of current learning algorithms, or if it is a fundamental property of learning in general.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

In just the last few weeks, there have been successful hacking attacks against Sony and Anthem, as well as a banking attack by the Carbanak group that stole over $1 billion for various financial institutions. Traditional antivirus approaches utilize manual analysis of files to identify malware; however these techniques simply do not scale to the volume of malware that now exists. At the time of this writing, an estimated million distinct newly suspicious files per day are generated. Clearly, manual inspection of all these files by human analysis is not feasible.  </p>
<p> At Cylance, we have developed a machine learning engine to help reduce or remove the need for manual analysis. In this talk, we will dive in into various components of our machine learning infrastructure, with the goal of providing some insight into how one can apply machine learning to problems in industry and against large datasets. A machine learning approach to cybersecurity presents a wide array of interesting challenges in areas of feature extraction, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and modeling. Specific topics that will be discussed include designing models with speed in mind, why different optimization methods do or do not perform well against various types of data, and feature engineering based on wavelet analysis and entropy series.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

<p> We address the problem of long-term object tracking, where the object may become occluded or leave-the-view. In this setting, we show that an accurate appearance model is considerably more effective than a strong motion model. We develop simple but effective algorithms that alternate between tracking and learning a good appearance model given a track. We show that it is crucial to learn from the “right” frames, and use the formalism of self-paced curriculum learning to automatically select such frames. We leverage techniques from object detection for learning accurate appearance-based templates, demonstrating the importance of using a large negative training set (typically not used for tracking). We describe both an offline algorithm (that processes frames in batch) and a linear-time online (i.e. causal) algorithm that approaches real-time performance. Our models significantly outperform prior art, reducing the average error on benchmark videos by a factor of 4.  </p>
<p> Efficient Matching of 3D Hand Exemplars in RGB-D Images </p>
<p> We focus on the task of single-image hand detection and pose estimation from RGB-D images. While much past work focuses on estimation from temporal video sequences, we consider the problem of single-image pose estimation, necessary for (re) initialization. The high number of degrees-of-freedom, frequent self-occlusions, and pose ambiguities make this problem rather challenging. While previous approaches tend to rely on articulated hand models or local part classifiers, our models are based on discriminative pose exemplars that can be quickly indexed with parts. We propose novel metric depth features that make the search over exemplars accurate and fast. Importantly, our exemplar models can reason about depth-aware occlusion. Finally, we also provide an extensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art, including academic and commercial systems, on a real-world annotated dataset. We show that our model outperforms such methods, providing promising results even in the presence of occlusions.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

This work concerns learning the Mallows model &#8212; one of the most popular probabilistic models for analyzing ranking data. In this model, the user&#8217;s preference ranking is generated as a noisy version of an unknown central base ranking. The learning task is to recover the base ranking and the model parameters using access to noisy rankings generated from the model.  </p>
<p> Although well understood in the setting of a homogeneous population (a single base ranking), the case of a heterogeneous population (mixture of multiple base rankings) has so far resisted algorithms with guarantees on worst case instances. In this talk I will present the first polynomial time algorithm which provably learns the parameters and the unknown base rankings of a mixture of two Mallows models. A key component of our algorithm is a novel use of tensor decomposition techniques to learn the top-k prefix in both the rankings. Before this work, even the question of identifiability in the case of a mixture of two Mallows models was unresolved.  </p>

The model is robust to common parametric and semi-parametric assumptions in that it avoids simple distributional assumptions on longitudinal measures and allows for non-proportional hazards covariate effects in the survival component. Specifically, we use a Gaussian process model with a parameter that captures within-subject volatility in the longitudinally sampled biomarker, where the unknown distribution of the parameter is assumed to have a Dirichlet process prior. We then estimate the association between within-subject volatility and the risk of mortality using a flexible survival model constructed via a Dirichlet process mixture of Weibull distributions. Fully joint estimation is performed to account for uncertainty in the estimated within-subject volatility measure. Simulation studies are presented to assess the operating characteristics of the proposed model. Finally, the method is applied to data from the United States Renal Data System where we estimate the association between within-subject volatility in serum album and the risk of mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

Broadly speaking, structured prediction refers to any type of prediction performed jointly over multiple input instances, and has been a topic of active research in the machine learning community over the past 10-15 years. However, what has been less studied is how to model structured prediction problems for an interactive system. For example, a recommender system necessarily interacts with users when recommending content, and can learn from the subsequent user feedback on those recommendations. In general, each &#8220;prediction&#8221; is an interaction where the system not only predicts a structured action to perform, but also receives feedback (i.e., training data) corresponding to the utility of that action.  </p>
<p> In this talk, I will describe methods for balancing the tradeoff between exploration (collecting informative feedback) versus exploitation (maximizing system utility) when making structured predictions in an interactive environment. Exploitation corresponds to the standard prediction goal in non-interactive settings, where one predicts the best possible action given the current model. Exploration refers to taking actions that maximize the informativeness of the subsequent feedback, so that one can exploit more reliably in future interactions. I will show how to model and optimize for this tradeoff in two settings: diversified news recommendation (where the feedback comes from users) and adaptive vehicle routing (where the feedback comes from measuring congestion).  </p>

It could be shown that under separability of topics, \ell_1 normalized rows of the word-word co-occurence probability matrix are embedded inside a convex polytope, whose vertices correspond only to the novel words of different topics.

One of the main problems underlying graphical models is to infer the values of certain variables based on observations of other variables. Rigorous analysis of statistical inference algorithms can be very complicated even for relatively simple models. Instead, methods based on statistical physics of disordered systems provide a viable alternative. Here I will demonstrate the application of those methods on two problems, MAP estimation of Hidden Markov Models and Stochastic Block Models. The inference in both problems can become highly unstable due to a critical phase transition in the corresponding statistical physical system. Those instabilities are caused by frustrated (e.g., conflicting) constraints that are imposed on the inference objective. I will also discuss how one can mitigate this undesirable feature by active inference, i.e., by adaptively acquiring information about the (true) states of the hidden variables.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

These collective dynamics are not well understood and are expected to become more complex tomorrow as the grids are pushed to reliability limits, interdependencies grow, and appliances become more intelligent and autonomous. Tomorrow’s will have to integrate the intermittent power from wind and solar farms whose fluctuating outputs create far more complex stress on power grid operations, often dependent, e.g. in providing fast regulation control, on the gas supply. Conversely, one anticipates significant effect of the wind-following gas fired turbines on reliability of the gas grid. Guarding against the worst of those perturbations will require taking protective measures based on ideas from optimization, control, statistics and physics.</p>
<p> In this talk we introduce a few of the physical, optimization and control principles and phenomena in today’s energy grids and those that are expected to play a major role in tomorrow’s grids.</p>
<p> We illustrate the new science of the energy grids on three examples: (a) discussing an efficient and highly scalable Chance Constrained Optimal Power Flow algorithm providing risk-aware control of the power transmission system under uncertainty associated with fluctuating renewables (wind farms); (b) describing effect of the intermittent power generation on reliability and compression control of the gas grid operations; and (c) briefly discussing examples of interdependencies, reliability troubles and solutions in the low level (distribution) grids.</p>

This problem is relevant to many applications including detecting anomalies in sensor and computer networks, brain activity, co-expressions in gene networks, disease outbreaks, etc. Beyond its wide applicability, graph structured anomaly detection serves as a case study in the difficulty of balancing computational complexity with statistical power. We develop from first principles the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for determining if there is a well connected region of activation over the vertices in the graph with Gaussian noise. Due to the combinatorial nature of this test, the GLRT is computationally infeasible. We discuss two approaches, relaxing the combinatorial GLRT and a wavelet construction over graphs, to overcome this issue.</p>
<p> One such relaxation that we develop is the graph ellipsoid scan statistic, whose statistical performance is characterized by the spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Another relaxation that we have developed is the Lovasz extended scan statistic (LESS), which is based on submodular optimization and the performance is described using electrical network theory. We then introduce the spanning tree wavelet basis over graphs, a localized basis that reflects the topology of the graph. We show that using the uniform spanning tree in the basis construction yields a randomized test with performance guarantees similar to that of the LESS. For each of these tests we compare their statistical guarantees to an information theoretic lower bound. Finally, we consider specific graph models, such as the torus, k-nearest neighbor graphs, and epsilon-random graphs and show that for these graphs we achieve near-optimal risk consistency regimes.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

We study a simple communication-efficient learning algorithm that first calculates the local maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) based on the subsets of datasets, and then combines the local MLEs to achieve the best possible approximation to the global MLE, based on the whole dataset jointly. A naive and commonly used combination method is to take the linear average of the local ML estimates; this method; however, this has a sub-optimal error rate, and more critically, can easily break down in practical cases where the parameters are either unidentifiable (e.g., in  mixture models), non-additive, or have complicated structure. In this work, we propose a KL-divergence-based combination method that achieves the best possible error rate, and avoids weaknesses of linear averaging. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that our algorithm exactly recovers the global MLE under full exponential families, and its error rate on general distributions are related to how nearly &#8220;exponential family&#8221; they are &#8212; formally captured by Efron&#8217;s statistical curvature, originally defined by Efron (1975) to extend Fisher and Rao&#8217;s theory of information loss and second order efficiency of the MLE.  In addition, we show that the statistical curvature equals the lower bound of the asymptotic error rate of arbitrary combination methods, and hence represents an intrinsic difficulty measurement of distributed learning in this setting.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

This task is difficult for two reason: a) building an accurate pose detector is hard, and b) dependencies of body parts over space and time is hard to model or causes intractable computation.</p>
<p> This talk consists of two parts. In the first part, I address two key challenges in a common pipeline of pose tracker: 1) detecting small people and 2) extracting diverse set of candidate poses from each frame. I describe novel multiresolutional representation, motion descriptors, and inference algorithms to tackle these challenges.</p>
<p> In the second part, I propose the use of synthetic training frames as a mean to &#8220;overfit&#8221; a single video. Using a simple synthesis engine and detailed annotation of the first frame, we synthesize potential future video frames. We argue that this large customized training serves as an ideal training set relieving the burden of modeling, and provides us with insights on critical components of a working tracker.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

In this talk I will discuss a simple mathematical model for the exploratory data mining process that makes it possible to quantify how effective any given pattern (in the broad sense) is for this purpose. This quantification is naturally subjective, dependent on any prior beliefs the user may hold about the data. </p>
<p> While the proposed model is abstract and generic, it suggests practical ways for developing specific exploratory data mining methods that present patterns that are subjectively interesting to the user. I will illustrate this by showing how it leads to principled approaches for alternative clustering, for community detection in networks, and for association analysis in simple data tables as well as in relational databases. </p>

We demonstrate this using a simple linear regression example. We then introduce a test that can tell from the data whether we are heading for such a situation. If we are, we adjust the learning rate (equivalently: make the prior lighter-tailed, or penalize the likelihood more) in a data-dependent way. The resulting &#8220;safe-Bayesian&#8221; estimator continues to achieve good rates with wrong models. In classification, it learns faster in easy settings, i.e.  when a Tsybakov condition holds. The safe estimator is based on empirical mixability/exp-concavity, which generalizes an idea from worst-case online prediction. Thus, safe estimation connects three paradigms: Bayesian inference, (frequentist) statistical learning theory and (individual sequence) on-line prediction.</p>

By large, however, its theoretical underpinning has hinged on the stringent assumption that the learning environment is stationary. In particular, the data distribution on which statistical models are optimized is the same as the distribution to which the models are applied.</p>
<p> Real-world applications are far more complex than the pristine condition. For instance, computer vision systems for recognizing objects in images often suffer from significant performance degradation if they are evaluated on image datasets that are different from the dataset on which they are designed.</p>
<p> In this talk, I will describe our efforts in addressing this important challenge of building intelligent systems that are robust to distribution disparity. The central theme is to learn invariant features, cast as learning kernel functions and adapt probabilistic models across different distributions (i.e., domains). To this end, our key insight is to discover and exploit hidden structures in the data. These structures, such as manifolds and discriminative clusters, are intrinsic and thus resilient to distribution changes due to exogenous factors. I will present several learning algorithms we have proposed and demonstrate their effectiveness in pattern recognition tasks from computer vision.</p>

However, composing simpler optimizations is non-trivial because (a) the combination of possibilities that are available is large and (b) the fact that the effect of the interplay of basic optimizations to program performance is difficult to predict.  This talk will first briefly survey previous work on the application of machine learning techniques to construct program optimization strategies and second proposes a practical and widely applicable technique to construct program optimization strategies based on recommendation systems.

How well can they preserve the information in the data w.r.t. the output space? Algorithms especially in Machine Learning are required to generalize over input fluctuations or randomization during execution.  This talk elaborates a new framework to measure the &#8220;informativeness&#8221; of algorithmic procedures and their &#8220;stability&#8221; against noise.  An algorithm is considered to be a noisy channel which is characterized by a generalization capacity (GC). The generalization capacity objectively ranks different algorithms for the same data processing task based on the bit rate of their respective capacities. The problem of grouping data is used to demonstrate this validation principle for clustering algorithms, e.g. k-means, pairwise clustering, normalized cut, adaptive ratio cut and dominant set clustering. Our new validation approach selects the most informative clustering algorithm, which filters out the maximal number of stable, task-related bits relative to the underlying hypothesis class. The concept also enables us to measure how many bit are extracted by sorting, feature selection or minimum spanning tree algorithms when the respective inputs are contaminated by noise.</p>

Formulating the MAP problem as an ILP has led to the development of many approximate inference methods based on linear programming (LP) relaxations, including Tree-Reweighted Belief Propagation, MPLP and Max-Sum Diffusion.  Recent work suggests that going in the opposite direction and posing an ILP as a MAP problem may also prove beneficial. In this talk, I&#8217;ll focus on a classic combinatorial optimization problem, the weighted matching problem, and show that if it is posed as a MAP inference problem then the Max-Product Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm always converges to the MAP configuration. Remarkably, this is true even though the weighted matching graphical model is loopy and BP is neither guaranteed to converge, nor be correct in such models. I&#8217;ll then discuss a cutting plane approach to solving the weighted matching problem that utilizes the BP algorithm to iteratively tighten the LP relaxation of the matching ILP. This line of work improves our understanding of the performance of the loopy BP algorithm in general and further strengthens the theoretical link between message passing algorithms and optimization theory.</p>

The communication infrastructure is merging from a collection of distinct networks to a single super-network deeply integrated with heterogeneous sub-systems. Mobile health-care, smart energy grids and social networks are just examples of complex systems interoperating with the global communication infrastructure. Adaptive learning and control are the key to empower the next generation of communication networks with the ability to operate and interoperate in heterogeneous environments and with heterogeneous sub-systems. However, the high complexity of these systems discourages the use of traditional tools in practice. In this seminar, I will discuss a novel framework for online learning and optimization in complex inter-networked systems based on sparse approximation theory and wavelet analysis. The key observation is that communication protocols, and supposedly natural and human phenomena, induce a structured behavior of the stochastic process tracking the state of the system. This induces a regular structure at different time scales (hop number) of the graph modeling state transitions, and enables dimensionality reduction based on graph wavelet analysis and graph filtering. Sparse approximation algorithms can be then employed to dramatically reduce the number of observations needed to estimate fundamental control functions mapped on the state space of the observed system.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>

In recent years there has been an explosion in the amount of digital text information available, leading to challenges of scale for traditional inference algorithms for topic models.  In this talk, I will present algorithms for learning and evaluating topic models, quickly, accurately and at scale.</p>
<p> In part one of the talk I will describe SCVB0, a stochastic variational Bayesian inference algorithm which exploits the collapsed representation of LDA.  The algorithm can fit a topic model to Wikipedia in a matter of hours, and to the NIPS corpus of machine learning articles in seconds.  It is also extremely simple and easy to implement.</p>
<p> The second part of the talk considers the problem of evaluating topic models by computing the log-likelihood of held-out data, a task which requires approximating an intractable high-dimensional integral.  Annealed importance sampling (AIS), a Monte Carlo integration technique which operates by annealing between two distributions, has previously been successfully used to evaluate topic models.  We introduce new annealing paths which exhibit much lower empirical variance than the previous AIS approach (albeit at the cost of increased bias when given too few iterations), facilitating reliable per-document comparisons of topic models. We then show how to use these paths to evaluate the predictive performance of topic model learning algorithms on a per-iteration basis. The proposed method achieves better estimates at this task than previous algorithms, in some cases with an order of magnitude less computational effort.</div></div><div class="clear"></div>
