<h1>
Higher Lower Bounds from the 3SUM Conjecture
</h1>
<h2>
Tsvi Kopelowitz
</h2>

<p><i>Abstract:</i></p>

<p>The 3SUM Conjecture has proven to be a valuable tool for proving
conditional lower bounds on dynamic data structures and graph
problems. This line of work was initiated by P&#259;tra&#351;cu (STOC 2010) who
reduced 3SUM to an offline SetDisjointness problem. However, the
reduction introduced by P&#259;tra&#351;cu suffers from several inefficiencies,
making it difficult to obtain tight conditional lower bounds from the
3SUM conjecture.</p>

<p>In this talk I'll discuss the deficiencies of P&#259;tra&#351;cu's framework,
then give new and efficient reductions from 3SUM to offline
SetDisjointness and offline SetIntersection (the reporting version of
SetDisjointness) which leads to polynomially higher lower bounds on
several problems.</p>
