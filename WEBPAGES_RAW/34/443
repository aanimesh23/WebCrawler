<H3>Background</H3>

<p>The Applet Server allow Java applets to partcipate as full Chimera clients.  
Since applets can only communicate with the website where they 
were down-loaded from, the Applet Server allows for the Applet to 
interact as if it were a Chimera client communicating through a Chimera
Server in the user's environment.  This means that the Applets can act as 
clients in the user's environment dispite the fact that they actually can
only act through the Chimera website.  </p>

<p><b>Note</b>:  At this time, the Applet Server automatically comes up 
when the Hyperweb Manager is started.  The Applet Server will automatically 
start whenever it is deactivated by the <b>Quit</b> command in the
<b>File</b> menu, and there is a Hyperweb Manager running at
the Chimera website.  </p>

<p><b>Note</b>:  An Applet Server is started for each user using a 
Chimera enabled applet.  </p>

<H3>User-Interface</H3>

<p> The Applet Server's user-interface is contained within a 
window that allows its status to be visible.  There 
are no special operations available with the Applet Server.  </p>
