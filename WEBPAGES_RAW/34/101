<h1>The Rainbow Skip Graph: A Fault-Tolerant Constant-Degree
    Distributed Data Structure</h1>

<h2>Presented by Michael Nelson</h2>

<p>
Abstract:
<p>
We present a distributed data structure, which we call the rainbow skip
graph. To our knowledge, this is the first peer-to-peer data structure
that simultaneously achieves high fault-tolerance, constant-sized nodes,
and fast update and query times for ordered data. It is a non-trivial
adaptation of the SkipNet/skip-graph structures of Harvey et al. and
Aspnes and Shah, so as to provide fault-tolerance as these structures do,
but to do so using constant-sized nodes, as in the family tree structure
of Zatloukal and Harvey. It supports successor queries on a set of n items
using <I>O</I>(log <I>n</I>) messages with high probability, an improvement over the
expected <I>O</I>(log <I>n</I>) messages of the family tree.
