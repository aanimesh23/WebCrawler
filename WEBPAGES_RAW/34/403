He has asked your opinion about the systemfor running elections in Orange County.  He wants a system that is accurate,reliable, secure, convenient, and accessible to all voters.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>You will write a report of about four pages,giving your recommendations for how to organize voting in Orange Countyin a way that best satisfies these constraints.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>You can see from the registrar&#39;s web site,</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.oc.ca.gov/election/">http://www.oc.ca.gov/election/</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>,that Orange County currently uses eSLATE voting machines; the registrar&#39;ssite has a <A HREF="http://www.oc.ca.gov/election/eslate/background.htm">background page</A>and a <A HREF="http://www.oc.ca.gov/election/eslate/how_to_vote.htm">multimedia page</A>describing these machines.  Once you decide how best to handle voting inOrange County, you can relate your recommendations to the current system. Criticizing or commending the current system should not be your main focus,however; what the registrar wants is your overall recommendation of howto handle elections in Orange County.</FONT></P><BR><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Voting systems:</B>  A voting system (inthe broadest sense, including not just technology but the people involvedand the rules and procedures they follow) should have these qualities, amongothers:</FONT></P><UL><LI><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Voters find the system understandable andeasy to use without error, including inexperienced voters, disabled voters,older voters, voters with fixed work hours, poor voters, voters who can&#39;tcome to a polling place on election day, and voters whose native languageisn&#39;t English.</FONT></LI><BR><BR><LI><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Results are accurate (they correctly reflectthe expressed intent of the voter), invariant (repeated counts or queriesproduce the same results), and available quickly.</FONT></LI><BR><BR><LI><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Voting is secure (only eligible people vote,each person votes only once) and private (nobody else should be able tofind out how a particular voter voted).</FONT></LI><BR><BR><LI><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>More broadly, the system is fair and treatspeople equally; it does not give one group of voters any advantage overanother.</FONT></LI><BR><BR><LI><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>The public has confidence in the accuracy,security, fairness, and legitimacy of the system.  It&#39;s not enough thatthe system <I>be</I> all those things; the public has to <I>believe</I>that it has all those qualities.  They should not have to accept that itworks on blind faith; they should be able to see for themselves that itworks, or at least hear it from people <I>they</I> choose to trust.</FONT></LI></UL><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Your task is to design and describe a votingsystem that has these characteristics. Your design may not be able to satisfyevery criterion perfectly--if there were a perfect solution, it would alreadybe implemented and the 2000 election&#39;s problems in Florida wouldn&#39;thave happened (nor would the more recent problems in Florida and elsewhere). Be as thorough as you can in four pages, but don&#39;t panic if you hearthat one of your classmates discussed something that you didn&#39;t haveroom for.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>You should assume that your reader, Mr. Rodermund,is very familiar with the voting technologies available; you should notspend any time describing punched cards, optical scanners, touch screens,internet voting, cryptography, or any other technologies.  Your analysisshould focus on how the technology (or combination of technologies) yourecommend will meet the criteria listed above and satisfy the major constituencies(stakeholders):  voters, candidates, political parties, office holders,election officials, and the general public.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>There are no &quot;right answers&quot; tothis assignment.  The most important thing is that you describe how eachof your recommendations will improve the voting process, and how each aspectof your design will affect the various constituencies involved.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Stage I:  Decide on your recommendations(due Wednesday, April 14)</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>First, decide what systems and proceduresshould be implemented (or maintained, if they already exist).  Read theassigned articles, discuss ideas in section and with your classmates (perhapson the NoteBoard at eee.uci.edu), try to think of how each of the criteriaand each of the constituencies will be affected by what you recommend. We don&#39;t expect you to do significant outside research, but of courseyou may use any information you like, so long as you cite it properly. This is the part of the assignment that requires the greatest intellectualeffort and the most time--don&#39;t neglect it just because the writtenproduct of this stage (see below) is relatively informal.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Once you know what you plan to propose (includingthe reasons behind your choices and what effect you expect each recommendationto have), write them down in outline form and turn the outline in electronicallyvia Checkmate.  You must also bring a paper copy of your outline to a face-to-facemeeting you will schedule with Keri Carpenter on Wednesday or Thursday,April 14 or 15.  She will look over your outline to make sure you&#39;reon the right track.  (The outline and the meeting are required; your scorewill be lowered if you don&#39;t submit electronically and show up to yourmeeting.)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Be sure to keep the paper copy of your approvedoutline; you will need to turn it in with the draft and final versions.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Stage II:  Write your memo (due Thursday,April 29)</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Second, write your memo, following your outlineand the TA&#39;s suggestions.  Your memo should be about four pages long(in 10 or 12 point type, double spaced)--not less than three and not morethan five. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Content, organization, and clarity are moreimportant than precisely what format you follow.  However, your memo orreport must have a one-paragraph executive summary (a paragraph that startsout with the words &quot;Executive summary:&quot;) that lists your majorrecommendations. The executive summary appears at the top, but you don&#39;twrite it until after you write the body of the memo.  Mr. Rodermund is busy,and while you expect him to read your whole memo, the executive summarymay help him decide whether to read it now or later.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>This version will be graded; the TA will makecomments and suggest improvements.  Your grade for this part will count30% of your grade on the whole assignment, so it pays to do as well as youcan at this point.  Turn this in on April 29 (on paper at the beginningof class; electronically using Checkmate). </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Be sure to keep the paper copy of your gradeddraft memo; you will turn it in again with the final version.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Stage III:  Revise your memo (due Tuesday,May 11)</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Third, after your graded memo is returned,revise your memo, taking into account the comments of the TA.  This finalmemo will count 70% of the grade on the whole assignment.  Turn this inon Thursday, May 11 (on paper in class and electronically).</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>What to turn in:</B>  When you turn inyour Stage II memo on paper, include a copy of the outline you went overwith the TA.  When you turn in the paper version of your Stage III revisedmemo, include that same Stage I outline and your graded Stage II memo. Including your previous work is important context for the grading; to receivecredit, you need to turn in your previous work in the package.  Don&#39;tforget the other guidelines on the sheet of &quot;<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/139w/requirements.html">Writing Assignment Requirements</A>&quot;.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Other important advice:</B>  Based on students&#39;work in the past, we&#39;d like to suggest some things for you to consideras you work:</FONT></P><UL><LI><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Get your facts straight.  While we don&#39;texpect you to be perfect experts on voting technologies, you shouldn&#39;tmake claims that aren&#39;t true (for example, don&#39;t say that opticalscanners produce reliable, unambiguous results) and you should think throughyour recommendations and make sure they make sense (for example, don&#39;tassume that all voters have easy access to an internet-connected computer).</FONT></LI><BR><BR><LI><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Know your audience.  Use an appropriate tone--relativelyformal--when writing for a government official.  Avoid slang and humor. Don&#39;t tell the reader things she already knows (you can check withus if you don&#39;t know what might need explaining).</FONT></LI><BR><BR><LI><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Keep organized.  You should state each recommendationclearly; the recommendations should proceed logically from one to the next,describing the expected benefits and drawbacks of each in turn.</FONT></LI><BR><BR><LI><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Watch your wording.  Use a dictionary to makesure that the words you use mean what you want them to mean.  Use a writingguide (like <I>Writing from A to Z</I>) to make sure your sentences complywith the standard.</FONT></LI></UL><BR><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>We can expect to see more real-world proposalsfor voting reform in the next few months.  Having spent this time thinkingabout the issues, you&#39;ll be uniquely placed to comment on them.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Background on American elections:  </B>Ifpast classes are any guide, there may be some students who don't actuallyhave much experience with the American election system.  To help you getgoing on the assignment, here are some good sources of information. Thesereadings are not required; they do not have to be included in your notebookand they won&#39;t be tested on the exams.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#9C10B5"><A HREF="http://www.lwv.org/elibrary/nv/2000/voter_0900_9.html">http://www.lwv.org/elibrary/nv/2000/voter_0900_9.html</A></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>This short article briefly describes the mainvoting technologies available.
