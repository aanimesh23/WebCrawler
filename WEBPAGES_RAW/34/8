CEM1	YER061C	3-oxoacyl-acyl-carrier protein synthase activity	hexadecanal biosynthesis	mitochondrion	YPL073C		homology with beta-keto-acyl synthases	beta-keto-acyl synthase homolog	Null mutant is viable; exhibits respiratory-deficient growth
CEP3	YMR168C	DNA bending activity*	mitotic spindle checkpoint	condensed nuclear chromosome kinetochore	YJR060W		Cbf3 kinetochore complex binds CDE III centromere element; Cep3p contains an N-terminal Zn2Cys6 type	Cbf3 kinetochore protein complex subunit b	Null mutant is inviable; mutations within the zinc finger domain result in cells that exhibit a G2-M
