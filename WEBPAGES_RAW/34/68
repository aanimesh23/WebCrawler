Location:  ICS2-203 (my office:  put it underthe door)<h2>Team/Peer Appraisals</h2><P>The following team/peer appraisals will be used in part to determineappropriate project grades for each team member. Each team member<B>must individually </B>fill out a team/peer appraisal form.  Allstudents must submit this completed form toreceive a grade for the class.   You must submit the form in hardcopy,not email.</P><P>Please divide 100 points between your teammates according to theirlevel of participation in your team's project. Do not assign any pointsto yourself -- just to your team members. If you feel all members havecontributed equally, then assign each team member 33.3 points (assumingthere are a total of four members). If on the other hand, if you feelthat one member did far more work than all others and one member wasnot helpful, you might, for example, give the more active member 45 points, the lessactive member 20 points, and the other member 35 points. Please try tobe fair.</P><P>Also comment <B>briefly</B> on each team member's performance. Yourevaluation should focus on standard evaluation criteria, such astechnical competence, effort, productivity, creativity, quality,dependability, communication, initiative, decision making, andleadership.Please assign a number between 1-5, 1 being best ("outstanding"), 3 being ok ("meets requirements"),5 being worst ("unsatisfactory") for each teammate, for each attribute.</P><ul><li> competence: possesses or seeks required knowledge<li> Effort: tries to accomplish assigned tasks<li> Productivity: level of work generated<li> Creativity: conceptualised usful, innovativce approaches<li> Quality: demonstrates accuracy and thoroughness<li> Dependability: follows through on responsibilities<li> Communication: listens, expresses ideas/concepts<li> Initiative: seeks out new assignments<li> Decision Making: sets objectives, evaluates alternatives<li> Leadership: fosters good teamwork, solves team problems</ul><P>Your Name:__________________________________________________</P><P>1.
