      <p><b>What do you do on the project?</b> I have been working on designing and building the website and also maintaining our server.</p>

<p><b>How long have you been with the group?</b> For EcoRaft, I've been with the group since the beginning of the summer. I was also involved in the VirtualRaft project last fall.</p>

<p><b>Why are you working on the project?</b> Some of my own work involves web communities and web design, so this is a good way for me to build up those skills. I also think [EcoRaft] is an interesting project that's fun to work on.</p>

<p><b>What do you think is the overall goal of the project?</b> The goal is to create something that is both fun and educational.</p>

<p><b>What was your favorite part of [or working on] the project?</b> I really enjoy doing the website design. I also like doing the demos and seeing people have a great time with them.</p>

<p><b>What are your career goals/interests?</b> I don't know about goals yet, but I'm interested in web communities and online social interaction.</p>

<p><b>What are the other projects you've worked on?</b> In addition to my earlier involvement with the Virtual Raft project, I've worked on various web community design projects, as well as the beginning stages of an automobile interface evaluation and redesign project.</p>

<p><b>Have you gotten any awards and/or publications?</b> Not yet.</p>

<p><b>Any other questions and/or answers would you like on your site?</b> Not any I can think of.</P>
