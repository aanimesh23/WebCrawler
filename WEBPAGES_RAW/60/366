<h1>
Drawing Arrangement Graphs In Small Grids, Or How To Play Planarity
</h1>
<h2><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/">David Eppstein</a></h2>
<p>
We describe a linear-time algorithm that finds a planar drawing of every graph of a simple line or pseudoline arrangement within a grid of area O(n^{7/6}). No known input causes our algorithm to use area Omega(n^{1+eps}) for any eps  > 0; finding such an input would represent significant progress on the famous k-set problem from discrete geometry. Drawing line arrangement graphs is the main task in the Planarity puzzle.
