<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<p>Handling error conditions and gracefully recovering from such situations is a critical
area for any software product. It could involve handling of errors from attached hardware
or any other software component. However, it is not always possible to re-create all error
situations and test them. One of the mechanisms for testing the robustness of the code is
to inject errors and ensure that the code paths are covered. </p>

<p>This project will provide an opportunity for students to develop a GUI interface to
inject various errors in a client server environment. This will allow them to verify the
error recovery code in the client and the handling of invalid commands in the server. It
will also provide an opportunity for them to get an experience in inter process
communications.</p>
<b>

<h2>Background</b></h2>

<p>In any computer system the Input Output system is an essential element. All I/Os have
to be performed on attached devices. The IOPs written in the system have to handle various
error conditions possibly returned by these devices. In the Tandem Non-Stop fault tolerant
systems error recovery is one of the most critical areas of the code. We have to be able
to tolerate any single point of failure without impacting the customer applications. Thus,
it is essential for us to be able to test these various error situations.</p>

<p>One of the mechanisms to test these error conditions is to develop and use an error
injector tool. This would provide the capability to inject any error from a normal device
instead of trying to find devices that are broken and return various error conditions. </p>
<b>

<h2>Proposal</b></h2>

<p>To limit the scope of this project and to remove any dependence on a hardware
component, it is being proposed that a client server environment be used. Here are the
various components of the project: 

<ol TYPE="a">
  <li>A client that creates and sends messages for the server. (To simulate the operations
    performed by the IOPs it is suggested that the messages use the standard SCSI structures.
    This will also introduce the students to the SCSI terminology)</li>
  <li>A server that processes the messages from the client and replies to these messages.</li>
  <li>A GUI based error injection tool that injects errors specified by the user. It sends
    messages to the client to alter either the outgoing message to the server or incoming
    reply from the server. </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>By altering the outgoing message to the server, a normal command is changed and made
    invalid without changing the client software. This will test the behavior of the server
    and ensure that it can handle invalid commands.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>By altering the incoming response from the server, a normal reply is changed without
    changing the server software. The client believes that the response from the server
    indicates an error condition. This will validate and verify the error recovery code in the
    client software.</li>
</ul>
