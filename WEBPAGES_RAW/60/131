<H2> Abstract </H2>

Most documents made available on the World-Wide Web can be considered part 
of an infostructure -- an information resource database with a specifically 
designed structure.  Infostructures often contain a wide variety of 
information sources, in the form of interlinked documents at distributed 
sites, which are maintained by a number of different document owners 
(usually, but not necessarily, the original document authors). Individual 
documents may also be shared by multiple infostructures. Since it is 
rarely static, the content of an infostructure is likely to change over 
time and may vary from the intended structure.  Documents may be moved or 
deleted, referenced information may change, and hypertext links
may be broken. 

As it grows, an infostructure becomes complex and difficult to maintain. 
Such maintenance currently relies upon the error logs of each server 
(often never relayed to the document owners), the complaints of users 
(often not seen by the actual document maintainers), and periodic manual 
traversals by each owner of all the webs for which they are responsible. 
Since thorough manual traversal of a web can be time-consuming and boring, 
maintenance is rarely or inconsistently performed and the infostructure 
eventually becomes corrupted. What is needed is an automated means for 
traversing a web of documents and checking for changes which may require 
the attention of the human maintainers (owners) of that web. 

The Multi-Owner Maintenance spider (MOMspider) has been developed to at 
least partially solve this maintenance problem. MOMspider can periodically 
traverse a list of webs (by owner, site, or document tree), check each web 
for any changes which may require its owner's attention, and build a special 
index document that lists out the attributes and connections of the web 
in a form that can itself be traversed as a hypertext document. This paper 
describes the design of MOMspider and how it was influenced by the nature 
of distributed hypertext maintenance and requirements for the good behavior 
of any web-traversing robot. It also includes discussion of the efficiency 
requirements for maintaining world-wide webs and proposed changes to HTML 
and HTTP to support distributed maintenance. The paper concludes with a 
short description of MOMspider's future and pointers to its freeware
distribution site.
