Mechanisms for Efficient and Trustworthy Cloud Markets

<p>
Despite the increased adoption of the cloud computing paradigm, we do not
possess (yet) a good handle on how to define and verify "cloud
trustworthiness" -- how to design mechanisms that deliver SLA attributes along
dimensions of performance, reliability, security, privacy, and economic
utility, and how to expose tradeoffs along these dimensions to cloud customers
in ways that are both practical and usable. In this talk, I will summarize
research pursued under the BU CloudCommons project 
(<a href="http://csr.bu.edu/cc">http://csr.bu.edu/cc</a>)
aimed at addressing these issues, focusing on novel approaches seeking to
build trust in the economic utility of IaaS marketplaces. I will start by
presenting a periodic model for expressive specification of elastic cloud
supply and demand that allows provably-safe transformation of SLAs from one
form to another. Next, I will show that such expressive SLAs facilitate the
emergence of an efficient, trustworthy marketplace, by presenting three
game-theoretic mechanisms for cloud resource management. The first mechanism
enables rational tenants to collocate their workloads to minimize the
individual costs they incur to secure the shared cloud resources necessary to
support their application SLAs. The second mechanism enables rational parties
to coordinate their use of a shared resource so as to maximize their
individual utilities by creating a marketplace for trading usage rights. The
third mechanism uses dynamic pricing to ensure efficient utilization of
providers' resources, while guaranteeing rational fairness to all customers.
Time permitting, I will conclude with an overview the Massachusetts Open Cloud
(<a href="http://www.bu.edu/moc">http://www.bu.edu/moc</a>)
â€“ the first prototypical implementation of an Open
Cloud eXchange (OCX) that makes the adoption of these (and other) trustworthy
marketplace mechanisms possible in an operational setting.
