Priority Queues

MOTIVATION:
Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths from vertex s in graph G

def Dijkstra(s,G):
    tentative = dict mapping s->0, others->+infty
    final = {}
    while tentative:
        find vertex v minimizing tentative[v]
        for each edge v->w:
            if w not in final:
                tentative[w] = min(tentative[w], tentative[v]+length(v,w))
        final[v] = tentative[v]
        del tentative[v]

What data structure operations are performed?
(1) store and update tentative and final scores for vertices
    (here written as dict, could instead be attributes on vertex objs)
(2) keep data structure maintaining minimum tentative score

data structure mapping objects to values and keeping track of
minimum values is called a priority queue (or sometimes a heap)

basic priority queue operations:
- create new priority queue
- add item to queue (with given value)
- find smallest item in priority queue
- remove smallest item in priority queue

unfortunate terminology:
  priorities are called "keys"
  opposite meaning to dictionary keys

also used here:
- change priority of an item already in the queue
  (here, decrease key / increase priority)

useful in some other applications:
- remove non-minimal item (could implement change = remove + add)
- merge priority queues


Binary heaps
- array structure: x[i] >= x[(i-1)//2]
- tree structure
- new pq: queue = []
- add item: append then bubble up
- find smallest: queue[0]
- remove smallest: replace with last item then bubble down

Time per add/remove: O(log n)

How to use binary heaps for Dijkstra:
(1) maintain auxiliary dict mapping vertices to heap locations;
    update dict when items bubble up or down;
    decrease_key by changing value then bubbling up
time = O((m+n) log n), space=O(n)

(2) modify Dijkstra's algorithm so that it doesn't use decrease_key:

def Dijkstra(s,G):
    tentative = heap containing s with key 0
    final = {}
    while tentative:
        find and remove min object v and key d from tentative
        if v not in final:
            for each edge v->w:
                tentative.add(w, d+length(v,w))
        final[v] = d

time=O((m+n) log n) again, no extra dict, space goes up
(each vertex may be in heap many times)



SURVEY OF ALTERNATIVE HEAP STRUCTURES

Binary heap:
    add, remove, change key operations O(log n); find min O(1)
    very little overhead (single array of object-key pairs)

d-ary heap:
    like binary can be stored in array (condition: x[(i-1)//d] <= x[i])
    add-item, decrease_key O(log_d n) [fewer steps in bubble up]
    remove item O(d log_d n) [each bubble down step looks at d children]
    e.g. in Dijkstra, choose d ~ m/n gives time O(m log_{m/n} n)

leftist heap:
    unlike binary heap, allows merge operations

    instead of complete binary tree, allow any "leftist" binary tree
    (represented by nodes with left/right child pointers and height values)

    leftist = at all nodes, left subtree is deeper than right
	so to find shortest path to null pointer, follow right children
        (in particular right path has length O(log n))
    nodes store object-key values, decreasing towards root

    version 1:
        also store parent pointers per node

	to merge two leftist heaps, follow right paths
	(giving two sorted sequences of O(log n) values),
	merge the two sorted sequences to form a single tree,
	then swap left-right at selected nodes to make leftist again

        to add an item, make a new one-item heap and merge

	to delete an item with nonempty children,
        replace it with the merge of its two children

	to delete an item with no children,
	clear the pointer at its parent node and swap children if nec.

        to change a key, delete it and re-add the item

        => all operations O(log n), a little cumbersome

    version 2 (lazy):
        no parent pointers

	to delete an item, mark it as "deleted"
	to merge two heaps, make a new parent marked as "deleted"
	to add an item, make a new one-item heap and merge
	to change a key, delete the old key and add the new one

        but where is the minimum value?  no longer at root

	to find the minimum, traverse the tree finding
	paths of deleted nodes from the root, collecting non-del children
	then use non-lazy meld on all children

        => each op leads to O(1) marks => O(1) later melds
	so amortized O(log n) per operation

binomial heaps [ch.19]:
    alternative more complicated mergeable heap
    all operations O(log n)

Fibonacci heaps [ch.20]:
    heap allowing insert, delete-min (not arbitrary delete),
    decrease-key (not arbitrary change-key), merge
    
    all operations O(1) time (amortized for decrease-key)
    except delete O(log n) (amortized)
    so Dijkstra time becomes O(m + n log n)

    arbitrary delete and change-key could be handled
    by lazy deletion, O(log n) amortized each

    structure:
        forest of rooted non-binary trees
        heap-ordered (key[parent] <= key[self])
	all degrees <= log n

	represented by nodes with:
		parent
		child: arbitrary one of the node's children
		left, right: doubly linked circular list of siblings
                (left, right pointers of roots give list of all trees)
		degree (# of children)
		mark (boolean, true if lost a child since parent last changed)
	overall structure is represented by pointer to tree w/smallest root
	also store total number of nodes in the tree

    insert new item:
        make it into a new singleton tree
	add it into the circular list of tree roots
	change pointer to min root if new item is smaller

    find min item:
        obvious

    merge two trees:
        concatenate their list of tree roots
	set min root pointer to smaller of two min roots

    delete min:
	turn children of min into roots of new trees
	group roots by their degrees (e.g. bucket sort)
	while two roots x and y have the same degree, root(x)<root(y):
            make y into a child of x and update buckets

    decrease key:
        remove the item x from its parent's list of children
	    and make it into a new tree root
	do the same for the sequence of marked ancestors of x
	    until finding an unmarked ancestor, which gets marked
