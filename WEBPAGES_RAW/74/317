"<b>Controlling State Explosion in Reachability Analysis</b>"</A>,
by Wei Jen Yeh in PhD thesis, Purdue University, Department of
Computer Sciences, West Lafayette, IN 47907-1398, December 1993.


<H2> Abstract </H2>

Concurrent software systems are more difficult to design and analyze than 
sequential systems.  Considerable research has been done to help the 
testing, analysis, and verification of concurrent systems. Reachability 
analysis is a family of analysis techniques involving exhaustive
examination of the whole state space. Reachability analysis is attractive 
because it is simple and relatively straightforward to automate, and can 
be used in conjunction with model-checking procedures to check for 
application-specific as well as general properties like freedom from 
deadlocks and race conditions. However, practical application of reachability
analysis to real systems has been stymied by the state explosion problem, 
an exponential growth in the number of states to be explored as the 
number of processes increases. 

<P>

State explosion can be substantially controlled if the analysis approach 
is ``compositional.'' An analysis technique is compositional if the 
results of analyzing sub-systems can be ``composed'' to obtain analysis 
results for the complete system. We propose using process algebra to achieve
this goal in automated analysis tools. The algebraic structure of process 
algebra and its rich abstraction capabilities provide the means to achieve 
compositional (divide-and-conquer) analysis. 

<P>

The primary contribution of this dissertation will be a demonstration 
and evaluation of the usefulness of process algebra in controlling state 
explosion in reachability analysis of models close to the model of 
concurrency found in real programs. We propose a two-leveled approach
to control state explosion --- using process algebra at the coarse-grained 
level and simplification strategies based on a process-sleep mechanism at 
the fine-grained level.  Although the process algebra-based compositional 
approach is not guaranteed to solve the state explosion problem, with a 
suitably modular design that provides good service abstraction, state
explosion can be controlled sufficiently for application of reachability 
analysis to be practical.
