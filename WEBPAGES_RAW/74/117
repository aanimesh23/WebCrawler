Hexahedral Meshing</H1>

A major area of my research
has been in
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/gina/meshgen.html">mesh
generation</A>: decomposing complicated shapes into simpler shapes,
for applications including simulation of heat flows or other physical properties.
<P>
One type of decomposition I have been studying recently is
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/p-hexmesh.html">hexahedral meshing</A>:
decomposing shapes into cuboids.  For instance, this shape, known as the rhombic dodecahedron
<P>

<P>
can be decomposed into four cuboids:
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rhombs.gif" WIDTH=425 HEIGHT=407 ALT=""></CENTER>
<P>
However, it is still open whether a similar decomposition into cuboids exists for the following octahedron:
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="octahedron.gif" WIDTH=405 HEIGHT=495 ALT=""></CENTER>
<P>
Methods from my recent paper,
"<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/p-hexmesh.html">Linear
complexity hexahedral mesh generation</A>", and related work by Scott
Mitchell and Bill Thurston, prove that this octahedron can be meshed if
we allow the cuboids to have curved sides.  But it is not known whether
it can be meshed by straight-sided cuboids.
<P>
More generally, we would like to know under what conditions a hexahedral
mesh exists, and we would like to find algorithms that construct these
meshes whenever they exist.  Other research issues here include the
number of cuboids needed to mesh a given shape, and the quality of the
cuboid shapes.
