"Fast Approximation of Centrality"
(Joint work with David Eppstein) 
<br>
Speaker: Joseph Wang, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

<p>Social studies researchers use graphs to model group activities 
in social networks.  An important property in this context is the 
centrality of a vertex: the inverse of the average distance to each 
other vertex. We describe a randomized approximation algorithm for 
centrality in weighted graphs. For graphs exhibiting the small world 
phenomenon, our method estimates the centrality of all vertices
with high probability within a (1+epsilon) factor in near-linear time.

<p><b>Note</b>: this talk is to be
given as part of the Southern California Theory Day, so the
time will probably be different from the usual 1pm.</p>
