<h2>Puffers and Rakes</h2>

<p>Jason Summers and I independently discovered a small pattern
that acts like a period-38 c/2 "chaos puffer" -- it repeats after
38 generations with a chaotic mess behind it. It is shown below in
two forms; the larger one is more robust to perturbations, but
nevertheless is eventually killed off by the growing chaos behind
it. The third pattern below is a larger almost-puffer found by
Jason, that also eventually gets killed off by its own debris.</p>

</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>We don't know how to make a tame p38 puffer from these patterns.
Fortunately, by perturbing the smoke very early, Jason was able to
make <a href="glider.html">spaceships</a> of other periods, such as
8, 10, and 20:</p>

<div align="center">
<table cellpadding="15">
<tr align="center" valign="MIDDLE">
<td><a href="4c8.lif"><img src="4c8.gif" width="243" height="78"
alt="4c/8 spaceship"></a></td>
<td><a href="5c10.lif"><img src="5c10.gif" width="177" height="54"
alt="5c/10 spaceship"></a></td>
<td><a href="10c20.lif"><img src="10c20.gif" width="213" height=
"84" alt="10c/20 spaceship"></a></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>He also found another chaos puffer perturbation, with period
24.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="p24chaos.lif"><img src="p24chaos.gif"

<p>The p20 spaceship is easy to turn into a simple puffer that
puffs 2 or 4 tubs:</p>

<div align="center"><a href="p20tubpuf.lif"><img src=
"p20tubpuf.gif" width="219" height="84" alt=
"p20 four-tub puffer"></a></div>

<p>It proved to be difficult to turn this into a rake (puffer that
emits only gliders), but after considerable noodling around, Jason
came up with this p40 example:</p>

<div align="center"><a href="p40siderake.lif"><img src= 
"p40siderake.gif" width="273" height="351" alt=
"p40 sideways rake"></a></div>

<p>The rake about sends its gliders sideways, to the right. It
would also be useful to send gliders forwards and backwards. Period
40 is not large enough to build a forward rake. Using a 3c/6
spaceship, the rake can be thinned out to p120, allowing a forward
rake to be built. Jason thinks there's probably a better way to do
this; e.g. using p4 c/2 spaceships to turn the 2c/5 spaceships.</p>

<div align="center"><a href="p120fwdrake.lif"><img src= 
"p120fwdrake.gif" width="621" height="558" alt=
"p120 forward rake"></a></div>

<p>Period 80 would also work, but we don't know how to build a p80
sideways rake. Here's a way to build a chaotic "p80" puffer based
on de-phasing a p6 spaceship:</p>

<div align="center"><a href="p80chaos.lif"><img src="p80chaos.gif"
width="183" height="175" alt=
"p80 rake to chaos reaction"></a></div>

<p>Now that we have rakes, it should also be possible to use them to
construct <a href="breeder.html">breeders</a>. However, since these
rakes are unable to produce closely-spaced glider salvos directly,
one would either need to combine forward and back rakes to make
such salvos, or to use a <a href="construct.html">gun synthesis</a>
that allows the gliders to come in one-at-a-time.</p>
