<h1>
A Randomized Algorithm for Constructing the Trapezoidal Map Induced by a 
Connected Geometric Graph
</h1>

<h2>Darren Strash</h2>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
We discuss the general problem of constructing the trapezoidal map 
induced by a set of line segments in the plane, and present preliminary 
results for a randomized algorithm for the special case when the line 
segments form a connected geometric graph.

This is joint work with Michael Goodrich.
