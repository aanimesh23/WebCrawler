<div class=title>New Look-Ahead Schemes for Constraint Satisfaction</div>

<b>Abstract</b><BR>
This paper presents new look-ahead schemes for backtracking
search when solving constraint satisfaction
problems. The look-ahead schemes compute a heuristic
for value ordering and domain pruning, which influences
variable orderings at each node in the search space.
As a basis for a heuristic, we investigate two tasks, both
harder than the CSP task. The first is finding the solution
with min-number of conflicts. The second is
counting solutions. Clearly each of these tasks also
finds a solution to the CSP problem, if one exists, or
decides that the problem is inconsistent. Our plan is
to use approximations of these more complex tasks as
heuristics for guiding search for a solution of a CSP
task. In particular, we investigate two recent partitionbased
strategies that approximate variable elimination
algorithms, Mini-Bucket-Tree Elimination and Iterative
Join-Graph Propagation (ijgp). The latter belong to the
class of belief propagation algorithm that attracted substantial
interest due to their surprising success for probabilistic
inference. Our preliminary empirical evaluation
is very encouraging, demonstrating that the countingbased
heuristic approximated by by IJGP yields a very
focused search even for hard problems.
