<h1>Technical Interchange, Roundtable, and Networking Meetings</h1>
 
The success of the 
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/spin/spin.html">
Southern California SPIN</a> and 
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/bart/bart.html">
Bay Area Roundtable</a> 
have substantiated the need for, and benefits of, regular networking and 
roundtable meetings. An interesting aspect of these meetings is the 
significant value added by holding them on neutral grounds. This fosters 
the unrestrained sharing of ideas and experiences important to community 
development. IRUS will continue to initiate new technical interchange, 
roundtable, and networking meetings modeled after SPIN and BART as their 
need is identified by the IRUS

Executive Committee</a>. 
Potential topics of interest may be prototyped with 
<A HREF="focused_tech_symp.html">
Focused Technology Symposia</a>
to 
substantiate their relevance.
