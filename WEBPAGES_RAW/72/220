<LI> <B>Grading</B>
  <BR> Grading will be based on the following weights:
  <UL>
<!--    <BR>Midterm 20%, Final 30%, Quizzes 45%, Homework 5%.-->
<!-- <LI> You may view your ICS 6B assignment grades on EEE Gradebook -->
<!-- <LI> <B>Final Exam:</B> Wednesday of week 11 [Mar 17, 8:00-9:45am] -->
  <LI> <B>Quizzes (45%)</B> will be given in lecture
      on <B>Fridays</B> at the start of the class.
   (Any exceptions will be announced in class.)
   The lowest quiz score will be dropped when computing your quiz average.
  </LI>
  <LI> <B>Homeworks (5%)</B> will be due each <B>Friday</B>
  in lecture, gathered at the beginning of the class or together with quizzes.
  The lowest homework score will also be dropped when computing
    your homework average.
    <BR><em>(Homework grading policy: Homeworks are only graded on the scale 0-2, where 0 means no homework or clearly badly done one, 1 point is for most of the homework done seemingly correctly (this grade is assigned after a superficial examination of your solutions!), and 1 extra point is given for answering correctly a chosen exercise.  Homework solutions will be released on-line on the day before the homework is due.)</em>

<LI> <B>Text book</B> 

<UL> <LI> [Rosen] Kenneth H. Rosen, <EM>Discrete Mathematics and Its
  Applications</EM>, 6th edition, McGraw Hill, 2007.  <BR>This book is
  required, and it should be available at the UCI bookstore.
  <BR>Note: There is an online <A
  href="http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0072880082/299357/Rosen_errata.pdf">list
  of errata</A>.  <BR><em>You should read the sections of the book
  that pertain to the lectures and homeworks of the given week: The
  textbook will often cover the same material but with more detail,
  giving many more examples, and providing all sort of useful
  background material: You should always read the relevant sections of
  the book independently from attending the lectures and the
  discussion sessions!</em></LI>

  <LI> For those who are ordering the textbook on-line and still have
  not received it, here are the <A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~stasio/ics6b-s10/Chapter1Sections12.pdf">xeroxed pages of
  Sections 1.1 and 1.2</A> which we are covering in the first week of
  class (they include solutions to odd-numbered exercises in these
  sections!).</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
  <B>Add/drop policy</B> <UL> <LI> During the first two weeks, all
  adds and drops will be handled using the electronic add drop (EAD)
  system.  <BR>(In other words, I will not sign add cards or drop
  cards during the first two weeks.)  </LI><LI> Authorization codes
  are available only from the ICS Student Affairs Office.  <BR>I do
  not have any codes.  <!-- <LI> If for some reason you cannot add
  using EAD, contact me.  --> </LI><LI> I will sign add cards during
  week 3 only if there are slots still available (which is most
  unlikely).  </LI><LI> I will sign drop cards during weeks 4, 5, and
  6.  </LI></UL>

<LI> <B>Course announcements</B>
  <UL>
  <LI> Course announcements will be sent via email to the official
       UCI email address of all students enrolled in the class.  
<BR><em>(Send an email to the TA or the lecturer if you are not officially registered, e.g. because you are on the waiting list to register, and want to be on the email list.)</em>
  </LI></UL>
