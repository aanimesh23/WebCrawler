Section 3 of my document addresses security issues. The reality is that 
every versioning system out there has some sort of security consideration. 
More advanced ones like VSS provide a security resolution down to the 
directory level. If we do not provide support for security in the standard 
so that different clients can speak a generic security language we will end 
up with a versioning protocol that may be implemented but will be hidden 
behind a proprietary security wall. Security is ugly but we can not avoid 
it. We can not punt it. We either accept that it is an integral part of our 
lives or we stick our heads in the sand and watch the standard die as it is 
implemented in unconnectable islands surrounded by impenetrable seas of 
proprietary security protocols.

&gt;Microsoft Feature Support List (V 0.1, ALPHA, 8/26/96)
&gt;by Yaron Y. Goland (<a href="mailto:yarong@microsoft.com">yarong@microsoft.com</a>)
&gt;The following is the list of features which I have found that Microsoft
&gt;requires in order to express the full functionality of its products 
across
&gt;HTTP.

Many thanks to Yaron for making this informative posting!

To my mind, the issues described in Section 1, "File Control Features," 
are
both appropriate to versioning, and also to distributed authoring.  I'd
like to move discussion of these to the distributed authoring list,
<a href="mailto:w3c-dist-auth@w3.org">w3c-dist-auth@w3.org</a>.  Discussion of Section 2, "Versioning Control
Features," should definitely remain on the versioning list,
<a href="mailto:www-vers-wg@ics.uci.edu">www-vers-wg@ics.uci.edu</a>.

I'll be making follow-on posts on each section to these two lists.
