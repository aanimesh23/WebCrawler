<h1>CompSci 163/265, Spring 2015, Homework 8</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Let $G$ be a six-vertex graph formed from a square $abcd$ and a
triangle $cde$ that share an edge, together with one more edge $ef$
attached to the third vertex of the triangle. Describe the sequence of
all the recursive calls that would be performed by the pivoting version
of the Bron&ndash;Kerbosch algorithm on this graph. For each call,
describe the three sets given as arguments to the call, the pivot vertex
$u$ chosen by the call, the list of vertices $v$ corresponding to the
recursive calls that this call makes, and any maximal clique that is
produced as output by the call.</p></li>
<li><p>What are the degeneracy, $h$-index, and clustering coefficient of
the same graph $G$ given in the previous problem?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that we are generating simulated social-network data by
using the Barabasi-Albert method, with parameter $k$: we start with a
$k$-vertex clique and at each step add a new vertex connected to exactly
$k$
previous vertices (chosen with probabilities in proportion to their
degrees). Suppose also that we do this for exactly $9k$ steps, so that we
end up with a graph that has $10k$ vertices.
Define the diameter of a graph to be the largest unweighted distance
between any two of its vertices. What is the smallest possible diameter
of a graph that
can be generated in this way? Describe how a graph with this diameter
could be generated, and why no smaller diameter is possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the MathSciNet collaboration distance calculator to find five
mathematicians, whose collaboration distances from Paul Erd&ouml;s are
respectively 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. To find the distance for an author: go
to the <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/searchauthors.html">author
search</a> feature of MathSciNet (from a UCI IP address, so that you
will be given subscription access to the database), enter the name of a
mathematician, click on the "Collaboration Distance" link in the results
page, hit the "use Erd&ouml;s" button in the collaboration distance
page, and hit the search button. What is the shortest path from each of
your mathematicians to Erd&ouml;s? What is the largest collaboration
distance you can find in this way?</p></li>
