The Download and Installation Instructions were written for PCs. If you
are using a Mac, note the following differences.

1) Java it typically already installed on Macs. It can be downloaded
via the Software Update... option (possibly only for versions 10.6 and
beyond of Mac OS. Access it by clicking the apple on the top left.

2) The instructions require you to access Windows | Preferences, but on
the Mac it appears as Eclipse | Preferences.

3) Python on the Mac appears in the directory

  HD/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/bin/python3.3

which sometimes is written without the HD

  Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.3/bin/python3.3

Try both forms.

There will be multiple variations of the name python3.3 like pythonw3.3
and python3.3m, but make sure you select python3.3 (although I also
believe that python3 will work).

It has been reported that some student can use the directory

  //usr/local/bin/python3

which is an alias (shortcut link) to the file name mentioned above.

If none of these works and you find a different one, let me know and I'll add
it in this document.

Thanks to Tasha Lam for this information

You mentioned during class that you wanted us to email us if we had any sort of
error when downloading our software on a Mac. One problem that I encountered
and solved was that PyDev was nowhere to be found in my Preferences, as I
needed to do quite a bit of setup in the PyDev section. In order to fix this,
I had to uninstall the latest version of PyDev that I downloaded and
re-downloaded an older version (specifically 2.8.2.2013090511 which is the one
you downloaded in the step-by-step directions). In order to download this old
software, I had to uncheck "Show only the latest versions of hte available
software." This fixed the problem and I was able to change my PyDev preferences.
