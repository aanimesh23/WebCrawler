This is the abstract of my paper.  It must fit within the =

the text in italics, simply remove the 'em' command and =

the curly braces which bound the abstract text.  If you =

have em commands within an italicized abstract, the text =

will come out as normal (non-italicized) text. =

\section{Introduction}
Here is my introduction text.  There are 2 blank lines =

before the section heading and one afterwards.  Heading =

text is 12 point bold font.  Paragraphs are not indented. =

I may want a numbered subsection, which is done as =

follows.
\subsection{Previous Work}
In subsections there is 1 blank line before the section =

heading and one afterwards.  Heading text is 11 point =

bold font.  Paragraphs are indented one pica.  There is =

no blank line between paragraphs.
Throughout I may cite references of the form =

\cite{key:foo} or \cite{foo:baz}, and LaTeX will keep =

track of numbering.  The numbers are based on the order =

you place them in the bibliography, not the order they =

appear in the text.  They should (I believe) be in =

alphabetical order.  LaTex will put square brackets about =

the number within the text of your paper.  For those of =

you new to the bibliography package, you may have to run =

the latex process twice to allow all references to be =

resolved. You will get a warning about a missing .aux =

file.  Just rerun latex and it will be ok.
\section{Summary and Conclusions}
This template will get you through the minimum article, =

i.e. no figures or equations.  To include those, please =

refer to your LaTeX manual and the IEEE publications =

guidelines.  Good Luck!
%this is how to do an unnumbered subsection
\subsection*{Acknowledgments}
This is how to do an unnumbered subsection, which comes =

out in 11 point bold font.  Here I thank my colleagues, =

especially Mike Gennert, who know more about Tex and =

Latex than I.
