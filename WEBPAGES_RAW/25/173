doctor-patient 
contact, forexample, focus on the way the patient's symptoms and medical problem areconstituted in the doctor-pa
tient interaction . In his recent work, PaulAtkinson has broadened this approach to include, for example, discussionsbetween specialists (1995). Here also, however, the emphasis is on theconstitution of a patient's medical situation through <i>talk</i>
.<p>2. Many have taken similar departures before us: see e.g. Deleuze and Guattari(1988), Haraway (1991) and Mol (1993).<p>3. Hodgkin's Disease is a form of cancer of the lymphoid tissues. We start outwith a thought experiment since we want to convey 
the sheer impossibility ofclinical work <i>without</i> the record. Our fieldnotes have several instanceswhere the record was (temporarily) not available, and then the unwillingness toundertake any potential consequential action is always prominent. For
 stylisticreasons, however, we preferred introducing Mr. Wood immediately, so as not tointroduce confusion by presenting other patients.<p>4. Although they do not focus specifically on the medical record, the followingclassical studies provide valuabl
e insights on the role of time in medicalwork: Roth (1979/1963); Richman and Goldthorp (1977); Zerubavel (1979);Atkinson (1981); Horobin and McIntosh (1983); Frankenberg (1992).<p>5. For the notion of different, co-existing zones or orders of time see 
e.g.Kavanagh (1995), Frankenberg (1992), and Zerubavel (1979).<p>6. This refers to the bone marrow treatment: the bone marrow cells arereinfused after high doses of chemotherapeutics have done their toxic yethopefully curative work.<p>7 . In a study 
performed in Sweden it was shown that in 1975, coders disagreedwith doctors' attributions of rheumatoid arthritis 38% of the time(Fagot-Largeault, p. 228).<p>8 . In <i>Rewriting the Soul</i>, Ian Hacking (1995, pp. 234-257) discusses theproblem of usi
ng current categories - such as child abuse - to describe pastactions - such as Lewis Carrol's collections of pictures of children. When thecategory did not exist in social discourse, he argues, there is a real sense inwhich does not apply. Action, he 
argues, is always "action under adescription". By this he means that whenever we describe a past action, we onlyhave access to it through a set of constructed categories (a description). Thuswhen I seek to describe the behavior of someone I consider a 
"bully", thelatter category only fits the action within the context of my middle classlatter twentieth century definition of bullying - a nineteenth century Englishpatriarch might have seen someone with a "bit of backbone" (a description notavailable 
today...). Hacking's concern is to demonstrate that where there wasin the past no category of child abuse there was no abuse (even though, he isquick to point out, there might have been bad action...) (ibid, pp. 55-68).However his argument becomes much
 stronger when it is applied directly tosocial organization mediated by record keeping. Where there is no logging ofthe action of child abuse in a record within an organizational discourse, thereis no child abuse. Recording something as having been so 
makes it so -particularly when the record is itself the only trace of the past action.<p>9. These three dimensions are not to be taken as exhaustive or even asnecessarily central: they are dimensions in which the record's role is spelledout particular
ly clearly.<p>10. We wish to thank Bruno Latour for pointing out the the analyticalsignificance of the centrality of this legal aspect of record-keeping (personalcommunication).<p>11. One could say that a specific nursing record does exist - but that 
recordis hardly ever used for research, administrative and/or financial purposes.<p>12 . See also Goody (1977) and Latour (1987) on the power of writing andwritten traces.<p>13. As opposed to for example an ordering by means of a list of the patient's
problems, as in Weed's <i>problem oriented record </i>(1971).<p>14. With regards to the electronic medical record, it is tantalizing to asserta connection between the databases drawn upon and the work organization. Therehave been three major epochs in
 the development of databases: the hierarchical,the relational and the object-oriented (Khoshafien, 1993). All three are stillin use today - in medical and other databases. The hierarchical database echoesthe hierarchical organizational structure most 
favoured in the 1960s; therelational database echoes the more team model of the 1970s; and objectorientation is the nec plus altra of radical outsourcing. Organizationaltheorists have certainly drawn these connections: arguing a one-to-onerelationship
 between database structure and organization; with mismatchesleading to problems. Thus it has been argued that relational databases aresometimes problematic since `they have a flat, two dimensional view of theworld' (Stead et al. 1992). Although the co
mplex mediations we describe hereare unlikely to end up in any rigid repetition, the way a particular type ofstory gets told, enforced and mediated through different nodes in the networkis an important issue for further research.<p>15 . See Abbott (19
