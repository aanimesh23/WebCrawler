  abstract = {Most Information Retrieval Systems (IRS) that have been implemented
    to date have many restrictions imposed on the user for the convenience
    of the system programmer. Among these restrictions two common ones are
    (1) requiring the user to declare the structure of all the records beforehand,
    and (2) requiring the user to maintain a detailed knowledge of these
    structures at query time. A design for an IRS is proposed in which both
    of these problems are alleviated. A Relational Data Base System in the
    style of Codd's work is described that allows the data itself to define
    the structure of each stored record differently from every other record.
    At query time, the user is not required to have any knowledge of these
    structures, but merely be aware of the relationships that exist between
    the various data items. These relationships may be represented as a digraph,
    where the nodes model the data items, and the edges model the relationships.
    With this model, a query is equivalent to finding a given subgraph of
    a graph.}}

    of no more than $h^{3/2}n^{1/2}$ vertices of $G$ whose deletion creates
    a graph in which the total weight of every connected component is at
    most $1/2$. They exhibit an algorithm which finds, given an $n$-vertex
    graph $G$ with weights as above and an $h$-vertex graph $H$, either such
    a set $X$ or a minor of $G$ isomorphic to $H$. The algorithm runs in

    the many known applications of the Lipton-Tarjan separator theorem (1979,1980)
    from the class of planar graphs (or that of graphs with bounded genus)
    to any class of graphs with an excluded minor. For example, it follows
    that for any fixed graph $H$, given a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and

    set of $G$ up to a relative error of $1/\sqrt{\log{n}}$ in polynomial

    time $2^{O(\sqrt{n})}$ and solve any sparse system of $n$ linear equations
    in $n$ unknowns whose sparsity structure corresponds to $G$ in time $O(n^{3/2})$.
    They also describe a combinatorial application of the result which relates
    the tree-width of a graph to the maximum size of a $K_h$-minor in it.}}

    small subgraphs, within a given graph $G=(V, E)$. The randomized algorithms
    obtained using this method can be derandomized using families of perfect
    hash functions. Using the color-coding method we obtain, among others,
    the following new results: for every fixed $k$, if a graph $G=(V, E)$
    contains a simple cycle of size exactly $k$, then such a cycle can be
    found in either $O(V^\omega)$ expected time or $O(V^\omega\log{V})$ worst-case
    time, where $\omega<2.376$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication.
    (Here and in what follows we use $V$ and $E$ instead of $|V|$ and $|E|$
    whenever no confusion may arise.) For every fixed $k$, if a planar graph
    $G=(V, E)$ contains a simple cycle of size exactly $k$, then such a cycle
    can be found in either $O(V)$ expected time or $O(V\log{V})$ worst-case
    time. The same algorithm applies, in fact, not only to planar graphs,
    but to any minor closed family of graphs which is not the family of all
    graphs. If a graph $G=(V, E)$ contains a subgraph isomorphic to a bounded
    tree-width graph $H=(V_H,E_H)$ where $|V_H|=O(\log{V})$, then such a
    copy of $H$ can be found in polynomial time. This was not previously
    known even if $H$ were just a path of length $O(\log{V})$. These results
    improve upon previous results of many authors. The third result resolves
    in the affirmative a conjecture that the LOG PATH problem is in P. We
    can even show that the LOG PATH problem is in NC.}}

    authors show that $G$ is never a spanning subgraph of $D$ when $n$ is
    greater than three or when $n$ equals three and $m$ is greater than two.
    For $n=3$ and $m=2$, the authors can show for wide classes of graphs
    that $G$ cannot be a spanning subgraph of $D$. In particular, these non-existence
    results imply that $D_B(n)$ never contains a torus (i.e., the Cartesian
    product of $m\ge 2$ cycles) as a spanning subgraph when $n$ is greater
    than two. For $n=2$ the situation is quite different: the authors present

    The DARC system allows a coherent approach to substructure search, structure-activity
    correlation, and computer-aided design by defining relationships between
    the notions of substructure, structure, and family of structures. The
    substructure search is based on the concept of fuzziness: it is expressed
    in terms of subgraph isomorphism between a set of fuzzy graphs and a
    set of graphs. The file to be searched is processed by an automat which
    generates multilevel fuzzy graphs corresponding to local descriptions
    of the defined structures. The DARC descriptions of these graphs are
    stored in a tree structure. The same process is applied to the fuzzy
    graph of a query. As a result of this approach, the user language is
    the natural language of the chemist: free drawing of the substructural
    diagram with no use of a dictionary for the search. The retrieved structures
    can be displayed on a graphic terminal. These principles have been applied
    to the full CAS Registry Structure File and have made possible, for the
    first time, online substructure searches on 5 million compounds (EURECAS).

    achieves almost linear speedup in the processing rate of search tree
    nodes. However, the speedup of isomorphism detection rate is poor when
    looking for few isomorphisms, and good only when looking for many isomorphisms.
    We present an analysis of why we believe this property is intrinsic to
    algorithms that parallelize the tree search without parallelizing the
    node computations. We also discuss the effectiveness of the Butterfly
    architecture and programming environment in implementing such parallel

  abstract = {Applications typically have several potential sources of parallelism,
    and in choosing a particular parallelization, the programmer must balance
    the benefits of each source of parallelism with the corresponding overhead.
    The trade-offs are often difficult to analyze, as they may depend on
    the hardware architecture, software environment, input data, and properties
    of the algorithm. An example of this dilemma occurs in a wide range of
    problems that involve processing trees, wherein processors can be assigned
    either to separate subtrees, or to parallelizing the work performed on
    individual tree nodes. We explore the complexity of the trade-offs involved
    in this decision by considering alternative parallelizations of combinatorial
    search, examining the factors that determine the best-performing implementation
    for this important class of problems. Using subgraph isomorphism as a
    representative search problem, we show how the density of the solution
    space, the number of solutions desired, the number of available processors,
    and the underlying architecture all affect the choice of an efficient
    parallelization. Our experiments, which span seven different shared-memory
    multiprocessors and a wide range of input graphs, indicate that relative
    performance depends on each of these factors. On some machines and for
    some inputs, a sequential depth-first search of the solution space, applying
    simple loop-level parallelism at each node in the search tree, performs
    best. On other machines or other inputs, parallel tree search performs
    best. In still other cases, a hybrid solution, containing both parallel
    tree search and loop parallelism, works best. We present a quantitative
    analysis that explains these results and present experimental data culled
    from thousands of program executions that validates the analysis.}}

    Uniform representations and graphs of structural descriptions and rules
    are introduced. An abstraction of a set of uniform representations corresponds
    to a common subgraph of the corresponding uniform graphs. Every rule
    F=((for all $x_1,\ldots,x_n$)$C(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ to $R(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$)
    which can be induced from a training set $I=((C_i,R_i): i=1,\ldots,N)$
    of contingency-response (input-output) pairs is identified with a common
    subgraph of the uniform graphs of the causal inferences $C_i$ to $R_i$.
    A general learning problem is formulated for which three cases are distinguishable
    on the basis of if and how substitutions from input to output patterns
    are to be made. Category (unary) and $n$-ary predicate learning in this
    framework are discussed. Examples of rule learning applications are drawn
    from the domains of transformational grammar. The properties (both desirable
    and undesirable) of the proposed approach and the differences between
    it and previous approaches are also considered.}}

    Both the reference symbols and the sketches to be analysed were described
    by undirected graphs, their lines corresponding to the edges and the
    endpoint clusters of the lines to the vertices of the graph. Thus, for
    each connected component of a given reference symbol, pattern recognition
    can be done by subgraph isomorphism. This recognition access was very
    fast, but subgraph isomorphism means exact graph matching, and so it
    can fail, if the symbol representation in the image is disturbed-e.g.
    by merging or interrupted lines. Hence, Kuner and Ueberreiter (1986)
    derived a more general subgraph matching concept which has been proven
    already very reliable even for strongly disturbed images. The matches
    obtained by this approach are locally optimal but need no longer be exact.
    In this paper the author introduces this matching model once again and
    additionally, another one. Both can be formulated by quadratic assignment
    problems, a well known tool in OR science. Then, the author shows the

  summary = {This paper consists of two independent sections. In Section
    1, two refinements of a unique algorithm of J. R. Ullmann \cite{Ull-JACM-76}
    for the (general) subgraph isomorphism problem are given. One of the
    refinements relies on an algorithm for maximum matchings in bipartite
    graphs and develops the main idea of Ullmann's algorithm. In Section
    2, an algorithm for determining the number of subgraphs of the input
    graph that are so-called monotonically or cyclically isomorphic to a
    fixed pattern graph is presented. The algorithm is described in terms
    of certain pebbling games. For the $n$-vertex input graph it runs in
    time $O((m^n)n^2)$ provided the pattern graph has so-called $m$-pebbling.
    The constant $m$ can be small for the pattern graphs which are members
    of classes of graphs with good separator theorems [C. E. Leiserson, 21st
    Symp. Foundations of Computer Science (1980), pp. 270--281, MR 81i:68008;
    R. J. Lipton and R. E. Tarjan, Proc. Conf. Theoretical Computer Science
    (1977), pp. 1 - 10, MR 58{\#}21852]. Hence, it is concluded that if a graph
    $G$ is a member of such a class of graphs then there is a graph $G^*$
    satisfying the following two conditions: (a) $G^*$ is isomorphic to $G$,
    (b) the algorithm with $G^*$ as the pattern graph is much faster than
    exhaustive search. For instance, if $G$ is a planar graph on $k$ vertices
    then we can test whether the graph $G^*$ can be monotonically embedded
    in another graph on $n$ vertices in $O((cradlink limn))$ steps whereas
    exhaustive search requires $\Omega(k^n)$ steps.}}

    The problem to be solved is to find a subgraph isomorphism from an input
    graph, which is given on-line, to any of the model graphs. The new method
    is based on an intensive preprocessing step in which the model graphs
    are used to create a {\em decision tree}. At run time, the input graph
    is then classified by the decision tree and all model graphs for which
    there exists a subgraph isomorphism from the input graph are detected.
    If we neglect the time needed for preprocessing, the computational complexity
    of the new subgraph isomorphism algorithm is only quadratic in the number
    of input graph vertices. Furthermore, it is independent of the number
    of model graphs and the number of edges in any of the graphs. However,
    the decision tree that is constructed in the preprocessing step may grow
    exponentially with the number of vertices of the model graphs. Therefore,

    and column constraints of the permutation matrix are satisfied separately
    and Lagrange multipliers are used to equate the two 'solutions'. A fixpoint
    preserving transformation is applied to the graph matching constraint.
    A symmetry-breaking term is added in order to obtain a permutation matrix

    network performs minimization with respect to the Lagrange parameters
    and maximization with respect to the match matrix variables. Simulation

    the order defined by the matching quality. Each subgraph that is recognized
    is introduced as a node in a direct net that compiles different alternatives
    of interpretation of the features in the feature graph. A path in the
    net represents a consistent succession of characters in the word. The

    underlined. A final search for the optimal path under certain criteria
    gives the best interpretation of the word features. The character recognizer
    uses a flexible matching between the features and a flexible grouping
    of the individual features to be matched. Broken characters are recognized
    by looking for gaps between features that may be interpreted as part
    of a character. Touching characters are recognized because the matching
    allows non-matched adjacent features. The recognition results of this

  abstract = {The authors present an object recognition system consisting
    of a preprocessing part and a matching part. In the preprocessing step,
    the scene is decomposed into an assembly of sticks which are described
    as nodes in graphs. Nodes are connected with directed arcs if the corresponding
    sticks are connected in the scene. Parameters associated with an arc
    relate to the angle formed by the two sticks and the ratio of their lengths.
    In this way, the scene is described by a number of disconnected graphs
    which are matched against a number of stored model graphs. The matching
    itself is performed using a recurrent network in which the activations
    of neurons correspond to the certainty of a match between a stick in
    the scene and a stick in the model base. The recognition is independent
    of rotation, translation and scale, and insensitive to perspective or
    other distortions. The system was tested in the recognition of industrial
    parts. Scenes of varying image quality consisted of single or multiple
    objects and also including overlapping pieces. A systematic performance
    test highlights strong and weak points of this approach.}}

    the approach is both sound and complete. Our method uses the adjacency
    information between faces to derive the features. This keeps the determination
    of isolated features in a part straightforward. However, interaction
    of features creates difficulties since the adjacency information between
    some faces is lost. We derive this lost information by considering faces
    that when extended intersect other faces to form concave edges. The derived
    face adjacencies are termed virtual links. Augmenting the virtual links
    to the cavity graph of the object leads to its feature graph, and subgraph
    matching of primitive graphs in this graph results in feature hypotheses.
    A feature hypothesis is considered valid if the volume corresponding
    to it is not shared with the part in question; therefore, we verify the
    feature hypotheses by checking the regularized intersection of the feature
    volume and the part. Thus, feature verification employs a constructive
    solid geometry approach. We have implemented a prototype of the system

    objective of this research is to study the transformations of these attributes
