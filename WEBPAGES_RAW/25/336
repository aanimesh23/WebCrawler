<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Course goals:</B>  This course is the first
of a three-quarter sequence introducing the field of informatics&mdash;computer
science with an emphasis on software and systems design and the human, organizational,
and social context surrounding what we design.  This course will not only
broaden your technical horizons but also focus on systematic problem solving.
 We welcome you and we hope you enjoy it.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Prerequisite concepts:</B>  This course
does not expect any previous experience in computer science or computer
programming.  If you do have some experience, you will find some topics
familiar but many others will certainly be new to you.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">We do expect each student to be able to navigate
the Windows  systems in our labs, to navigate the World-Wide Web, to download
and read documents in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) format, and to read and send electronic
mail.  Some of our assignments will require these skills.  If you need to
pick these skills up or sharpen them, do it in the first week of the quarter;
speak with us if you need a hand.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Meeting place and times:  </B>Lecture meets
six hours each week:  Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11:00 to 12:20 
and also from 2:00 to 3:30 in Steinhaus Hall 174. Each student must enroll in one of these lab sections:<br />
1. Monday/Wednesday/Friday from 1:00 to 2:50 p.m. in ICS 189<br />
2. Monday/Wednesday/Friday from 3:00 to 4:50 p.m. in ICS 189</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">None of these hours are optional. Most of your lab work will be done in pairs,
  so the scheduled lab times are the best times to
  work with your partner.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Office hours:  </B>You are welcome to drop by my office at any time.  If I'm there and not immersed in something
else, I'll be glad to chat about the course material or other topics.
 I will definitely be in or near my office during these scheduled hours,
during which course-related matters will have first priority:  Tuesdays from 3:20 (right after class) to 3:45 and Fridays from 12:15 to 12:45. I may adjust these times at the end of the first week. Of course emergencies
may come up, but I will try to give advance notice of any change. I'll
also be happy to make arrangements for other times during the week; &quot;making an appointment&quot; is no big deal (but if you make one, don't skip it  without getting in touch).  The
quickest and most effective way to reach me is by electronic mail, as described
below.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Questions and announcements:</B>  You can
usually get a response to your course-related questions within a few hours
(a bit less frequently on the weekends) by sending electronic mail to the
ID </FONT><A HREF="mailto:i41@uci.edu"><code>i41@uci.edu</code></A><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">.
 This goes to all of us, and whoever reads it first can respond.  If you
need to reach one of us individually, use our individual IDs listed above. I will never intentionally ignore a message, so if you don't receive a response, write again; sometimes overactive spam filters snag a legitmate message. Using course-specific subject lines and your UCInet Email address will help your messages get noticed.</FONT></P>
<P>
  <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">We may also send course announcements by Email
    to the official course mailing list, so you should check your Email daily.
    Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar
    has for you (your UCInet ID).    If you prefer to read your Email
  on another account, forwarding instructions appear below.</FONT><font face="Goudy Old Style"> Don&#39;t let this slide; if you miss official
announcements, your grade could suffer.</font></P>

The complete text may be downloaded for free from that web site, though it would be nice to pay the author the $5.00 he requests.

<P><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/"><em>How to Design Programs,</em> second edition</a> by Felleisen, Flatt, Findler, and Krishnamurthi.

It, too, is fully and freely available on line.</FONT></P>

<P><em><font face="Goudy Old Style">Fluency with Information Technology, Second Edition,</font></em><font face="Goudy Old Style"> by Lawrence Snyder. This text covers the non-programming content of the course. We won't use it for specific assignments, so we've designated it as optional, but some students have found it useful in the past.

is a list of supplementary references on course topics.  These are not required
reading (unless we tell you otherwise later).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Labs and lab hours:</B> Of course you will
need to do some of your work outside of the scheduled Monday/Wednesday/Friday
lab hours.  Students in Informatics 41 may use any of the school&#39;s instructional
computing labs except for times when another course is scheduled in the
lab exclusively.  See </FONT><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab</code></A><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">
for lab hours and other information.   Note in particular that all ICS labs
are closed on university holidays, such as the Friday after Thanksgiving
(but not the Saturday and Sunday).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Please remember that programming tasks always
take longer to complete than you think they will, no matter how much experience
you have.  You must account for this as you plan your time; we cannot accept
busy schedules or time mismanagement as an excuse for late or incomplete
assignments.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Course structure:
<BR />
</B><I><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/index.html">Weekly homework assignments and lab assignments</A></I> (25% of the course grade). All the assignments
will be available at </FONT><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/</code></A><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">.
<BR />
<I>Class participation:</I>  Based primarily on participating consistently
and effectively in the lab, including turning in a partner evaluation for each lab assignment (10%).
<BR />
<I>Weekly quizzes:  </I>Given in lecture every Tuesday morning at 11:00
(30% together).   The previous years' quizzes are available on the web at </FONT><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/quiz/old"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/quiz/old</code></A><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">;
they&#39;re an excellent way to prepare and review (but they won&#39;t perfectly
mirror the form and content of this year&#39;s quizzes). Because there's a quiz every week, there is no way to make up missed quizzes; however, quizzes missed for good reasons won't count negatively in anyone's grade.<BR />
<I>One final exam:</I>  On Tuesday, December 6, from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. (35%).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">We determine final grades neither on a formal
curve (with equal numbers of As and Fs, Bs and Ds, and so on) nor on a fixed,
straight scale.  Scores on the scale shown below will get the grades indicated,
but in the past the actual cutoffs have often been lower; this means that
you should not assume your grade will be as low as the scale indicates.
 If you&#39;re concerned, check with your TA or the instructor.  The basic
scale is:  grades in the A range (A-, A, and in exceptional cases, A+),
90% and above; grades in the B range, 80%&ndash;90%; grades in the C range, 70%&ndash;80%. We urge everyone to focus not on letter grades but on learning what's necessary to earn high scores; the grades will follow from that.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Your TA has primary responsibility for evaluating
your work; see the TA first for any questions about grading or scoring. 
If that does not resolve your question, then see the instructor.  Quiz and lab scores will be recorded on the web at eee.uci.edu. We will be happy to correct any errors that do occur, but we
must ask that you bring us your grading questions within a week after the
item is returned; the course moves quickly and we simply can&#39;t deal
with assignments long past.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">We&#39;re required to say that in unusual circumstances,
these criteria could change, but we do not expect that to happen.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Special needs:</B> Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation due to a disability should contact the UCI Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to explore the possible range of accommodations. We encourage all students having difficulty, whether or not due to a disability, to consult privately with the instructor at any time. </FONT></P>

</p><P> <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>Good advice and helpful hints:</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Make
  every effort to attend each class meeting; we will often cover material that isn&#39;t
  directly in the textbook.  It&#39;s not fair to ask the TA simply to repeat
  lecture material you missed, though of course the TA will always answer questions about
  it.</FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Attend your lab section, too;
  assignments will be checked off there, you will do most of your lab work there, and you can get a different perspective there than you hear in lecture.
  Don&#39;t hesitate to ask your TA to address topics  that will help you. 
  Since most of your work will be done with a partner, your partner also depends
  on your consistent presence.</FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Check your electronic mail regularly; this
  is an official channel for course announcements.</FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Keep up with the reading; you&#39;ll need it
  to do your assignments, and the quarter system goes so fast that a few missed
  pages can quickly become a few chapters if you&#39;re not careful.  You
  will want to read the assigned sections early so you can ask us about parts
  that aren&#39;t clear. </FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">The assignments, like all technical specifications,
  require careful and thorough reading and re-reading.  Expect to refer back
  to the assignment often, and check it first when you have questions about
  what&#39;s required or how to proceed.  Before you come to lab, be sure
  to read the assignment to get an idea of what&#39;s required.</FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Start each assignment early.  Assignments will
  be due weekly, but you&#39;ll need to spend some time on them nearly every
  day.  Programming always takes longer to complete than you think it will,
  even if you have previous programming experience.  By starting early, you&#39;ll
  have time to ask in discussion section about problems you encounter.</FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">If you find yourself having trouble or getting
  behind, speak with your TA or the instructors.  We have lots of ways to help.
  But <I>never</I> take the shortcut of copying someone else&#39;s work and
  turning it in; the consequences can be far worse than just a low score on
  a lab assignment.  ICS takes academic honesty very seriously; for a more
  complete discussion, see our course collaboration guidelines (<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/honesty.html"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/honesty.html</code></a>) and the ICS departmental web page covering academic
honesty issues (</FONT><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php/index.php#cheating"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php/index.php#cheating</code></A><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">).</FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Turn in whatever portion of an assignment you
  have completed on the due date.  It&#39;s much better to turn in something
  rather than nothing; zeroes are hard to make up.  In some circumstances
  you may arrange with your TA to work further on an assignment after the
  due date, but you must turn in whatever you have when the official due date
  comes.  Likewise, don&#39;t skip any quizzes if you can help it; too many zeroes will significantly lower your overall score.</FONT></P>
<P> <FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style">Always keep your own copy of each assignment,
  both electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the
  shuffle (or if a file server in the lab should crash, which has happened),
  we&#39;ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily. </FONT></P>
