<H3> Research Abstract</H3>
<br>
Our vision is focused on utilizing the intrinsic properties of vehicular 
traffic, coupled with modern communication, computing and 
information management technologies, in order to facilitate increased 
safety and situational awareness on high-speed highways. We anticipate 
an environment where traveling vehicles communicate among themselves, 
forming rapidly changing ad hoc network topologies.
Several cars travel on a highway while communicating locally via an 
ad hoc wireless network
Each car is equipped with a laptop or PDA equipped with a wireless LAN card
(e.g., 802.11) for local communication
and forms, around itself, a local area of communication. 
Cars that are further away, although they may constitute part of a neighbor's 
local area, are not part of that particular car's communication network. 
All cars broadcast information omni-directionally and receive data from any 
and every direction. There is no point-to-point communication link. 
The purpose of the ad hoc network is to impart information, i.e., the car's 
vital signs, to vehicles in close proximity and to receive the same data 
from them. The information is processed locally to provide the driver 
with a map indicating the status of each car in the 
immediate vicinity, e.g., acceleration, turning signal status, braking, etc.
<br>
<br>
We are faced with a very dynamic environment composed of fast-moving vehicles, 
which, from the communication perspective, translates into rapidly changing 
network topologies. In addition, the data that is exchanged between the 
vehicles is time sensitive. 
Since the communication devices are mounted in vehicles, power supply is 
practically unlimited thus making it possible to use fairly large antennas 
and on-board GPS devices. Also, the data is really of interest only to a 
small circle of neighboring vehicles.

Although the problem is simplified by the single-hop nature of the network 
and the consequent lack of routing, it also raises some concerns, 
primarily, the throughput of the system and the delays involved. 
Since data is time-sensitive, and in many cases, urgent in nature 
(e.g., speeding vehicle approaching in left lane), the system must be 
robust and capable to support the traffic load and its time critical needs. 
Tradeoffs to be investigated involve the type of data, its urgency and the 
practical limits of the system before it degenerates into chaos and data 
flow comes to a halt. More complex, multi-channel systems capable of coping 
with the traffic load and its delay constraints, pose a different set of 
problems associated with the speed with which vehicles can associate 
themselves to the different channels and maintain an up-to-date 
picture of their surroundings.
