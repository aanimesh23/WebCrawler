<H2>Downloading the Jimage Client</H2>

<p>&nbsp; 
Chimera client applications have been modified to provide the user with
ability to utilize hypermedia functions.  These include the ability to
make anchors on portions of documents, connect such anchors to links, and
to traverse links.  The Jimage client application provides such capabilities
in the form of an application that displays gif and jpeg images.
</p>

<p> Jimage will function as an application that displays images even if
you don't have Chimera on your system.  In that case, you will not have the
ability to use the hypermedia functions Chimera provides.
</p>

<H3>Things to have in place for Jimage</H3>

<p> Jimage is written in Java and it requires that you have the following
in place on your system.  
</p>

<ul>
    <li> A Java Interpretor compatible with JDK 1.1.5
	
    <li> Swing 0.7 (This is used to display Jimage and 
	should be in your CLASSPATH variable.)

</ul>

<p> (See 
<A HREF="preparing_system.html">Preparing your System for Chimera
</A> for an example of setting swing for your system.)
</p>

<H3>Downloading Jimage</H3>

<p>
You may download Jimage from the following site:
<br> <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/chimera/software/index.html">
Chimera 2.0 Download page </A>
<br> 
Jimage should be listed on the page.
</p>

<p>Place Jimage anywhere you wish on your system.  A good spot is 
a directory which you use to hold your Java programs.
</p>

<H3>Preparing to run Jimage on your system</H3>

<p> Once you have downloaded Jimage, you need to add it to the 
your CLASSPATH.  CLASSPATH is the environment variable used by the 
Java interpretor to look for Java byte-code.
</p>

<p> To see how to add Jimage to the CLASSPATH follow the appropriate link
below:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><A HREF="jimage_classpath_setup_unix.html">
        Setting CLASSPATH in Unix to include jimage
        </A>&nbsp;</li>

    <li><A HREF="jimage_classpath_setup_nt.html">
        Setting CLASSPATH in Windows NT to include jimage
        </A>&nbsp;</li>

</ul>

<p> You now have the Jimage application downloaded and properly set to 
be run.
