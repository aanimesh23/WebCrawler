<td width ="80%">
You will submit programming assignments and other work electronically, via a
  special system called <b>Checkmate</b>.
This same system also allows you to check the status of your programming
   assignment submissions.
But, it does not allow you download work that you submitted, so make sure to
  archive a copy of all the work that you submit.
<p>
To use Checkmate, you must first activate your <b>UCInetID</b>.
If you have not already done so,
  <a href=" http://activate.uci.edu/">activate</a> it now.
<p>
Once you have an activated UCInetID, you need to 
  <a href="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu">Login to Checkmate </a>
  and enroll yourself in my appropriate course (you do this only once,
  at the start of the quarter).
The rest of this handout shows you how.

<h3>This handout was last updated in Spring 2013, showing a student setting
    up checkmate for ICS-31.
    Generally, Checkmate is a stable system that doesn't change much.
    When you follow these instructions, make sure that you specify the correct
    <b>quarter</b> and <b>course</b>.
</h3>

  You will first see the UCInetID verification page

Enter your <b>UCInetID</b> and <b>Password</b> on this page.
You will next see the following page, which includes your
  Name (UCInetID): here it shows my name as <b>Peter Anteater</b>
  and my UCInetID as <b>(=31Test)</b>; I had to create this bogus
  information because I am not a student at UCI.

Ensure that <b>Choose Quarter</b> is the correct quarter (change it with the
  pulldown menu and click the <b>Go</b> button if necessary).
Now you should click on the <b>Course Listing</b> link to enroll yourself
  in ICS-31 (or whatever course you are in).
You will next see a page similar to the following one (except that it
  will likely have more courses and instructors using checkmate this quarter).

Find the correct <b>Course</b> and <b>Instructor(s)</b> entry.
Note that (a) sometimes your instructor will teach more than one course during
  a quarter and(b) sometimes more than one instructor will teach a course with
  the same number; so examine this information careful.
Once you have located your course, click the <b>Go</b> button to the left of 
  it.
One of my courses is listed for the Spring 2013 as <b>36540: I&C SCI 31</b>)
  followed by my name.
You will next see a confirmation page similar to the following one.

Assuming that you are enrolling in a course for the first time, Checkmate will
  show you as "not yet listed" for this course.
Click the <b>List me for this course</b> button.
You will then be directed to the <b>Assignments</b> page similar to the
  following one.

This page shows only <b>Assignment #0</b> visible; generally each assignment
  becomes visible starting on the day that I officially assign it.
It shows <b>Nothing submitted</b> in a gray background, meaning that you have
  not yet submitted any parts of this assignment (there are two).
Note that we will start working on this assignment during our second lab.
<p>
Let's now examine how to see the details of this assignment and submit one
  part of it (the other part is submitted similarly).
Click the <b>Details/Submit</b> button under <b>Assignment #0</b> and you
  will see a page similar to the following one.

So, this assignment (<b>#0</b>) has two parts
    (<b>1</b> and <b>2</b>): each allows 
    <b>Exactly 1</b> file (see <b>Quantity</b>) to be submitted;
    for part <b>1</b>it must be a file named <b>demo.py</b>; and
    for part <b>2</b>it must be a file named <b>collatzy.py</b>
    (see <b>Allowable file names(s):</b>).
<p>
Each part is first described by some text.
Each part also has a <b>Choose File</b> button that you can use to find the
  file that you want to submit, and a <b>Submit File(s)</b> button
  to do that submission.
If you click <b>Choose File</b> and then double-click the <b>wrong</b> named
  file (as illustrated below)
<p>

at which time you can click the <b>Return to Assignment Details</b> button
  to try again.
If you click <b>Choose File</b> and then double-click the <b>correct</b> 
  named file, you will see a page with the following confirmation message
  (as illustrated below).

For this <b>Assignment</b>, <b>Requirements are not yet met</b> in a red
  background,appears because only one of the two required parts of this
  programming assignment have been submitted.
For <b>Part #1</b>, the <b>Choose File</b> and <b>Submit File(s)</b> buttons
  have been replaced with information about the file already submitted and
  a <b>Remove File</b> button, in case you want to remove the current submission
  and resubmit a version of this file: if you remove the current file, the
  <b>Choose File</b> and <b>Submit File(s)</b> buttons will reappear.
You may remove/submit files as many times as you want.
Although Checkmate saves all your submissions (and  we can see all of them),
  we grade only the final submission that you make.
<p>
After submitting both files, Checkmate will display the page for this
  assignment as follows.

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>&nbsp</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
<p>
The text <b>Requirements are met</b> in a green background, appears because all
  parts for this assignment have now been successfully submitted.
Of course, this says nothing about the quality or correctness of the
  submission; it pertains only to the requirement that all needed files, with
   the correct names, were submitted.
Again, by using the <b>Remove File</b> buttons you can remove files that you
  submitted early, so that your resubmit any/all parts.
These files are never really removed from the dropoff system, but instead are
  put in a special "old submission" area that Checkmate maintains.
Finally, if you return to the <b>Course Page</b>, which shows summary
  information about each assignment, you will see a page similar to the
  following one.

This completes our tour of the Checkmate system.
You can practice with this system by yourself; we will start using it for real
  during our first lab meeting.
