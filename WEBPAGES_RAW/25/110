<h1>
Asynchronous adaptive task allocation
</h1>
<h2>
Sotirios Kentros
</h2>

<p>
We present a randomized algorithm for asynchronous task allocation, also
known as the write-all or do-all problem. Our algorithm has work
complexity
of <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>k</i><sup>2</sup>log<sup>3</sup><i>k</i>)
with high probability, where <i>n</i> is the number of tasks
and <i>k</i> is the number of processes that participate in the
computation. This is the first adaptive solution for the write-all
problem that has work <i>n</i> plus some additive term which depends
only on the number of participating processes&nbsp;<i>k</i> and not the
size of the problem&nbsp;<i>n</i>.
