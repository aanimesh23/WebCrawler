<h3>Pair Programming Partner Evaluation</h3>
</div>

<p>Now that it is time to switch partners, we want you to evaluate your experience with your current partner by completing the Pair Partner Evaluation Form, below. The evaluation is due at the date and time given in the Course Schedule.</p>
<div class="section">

<h4>Evaluation Questions</h4>
</div>

To evaluate your partner,

<ul>
<li><p>Copy the form into the <i>body</i> of an email; do not make it as an attachment.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete the evaluation. You can indicate your choice from various options by deleting all the options for the question except the one you want to pick. Answer the open-ended questions by simply typing in your repsonses.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the subject of the email "First Partner Evaluation"</p></li>
<li><p>Email the completed evaluation to <font class = "codefacesmall">21-questions@ics.uci.edu</font></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Although the open response questions are phrased to elicit a yes or no response, you are encouraged to include comments to elaborate on your answer; the goal is to paint us a picture of the nature of your partner&#146;s participation in paired work, and what you think about pair programming (so far). </p>

<p>If you were given approval to work alone instead of in a pair, complete this evaluation about yourself as best as you can, revising it as necessary to make sense in that context. For example, the first question could be interpreted as &#147;Did you come to lab on time and ready to work?&#148;</p>
<br><br>
<center><b>Pair Partner Evaluation Form</b></center>
<p>My Name:</p>

<p>My UCI ID Number:</p>

<p>My Partner's Name:</p>

<p>My partner's technical competency is (choose one):</p>

<p><b>Open response questions</b></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Did your partner come to the scheduled meetings on time and ready to work? Did you partner notify you if she or he would not be able to attend a meeting or fulfill a responsibility?</p></li>

<li><p>Did your partner read the assignment and preparatory materials before coming to the scheduled meetings, showing up either with specific questions or ready to contribute?</p></li>

<li><p>Did your partner cooperatively follow the pair programming model (rotating roles of driver and navigator, questioning and making observations as the navigator)?</p></li>

<li><p>Did your partner contribute fully, fairly, and actively, to the best of his or her ability, to the completion of the lab assignment?</p></li>

<li><p>Was your partner's participation professional and cooperative overall?</p></li>

<li><p>Have you found pair programming helpful in completing the programming work and learning about programming in general? If you have previous experience programming alone, do you now prefer working in pairs?</p></li>

<h3>Choosing your Next Partner</h3>
</div>
<p>For the next two assignments, you will work with a <i>new</i> partner. Your new partner cannot be your current partner, unless you took on a new partner after Lab Exam 2 was given; in that case, you and your current partner can remain partners for Labs 4 and 5, if you both agree.</p>

<p> As before, we prefer you and your partner chose each other, asking for a TA&#146;s assistance if you cannot find a partner. Report the new partnership via email to <font class = "codefacesmall">21-questions@ics.uci.edu</font> no later than the date given in the Course Schedule. </p>

<h4>Why the Switch</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Learning to work with different individuals is an important skill in general, and in the computer science workplace in particular; virtually all projects are accomplished by teams where membership changes ocassionally (and sometimes often).</p></li>

<li><p>Sometimes one of a pair will drop the course, or stop participating in it, leaving the other person of the pair without a partner. Reforming pairs lets us correct that situation.</p></li>

<li><p>Switching gives you an opportunity to pair up with another who has passed (and not passed) the same, or close to the same, lab exams; we strongly recommend you take advantage of this opportunity.  Such a pairing puts together students who have (close to) the same tasks to complete, maximizing the benefit to both partners. 
</ul>
