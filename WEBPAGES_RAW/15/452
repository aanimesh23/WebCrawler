<p> Robert Olson
</p>
</div>
<p>While growing up, Robert Olson viewed playing with a computer as equivalent to playing with any other toy. </p>
<p>&#8220;The foundation for my passion for computers came from being exposed to video games, computers, and the Internet from a young age.&#8221; Olson, a sophomore in information and computer sciences, said.</p>
<p>But his inspiration to pursue computer science as a career came from a person he never event meet. </p>
<p>During 8th grade, Olson played a text-based multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) called Alien Adoption Agency. He really got into the game which offered players the ability to design a personalized skin in HTML. </p>
<p>&#8220;The guy who created the game went by the alias of Webby and I thought this guy was just incredible to have made this game that I loved so much and I told myself that I wanted to be like him,&#8221; Olson recalled. </p>
<p>After discovering the game had been programmed in Perl, Olson, a Bakersfield native, began his journey into the world of computer programming and found it really interesting. </p>
<p>&#8220;I would say more than any single other person, Webby, who I have never even talked to, influenced me to pursue computer science,&#8221; Olson said. </p>
<div class="img_caption_left">

</p>
</div>
<p>Due in part to his gaming experiences, Olson had his heart set on attending the Digipen Institute of Technology in Washington state, a specialized school that offers degree programs related to the field of digital interactive entertainment technology.</p>
<p>However Olson&#8217;s parents convinced him that it was not a good idea to get such a specialized education and he began checking out schools in California that had quality computer science programs. </p>
<p>Olson didn&#8217;t consider himself &#8220;UC quality&#8221; as he had not finished in the top of his graduating high school class and he turned in his application to UCI on the last day, figuring he would soon get a rejection letter. </p>
<p>&#8220;Luckily the effort was worth it because I got in,&#8221; Olson said. &#8220;A lot of people come to UCI saying that this was just their fall back school but for me it really was where I wanted to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Olson chose the information and computer sciences degree because of the programming projects which allow students to see how the skills they are learning are useful in the real world. </p>
<p>&#8220;I don't think a lot of majors experience this because while they are learning a lot of information they don't really see how they can use it,&#8221; Olson said. </p>
<p><strong>FUELED BY HITEC OCTANE </strong></p>
<p>During his freshmen year, it was Olson&#8217;s experience during the Bren School&#8217;s <a href="../../events/extreme/index.php">hITEC OCTANe product development competition</a> that ignited his passion for entrepreneurship. </p>
<p>The competition is designed to foster a spirit of entrepreneurship among Bren School and UC Irvine students, and fuel the development of new technologies that have the potential to positively impact the marketplace.</p>

</div>
<p>Teaming with fellow freshmen Abhishek Amit, whom he meet in his first ICS class, the pair worked with their mentor, Bren School alumnus Gregory Moulton to come up with a workable product. </p>
<p>&#8220;Our mentor was a lot of help because he made us think about the business side of the competition when Abhishek and I just wanted to focus on the technical side,&#8221; Olson said. </p>
<p>The dynamic duo ended up winning the top prize of $5,000 for their Web-based integrated development environment used to write and compile source code in different languages from within a Web browser.</p>
<p>It was a seminal moment for Olson. </p>
<p>&#8220;Abhishek and I knew it was a long shot for us the win the competition, but we decided to try it and as a result we won some nice prize money. Money we never would have won if we didn't try,&#8221; Olson said. &#8220;We knew we would be going up against teams that were older and smarter than us and that inspired us to work even harder on it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>TAKING ADVANTAGE </strong></p>
<p>Even though he is only a sophomore, Olson has taken advantage of a number of internship and research opportunities the Bren School offers to its undergraduates. </p>
<p>During the summer Olson worked as a Java programmer for The Tech Factory, a small company in Irvine. </p>
<p>&#8220;This was my first time working on a truly large software application with tens of thousands lines of code and hundreds of files and to be honest I was scared at first by the scope of it,&#8221; Olson said. &#8220;However, by the third week I'd picked up the gist of what everything did and was making meaningful contributions to the code base.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the fall of 2006 he did research for Project RESCUE in collaboration with Motorola. </p>
<p>&#8220;It was the first time I'd done programming for a cell phone so that was cool,&#8221; Olson said. &#8220;I decided that I enjoy the research "environment" and now I am considering graduate school as a possibility after I graduate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite his hectic schedule, Olson finds time to kick back and relax with his roommates at their ocean view apartment in Newport Beach. </p>
<p>&#8220;Never in my life did I think I would be living on the beach but thanks to the cumulative rent of eight people it has become a reality,&#8221; Olson said. &#8220;I know that later in my life I'll look back at my time in Newport with fond memories.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also takes advantage of the many classes offered at the Anteater Recreation Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;This quarter I'm taking scuba diving which is something I've always wanted to try and next quarter I'm looking forward to trying rock climbing and sailing,&#8221; Olson said. &#8220;It is a really cheap and laid-back environment to learn a new activity in.&#8221;</p>
<p>His many experiences in only his first two years at UC Irvine have shown Olson that the old clich&#233; of try everything is true. </p>
<p>&#8220;You don't realize how many things you miss out on just because you never try it,&#8221; Olson said. </p>
