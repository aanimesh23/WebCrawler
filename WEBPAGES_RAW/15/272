Foundations for Graph Watermarking
</h1>
<h2>

<p>
Abstract:
We introduce security and algorithmic foundations for graph
watermarking. Our foundations are based on characterizing the
feasibility of graph watermarking in terms of keygen, marking, and
identification functions defined over graph families with known
distributions. We demonstrate the strength of this approach with
exemplary watermarking schemes for two random graph models, both of
which are used to model real-world networks. In addition, unlike
previous marking/de-anonymization schemes based on adding new
vertices, our framework supports effective graph watermarking schemes
that use only edge flipping.
