						<h1>Boeing Bold Stroke Avionics Example</h1>
						
							<p>This section illustrates the use of the Alderis language in a case study from the domain of avionics distributed real-time embedded (DRE) systems. Figure 1 shows the component-based architecture of the system, which is built upon the Boeing Bold Stroke real-time middleware. This application is deployed on a non-preemptive multiprocessor platform. As shown in Figure 1, this application is driven by five <i>Timer</i> components deployed on five CPUs.</p>

								<h2>Figure 1 - Aspects of the Bold Stroke Application</h2>

							</p>

							<p>
Computations on different processors are driven by their respective
timers. Components, however, do not necessarily execute with the
timer's rate, as seen in the <i>NAV_DISPLAY</i> component's case. It
is executed more often to serve remote requests than to serve local
requests on <i>CPU_3</i>.

							<h2>Compositional Analysis</h2>

							<p>
Figure 3 shows how we modeled the system in the <i>Uppaal</i> model checker tool. The application consits of 11 Task
components and 11 event channels, which 5 are local and used only for
buffering. The application is deployed on 5 processors. We have to model event channels explicitly (1)
when we have to buffer events or (2) on remote event channels which
have measureable delays. All the event channels satisfy one of the
above conditions, except the timer's event channels that have been
abstracted out in the model.
							</p>

							<p>
The scheduling policies are represented by <i>Schedulers</i> in the
<i>DRE Semantic Domain</i>. Since the Bold Stroke application is
deployed on a 5-processor architecture we define 5 schedulers as shown
on Figure 3. The schedulers get more complex
according to the scheduling policies. The automatic generation of the
models provides a safe way to ensure the correct guard conditions and
assignments. The timed automata model shown in Figure 3 corresponding 
to the Bold Stroke system shown in Figure 1 has been shown 
to be schedulable.
