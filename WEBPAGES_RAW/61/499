Progress in Applying Computational Methods to Huntington's Disease
Research<br>
Malcolm S. Casale, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

<p>In recent weeks, researchers from several distinct departments
in the University of California, Irvine, have been applying various
computational methods to determine an optimal research protocol for
Huntington's disease. The departments include computer science,
chemistry and the college of medicine plus others that have played
advisory and consulting roles. An overview of this work will be
given, and the talk will then concentrate on two aspects of the
research: (1) development of a computational model of huntingtin
(the HD protein) aggregation, and (2) an "on-line" algorithm for
finding commercially available compounds as experimental controls
and potential therapeutic agents. Time permitting, a novel and
speculative approach to the geometric sampling problem (which may,
or may not, be relevant to the title topic) will be presented.</p>
