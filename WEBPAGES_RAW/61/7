<P> <FONT SIZE=6><B>Eighth Homework</B></FONT></P>
<P>Get your work checked and signed off by a classmate, then show it to your TA in lab on Monday, March 5.</P>
<P><B>(a) </B> Finish up the problems from last week's homework, in particular:</P>
<ul>
<li>Read the problem description for the amusement park simulator.
</li>
<li>Watch the <i>Sorting Out Sorting</i> video
</li>
<li>Complete the modification of your Stats program.  Everyone in this course is expected to achieve a baseline of coding proficiency in Python; even if you're not headed for software development as a career, you'll need to write some code in your subsequent classes.</li>
</ul>
<P><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><B>(b)</B></FONT> Some <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i42/w12.fxrq.html">review questions for the final</a> are on line. They're not required as part of this homework, but it would be a good idea if you were able to do these problems. (Some of the code hasn't been translated into Python, but for this purpose it should be easy enough to follow.) <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i42/w12.fxrqans.html">Answers</a> are also available, but actually try to do the problems before looking.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Goudy Old Style"><b><strong>(c)</strong></b>  Beyond that, spend your time working
  on the lab assignment.</FONT></P>
