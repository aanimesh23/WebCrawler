Title: Computing Planar Voronoi Diagrams in Double Precision: A Further Example of Degree-driven Algorithm Design </h2>
<h2>
Authors: David L. Millman, Jack Snoeyink 
</h2>

<p>
Abstract: Geometric algorithms use numerical computations to perform 
geometric tests, so correct algorithms may produce erroneous results 
if insufficient arithmetic precision is available. Liotta, Preparata, 
and Tamassia, in 1999, suggested that algorithm design, which traditionally 
considers running time and memory space, could also consider precision 
as a resource. They demonstrated that the Voronoi diagram of n sites on 
a U x U grid could be rounded to answer nearest neighbor queries on 
the same grid using only double precision. They still had to compute 
the Voronoi diagram before rounding, which requires the quadruple-precision 
InCircle test. We develop a 
"degree-2 Voronoi diagram" that can be computed using only double 
precision by a randomized incremental construction in O(n log n log U) 
expected time and O(n) expected space. Our diagram also answers nearest 
neighbor queries, even though 
it doesn't even use sufficient precision to determine a 
Delaunay triangulation.
