<H2> Abstract </H2>

Despite the importance of describing and analyzing the relationships among a
software system's components, most languages and development environments do
not provide suitable support for these activities. While Ada and the various
existing Ada environments offer some assistance, the capabilities they offer
are inadequate for use in truly large and complex software development
projects. To address these shortcomings, we are developing the AdaPIC toolset,
which we envision as an important component of an Ada software development
environment. The AdaPIC toolset is one particular instantiation, specifically
adapted for use with Ada, of the more general collection of language features
and analysis capabilities that constitute the PIC approach to describing and
analyzing relationships among software system components. This toolset is
being tailored to support an incremental approach to the interface control
aspects of the software development process. Following a discussion of the
interface control and incremental development concepts, this paper describes
the AdaPIC toolset, concentrating on its analysis tools and support for
incremental development and demonstrating how it contributes to the technology
for developing large Ada software systems.
