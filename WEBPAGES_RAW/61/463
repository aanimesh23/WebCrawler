This talk and journal paper combines the results from
"<a href="p-lombardi-subcubic.html">Planar Lombardi drawings for
subcubic graphs</a>" and "<a href="p-planar-soap.html">The graphs of
planar soap bubbles</a>".
It uses three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to define a partition of
the plane into cells with circular-arc boundaries, given an input
consisting of (possibly
overlapping) circular disks and disk complements, which remains
invariant under M&ouml;bius transformations of the input. We use this
construction as a tool to construct planar Lombardi drawings of
all 3-regular planar graphs; these are graph drawings in which the edges
are represented by circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex.
We also use it to characterize the graphs of two-dimensional soap bubble
clusters as being exactly the 2-vertex-connected 3-regular planar graphs.
