<h1>Graph algorithms</h1>

<a name="graph">What is a graph?</a> 

<p>It's an abstract notion, used to represent the idea of some kind
of connection between pairs of objects. A graph consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>A collection of "vertices", which I'll usually draw as small
circles on the blackboard, and</li>

<li>A collection of "edges", each connecting some two vertices.
I'll usually draw these as curves on the blackboard connecting the
given pair of vertices.</li>
</ul>

For this definition it doesn't matter what the vertices or edges
represent -- that will be different depending on what application
the graph comes from. It also doesn't matter how I draw the graph,
the only part that matters is which pairs of vertices are connected
with each other. 

<p> There are two different types of graph that we'll commonly
see.</p>

<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="ug"></a></li>

<li>In one type, known as an <i>undirected graph</i> it doesn't
matter which end of the graph is which -- the relation between the
two is symmetric. In that case I'll just draw the edges as an
undecorated curve. 

<p>For instance, suppose we draw a graph with one vertex for every
person in the U.S., and one edge connecting any two people who have
shaken hands with each other. If I've shaken hands with you, you've
shaken hands with me, so each edge is symmetric. It seems to be
true that graphs like this have very small {\em diameter}: you can
connect any two people with a very short chain of handshakes.</p>

<p><a name="dg"></a></p>
</li>

<li>In the other type of graph, known as a <i>directed graph</i>,
an edge goes from one of the vertices, towards the other. In this
case I'll draw an arrowhead at the vertex towards which the edge is
going. If we drew a graph like the handshake graph described above,
but instead connected two people if one had written a letter to the
other, the result would be directed: if I've written a letter to
you, you may not have written a letter back to me.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever we talk about graphs, we'll use <i>n</i> to denote the
number of vertices, and <i>m</i> to denote the number of edges.
This notation is confusing, but I'll stick with it because it's
very standard. We'll also use V(G) to denote the set of vertices of
a graph G, and E(G) to denote the set of edges.</p>

<h2>Some more examples of graphs</h2>

<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="acyc"></a></li>

<li>Any tree is a graph. In fact trees can be defined as the
undirected graphs that are connected (there is a path between any
two vertices) and acyclic (there aren't any sequences of edges that
go around in a loop). (It is also possible to define trees in terms
of directed graphs.) Any connected graph has at least <i>n</i>-1
edges, and any acyclic graph has at most <i>n</i>-1 edges, so any
tree has exactly <i>n</i>-1 edges. 

<p><a name="compgraph"></a></p>
</li>

<li>In the last lecture, we saw a notation for decision trees in
which I connected two circles (representing objects to be sorted)
by a downward edge if a comparison had been done and had found that
one was greater than the other. This is an example of a directed
graph. 

<p>The same comparison graph notation is useful in solving homework
3.19, which asked you to find an element among the smallest <i>
k</i> values among an <i>n</i>-value set. A simple method which
uses exactly <i>n</i>-<i>k</i> comparisons is just to find the
minimum of the first <i>n</i>-<i>k</i>+1 values in the list. To
prove this is optimal, suppose we have found some value <i>x</i>
that we know to be in the smallest <i>k</i> values. Therefore, we
must be able to show from the comparisons we have made that at
least <i>n</i>-<i>k</i> other values are larger than it. So if we
draw the comparison graph of the comparisons we've made, <i>x</i>
must be part of a connected region of <i>n</i>-<i>k</i>+1 values
(counting <i>x</i> itself), so this region has to have at least <i>
n</i>-<i>k</i> edges and we must have made that many
comparisons.</p>

<p><a name="famtree"></a></p>
</li>

<li>Our third example of a graph is a "family tree". We draw a
vertex for each member of a family, and a directed edge from each
parent to each child. This is not really a tree [exercise: give two
reasons why not] but in many families has a structure similar to a
tree. Typical graph algorithm problems for this example would be to
determine how two people are related, or to draw this graph as a
nice picture of the family tree. 

<p><a name="air"></a></p>
</li>

<li>We can represent airline schedules as a graph, in which the
vertices correspond to airports, and edges correspond to flights.
Unlike the previous examples, there is some extra information here
that we can attach to the graph; for instance we might store the
time, cost, and airline for each flight. A typical graph algorithm
problem here might be to find the cheapest route from city A to
city B, allowing stops in between. 

<p><a name="vlsi"></a></p>
</li>

<li>A VLSI circuit design consists of a collection of components
(gates or transistors) connected by wires. We can think of the
components as vertices, and the wires as edges. A typical problem
is to translate the list of electrical connections into the design
for a chip. 

<p><a name="pcb"></a></p>
</li>

<li>Another problem in electronics comes from printed circuit board
manufacturing. A PC board is made of fiberglass, with wires
connecting places for chips to be plugged in. One step of making PC
boards involves drilling holes where the chips go, and other holes
connecting wires in different layers of the board. We want to be
able to plan the movement of a drill from one hole to the next, so
it doesn't spend too much time moving. 

<p>We can make a graph, in which the vertices represent holes, and
each two vertices are connected by an edge labeled with the amount
of time it would take to move the drill from one hole to the other.
This is a <i>complete graph</i> since it has every possible edge
that could be there. In this representation, our drill scheduling
problem becomes one of finding the shortest path through this graph
that visits every vertex exactly once. This is a famous problem,
the <i>traveling salesman problem</i>. As we will see much later in
the class, this is an example of an <i>NP-complete problem</i>,
which is evidence that there doesn't exist a good algorithm to
solve it exactly. However you can find a path that's pretty close
to the optimal solution, using <i>minimum spanning trees</i> (to be
explained next week).</p>

<p><a name="reg"></a></p>
</li>

<li>In compiler design, one problem that a compiler must deal with
is, for each variable in your code, to find a machine register that
can store the value of that variable. Typically you can't just
assign them one-to-one because there are likely to be more
variables than registers. But if two variables are used in
different parts of code, it's safe to combine them and store them
both in the same register. We can draw a graph in which variables
correspond to vertices, and an edge shows that two variables exist
at the same time. Then register assignment becomes a <i>graph
coloring</i> problem. Again this is NP-complete but reasonable
heuristics are known for the graphs occurring in this application. 

<p><a name="sched"></a></p>
</li>

<li>Our final example comes from task scheduling -- suppose you are
managing a project consisting of a sequence of several tasks to be
performed (the example I used in class was writing, revising,
handing out and grading a midterm; another comes from compiler
design again: determining what order to perform a sequence of
instructions). Some tasks have to be performed before others, but
it is not always the case that there is one fixed global order that
you have to do everything in. Here we can draw a graph in which a
vertex represents a task, and a directed edge says we have to do
one task before the other. This is pretty similar in some ways to
the comparison graph we drew when analyzing decision trees. One
important graph problem (<i>topological sorting</i> consists of
finding some global ordering consistent with these local
constraints. Another is determining, if you had enough people to
work on as many different tasks as possible at once, how much time
would it take to do the whole job; this is equivalent to finding a
<i>longest path</i> in the graph. We'll see later a longest path
algorithm that uses topological sorting as an important
subroutine.</li>
</ul>

As we have seen, all of these many problems can be reformulated as
graph problems. This hides the unnecessary complications of the
problem, making the important structure more obvious and making it
easier to find a solution. Translation to a graph problem also has
the advantaged that several different real world problems could end
up looking like the same graph problem, so finding a good algorithm
for that one problem could have many applications. 

<h2>Representation of Graphs</h2>

In order to perform graph algorithms in a computer, we have to
decide how to store the graph. When I talk about graphs to you,
I'll draw a diagram with circles and lines on the blackboard, but
computers aren't very good at interpreting that sort of input.
Instead we need a representation closer to the abstract definition
of a graph. There are several possibilities, with different uses. I
didn't go over all of them in the lecture (I left out the incidence
list and incidence matrix.) 

<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="obj"></a></li>

<li><b>Object oriented representation</b>. The most obvious thing
to do is just to copy the definition I gave of a graph. Have some
structure for each vertex (representing whatever information you
want to store there), and another structure for each edge (with
pointers to the two vertices it connects). This representation is a
little difficult to work with, because unless the edges are ordered
more carefully it will be difficult to find the ones you want. 

<p>As an example we might have a graph with four vertices (which
I'll call A, B, C, and D) and four edges: (A,B), (C,D), (B,C),
(C,A). The object oriented representation would just have a list or
array of structures for each of these objects.</p>

<p>The total space used by this representation is just O(m+n),
since there is a constant amount of space (one structure) per
vertex or edge. Most operations in this representation involve
scanning the whole list of edges, and take time O(m).</p>

<p><a name="adjlist"></a></p>
</li>

<li><b>Adjacency list</b> In the adjacency list representation,
each vertex keeps a linked list of the neighboring vertices. The
edges don't really appear at all. In the same graph above, the
lists for each vertex would be: 

<pre>
    A: B, C
    B: A, C
    C: D, B, A
</pre>

This representation makes it much easier to find the edges
connected to any particular vertex. Its space is still also small:
O(m+n), since the total length of all the lists is 2m (each edge
appears twice, once for each of its endpoints). It is also quite
fast for many applications. The slowest operation that might
commonly be used is testing whether a pair of vertices is connected
by an edge; this has to be done by scanning through one of the
lists, but you could speed it up by sorting the adjacency lists and
using binary search. Another disadvantage is that each edge is
listed twice, so if the edges carry any extra information such as a
length it may be complicated to keep track of both copies and make
sure they have the same information. 

<p><a name="inclist"></a></p>
</li>

<li><b>Incidence list</b>. By combining the adjacency list and the
object oriented representation, we get something with the
advantages of both. We just add to the object oriented
representation a list, for each vertex, of pointers to the edges
incident to it. If I don't specify a representation, this is
probably what I have in mind. The space is a little larger than the
previous two representations, but still O(m+n). 

<p><a name="adjmat"></a></p>
</li>

<li><b>Adjacency matrix</b>. In some situations we are willing to
use a somewhat larger data structure so that we can test very
quickly whether an edge exists. We make an n x n matrix M[i,j],
with rows and columns indexed by vertices. If edge (u,v) present,
we put a one in cell M[u,v]; otherwise we leave M[u,v] zero.
Finding the neighbors of a vertex involves scanning a row in O(n)
time, but to test if an edge (u,v) exists just look in that entry,
in constant time. To store extra information like edge lengths, you
can just use more matrices. For the same graph above, we'd have a
matrix 

<pre>
    0 1 1 0
    1 0 1 0
    1 1 0 1
    0 0 1 0
</pre>

This is occasionally useful for performing graph computations by
linear algebra. For instance, if you take the kth power of this
matrix, an entry will be nonzero if and only if the corresponding
vertices are connected by a path of k edges. For undirected graphs,
the matrix will be symmetric. 

<p><a name="incmat"></a></p>
</li>

<li><b>Incidence matrix</b>. This is another matrix, but generally
it is rectangular rather than square (n x m); the rows are indexed
by vertices and the columns by edges. Just like the adjacency
matrix, we put a one in a cell when the corresponding vertex and
edge are incident. Therefore every column will have exactly two
ones in it. For a directed graph, you can make a similar matrix in
which every column has one +1 and one -1 entry. This matrix is
usually not symmetric. For the same graph, the incidence matrix is 

<pre>
    1 0 1 0
    1 1 0 0
    0 1 1 1
    0 0 0 1
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Connectivity</h2>

As a warmup to graph algorithms, we'll start with a simple problem:
is a graph connected? Is there always an airline route from A to B?
Is everyone in the family tree related to everyone else? Can your
scheduling task be split into two parts that can be done by
different departments of your company? 

<p>As a rough outline, we start with some vertex x, and build a
list of the vertices you can get to from x. Each time we find a new
vertex to be added to this list, we check its neighbors to see if
they should be added as well. Finally, we check whether the list
covers the whole graph. In pseudocode:</p>

<pre>
    test-connected(G)
    {
    choose a vertex x
    make a list L of vertices reachable from x,
    and another list K of vertices to be explored.
    initially, L = K = x.

    while K is nonempty
        find and remove some vertex y in K
        for each edge (y,z)
            if (z is not in L)
            add z to both L and K

    if L has fewer than n items
        return disconnected
    else return connected
    }
</pre>

To analyze the algorithm, first notice that the outer loop happens
n times (once per vertex). The time for the inner loop (finding all
unreached neighbors) is more complicated, and depends on the graph
representation. One key step (testing whether z is in L) seems like
it might be slow, but can be done quickly by keeping a bit on each
vertex that says whether it's in L or not. 

<ul>
<li>For the object oriented representation, each execution of the
inner loop involves scanning through all m edges of the graph. So
the total time for the algorithm is O(mn).</li>

<li>For the adjacency matrix representation, each execution of the
inner loop involves looking at a single row of the matrix, in time
O(n). So the total time for the algorithm is O(n^2).</li>

<li>In the adjacency list (or incidence list) representation, each
element on each list is scanned through once. So the total time on
all executions of the inner loop is the same as the total length of
all adjacency lists, which is 2m. Note that we don't multiply this
by n, even though this is a nested loop -- we just add up the
number of times each statement is executed in the overall
algorithm. The total time for the algorithm is O(m+n)</li>
</ul>

At the end of the algorithm, the list L tells you one <i>connected
component</i> of the graph (how much of the graph can be reached
from x). With some more care, we can find all components of G
rather than just one component. 

<p>If graph is connected, we can modify the algorithm to find a
tree in G covering all vertices (a <i>spanning tree</i>): For each
z, let parent(z) be the vertex y corresponding to the time at which
we added z to L. This gives a graph in which each vertex except x
is connected to some previous vertex, and any such graph must be a
tree.</p>

<p>When analyzing the algorithm, we didn't pay attention to what
order we put vertices into K and removed them again, but different
orders produce different trees. If we put vertices at end of K,
take them off front (so K acts like a queue) we get "breadth first
search". Then the parent of z is always as close to x as possible
so this gives shortest paths from x to everything else, and the
tree is short and bushy. If instead we add and remove vertices at
the same end of K (so K acts like a stack) we get "depth first
search". This tends to produce long stringy spanning trees with
some useful properties that we'll see later.</p>
