<H1>Parking Information and Directions to the <br>
UC Irvine McDonnell Douglas Auditorium <br>
including <i>Purchasing a Parking Permit</i></H1>

If this is your first visit to UCI, you should be aware that
it is not easy to figure out the campus. We recommend that you get a 
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~truesdel/campusMaps.html">
map</a> with building numbers.
 
<p>
Parking permits are required at UCI.
<p>

Plan to arrive at least 30 minutes early to ensure you get a parking
space, and to allow time to purchase a permit and to walk to the 
McDonnell Douglas Auditorium.
