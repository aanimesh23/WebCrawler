<h1>Shortest Paths</h1>

The basic problem: Find the "best" way of getting from s to t where
s and t are vertices in a graph. We measure "best" simply as the
sum of edge lengths of a path. For instance the graph could be a
map representing intersections as vertices, road segments as edges;
you want to find either the shortest or fastest route from your
house to ICS. Although both of these problems have different
solutions, they are both shortest path problems; in one the length
of an edge represents the actual mileage of a segment of road,
while in the other it represents the time it would take to drive
it, but in both cases the important fact is that the total length
of a path is measured by adding the lengths of individual edges.
For another example, which I mentioned in my first lecture on graph
algorithms, the graph might have vertices representing airports,
with edges representing possible flights, and the "length" of an
edge measuring the cost of taking that flight; your problem would
then be to find the cheapest flight from e.g. SNA to JFK. Note that
these graphs may be directed; e.g. there may be a one-way road, or
flights in one direction might have different costs than those the
other way. 

<p>We are going to make a big assumption: that all the edges have
lengths that are positive numbers. This is often but not always the
case; it makes sense in the examples above, but it is conceivable
that an airline could pay people to take certain routes, so that
the lengths of those edges in the airport graph might be negative.
We'll pretend this never happens. It makes the algorithms a lot
easier. Later we'll see some special cases where we can handle
negative weights.</p>

<p><a name="sssp">Rather than computing one distance d(s,t), we'll
compute d(s,x) for all vertices x. This is known as the <i>single
source shortest path problem</i> (s is the <i>source</i>). It turns
out that computing this extra information makes things easier,
because then we can put together information about paths with fewer
edges to get paths with more edges.</a></p>

<h2>Paths from distances</h2>

Suppose we already know the distances d(s,x) from s to every other
vertices. This isn't a solution to the shortest path problem,
because we want to know actual paths having those distances. How
can we find those paths? That there are two kinds of shortest
paths: those formed by a single edge (s,t), and those in which the
path from s to t goes through some other vertices; let's say x is
the last vertex the path goes through before t. Then in the second
case, the overall path must be formed by concatenating a path from
s to x with edge (x,t). (We can view both types of shortest path as
being similar if we think of the shortest path from s to s as being
one with no edges in it.) Further, the path from s to x must itself
be a shortest path (since otherwise concatenating the shortest path
with (x,t) would decrease the length of the overall path). A final
observation is that d(s,x) must be less than d(s,t), since
d(s,x)=d(s,t)+length(x,t) and we are assuming all edges have
positive length. 

<p>Therefore if we only know the correct value of x we can find a
shortest path:</p>

<p><b>Algorithm 1:</b></p>

<pre>
    for each vertex y in sorted order by d(s,y)
    let (x,y) be an edge with d(s,x)+length(x,y)=d(s,y)
    path(s,y) = path(s,x) + edge (x,y)
</pre>

We will want to use something like this idea to compute shortest
paths without already knowing their lengths. When we get to y in
the loop, it will still be ok to use terms like d(s,x) if this is
less than d(s,y), because we will have already processed x in a
previous iteration. But the pseudo-code above uses d(s,y) itself
twice, and this will not work as well. 

<p>To get rid of the second use of d(s,y), in which we test to
determine which edge to use, we can notice that (because we are
computing a shortest path) d(s,x)+length(x,y) will be less than any
similar expression, so instead of testing it for equality with
d(s,y) we can just find a minimum:</p>

<p><b>Algorithm 2:</b></p>

<pre>
    for each vertex y in sorted order by d(s,y)
    let (x,y) be an edge with x already processed,
        minimizing d(s,x)+length(x,y)
    path(s,y) = path(s,x) + edge (x,y)
    d(s,y) = d(s,x) + length(x,y)
</pre>

<h2>Dijkstra's algorithm</h2>

The only remaining use of d(s,y) in this algorithm is to determine
what order to process the vertices in. <i><a href= 
"people.html#dijkstra">Dijkstra</a>'s algorithm</i> for shortest
paths does this almost exactly like <a href="960206.html#prim">
Prim's algorithm</a>. Remember that in Prim's algorithm, we add
vertices and edges one a a time to a tree, at each step choosing
the shortest possible edge to add. Dijkstra's algorithm does the
same thing, only choosing the edge to add at each step to be the
one minimizing d(s,x)+length(x,y). 

<p><b>Algorithm 3:</b> (Dijkstra, basic outline)</p>

<pre>
    let T be a single vertex s
    while (T has fewer than n vertices)
    {
    find edge (x,y)
        with x in T and y not in T
        minimizing d(s,x)+length(x,y)
    add (x,y) to T
    d(s,y)=d(s,x)+length(x,y)
    }
</pre>

<p>The actual shortest paths can be found by following the path in
T from s to t. This defines a structure known as a "shortest path
tree". In practice it may sometimes faster to build two trees, one
from s and one from t, and stop when they run into each other (this
usually ends up visiting less of the graph).</p>

<p>Just like with Prim's algorithm, we can use heaps to perform the
hard part of each iteration (finding the best edge) in logarithmic
time.</p>

<p><b>Algorithm 4:</b> (Dijkstra with heaps)</p>

<pre>
    make a heap of values (vertex,edge,distance)
    initially (v,-,infinity) for each vertex
    let tree T be empty
    while (T has fewer than n vertices)
    {
    let (v,e,d(v)) have the smallest weight in the heap
    remove (v,e,d(v)) from the heap
    add v and e to T
    set distance(s,v) to d(v)
    for each edge f=(v,u)
        if u is not already in T
        find value (u,g,d(u)) in heap
        if d(v)+length(f) &lt; d(g)
            replace (u,g,d(g)) with (u,f,d(v)+length(f))
    }
</pre>

Just as in Prim's algorithm, this runs in time O(m log n) if you
use binary heaps, or O(m + n log n) if you use Fibonacci heaps. 

<h2>Dijkstra and negative lengths</h2>

Dijkstra's algorithm does not work with negative edge weights. For
instance, consider the following graph (assume the edges are all
directed from left to right): 

<pre>
       2
    A-----B
     \   /
    3 \ / -2
       C
</pre>

If we start with A, Dijkstra's algorithm will choose the edge (A,x)
minimizing d(A,A)+length(edge), namely (A,B). It then sets d(A,B)=2
and chooses another edge (y,C) minimizing d(A,y)+d(y,C); the only
choice is (A,C) and it sets d(A,C)=3. But it never finds the
shortest path from A to B, via C, with total length 1. 

<h2>Topological ordering and shortest paths</h2>

There is an important class of graphs in which shortest paths can
be computed more quickly, in linear time. The idea is to go back to
algorithms 1 and 2, which required you to visit the vertices in
some order. In those algorithms we defined the order to be sorted
by distance from s, which as we have seen works for positive weight
edges, but not if there are negative weights. <a name="topo">Here's
another ordering that always works: define a <i>topological
ordering</i> of a directed graph to be one in which, whenever we
have an edge from x to y, the ordering visits x before y.</a> If we
can define such an ordering, then we can do something like
algorithm 2, and be sure that the predecessor of a vertex x is
always processed before we process x itself. 

<p><b>Algorithm 5:</b> (shortest paths from topological order)</p>

<pre>
    for each vertex y in a topological ordering of G
    choose edge (x,y) minimizing d(s,x)+length(x,y)
    path(s,y) = path(s,x) + edge (x,y)
    d(s,y) = d(s,x) + length(x,y)
</pre>

<a name="long">This runs in linear time (with the possible
exception of finding the ordering), and works even when the graph
has negative length edges. You can even use it to find longest
paths: just negate the lengths of all the edges. The only catch is
that it only works when we can find a topological ordering.</a> 

<h2>Topological ordering and acyclic graphs</h2>

Define a <i>directed acyclic graph</i> (often known as a DAG for
short) to be a directed graph, containing no cycle (a cycle is a
set of edges forming a loop, and all pointing the same way around
the loop). 

<p>Theorem: a graph has a topological ordering if and only if it is
a directed acyclic graph.</p>

<p>One direction of the proof is simple: suppose G is not a DAG, so
it has a cycle. In any ordering of G, one vertex of the cycle has
to come first, but then one of the two cycle edges at that vertex
would point the wrong way for the ordering to be topological. In
the other direction, we have to prove that every graph without a
topological ordering contains a cycle. We'll prove this by finding
an algorithm for constructing topological orderings; if the
algorithm ever gets stuck we'll be able to use that information to
find a cycle.</p>

<p><b>Algorithm 6:</b> (topological ordering)</p>

<pre>
    list L = empty
    while (G is not empty)
    find a vertex v with no incoming edges
    delete v from G
    add v to L
</pre>

If this algorithm terminates, L is a topological ordering, since we
only add a vertex v when all its incoming edges have been deleted,
at which point we know its predecessors are already all in the
list. 

<p>What if it doesn't terminate? The only thing that could go wrong
is that we could be unable to find a vertex with no incoming edges.
In this case all vertices have some incoming edge. We want to prove
that in this case, G has a cycle. Start with any vertex s, follow
its incoming edge backwards to another vertex t, follow its
incoming edge backwards again, and so on, building a chain of
vertices ...w-&gt;v-&gt;u-&gt;t-&gt;s.</p>

<p>We can keep stepping backwards like this forever, but there's
only a finite number of vertices in the graph. Therefore, we'll
eventually run into a vertex we've seen before:
u-&gt;w-&gt;v-&gt;u-&gt;t-&gt;s. In this case, u-&gt;w-&gt;v-&gt;u
is a directed cycle. This procedure always finds a directed cycle
whenever algorithm 6 gets stuck, completing the proof of the
theorem that a graph has a topological ordering if and only if it
is a DAG. Incidentally this also proves that algorithm 6 finds a
topological ordering whenever one exists, and that we can use
algorithm 6 to test whether a graph is a DAG. Putting algorithm 6
together with the "stepping backwards" procedure provides a fast
method of finding cycles in graphs that are not DAGs.</p>

<p>Finally, let's analyze the topological ordering algorithm. The
key step (finding a vertex without incoming edges) seems to require
scanning the whole graph, but we can speed it up with some really
simple data structures: a count I[v] of the number of edges
incoming to v, and a list K of vertices without incoming edges.</p>

<p><b>Algorithm 7:</b> (topological ordering, detailed
implementation)</p>

<pre>
    list K = empty
    list L = empty
    for each vertex v in G
    let I[v] = number of incoming edges to v
    if (I[v] = 0) add v to K
    while (G is not empty)
    remove a vertex v from K
    for each outgoing edge (v,w)
    decrement I[w]
    if (I[w] = 0) add w to K
    add v to L
</pre>

It is not hard to see that this algorithm runs in linear time, so
combining it with algorithm 5 we see that we can find shortest
paths in DAGs in linear time.
