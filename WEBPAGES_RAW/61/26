<h2>Interests</h2>

<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>

My dissertation and subsequent research focused on automated reasoning and
machine learning.

<p>

<h3>University Computer Science Education</h3>

At UC Irvine I taught Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering,
Social Impacts of Computerization, Computer Graphics, and
Introductory Programming.

<p>

In 2001, 2002, and 2012 I was voted the "Outstanding Professor" by the
graduating seniors in ICS.

<p>

<h3>K-12 Computer Science Education</h3>

I <a href="https://k12cs.org/biographies/">co-wrote</a> 
the
<a href="https://k12cs.org/">K-12 Computer Science Framework</a>.

<p>

I chaired the Computer Science Teachers Association committee that wrote
<a href="https://csta.acm.org/Curriculum/sub/CurrFiles/L1-Objectives-and-Outlines.pdf">
A Model Curriculum for K-12 Computer Science: Level I Objectives and Outlines</a>.

<p>
I was Principal Investigator on a $600,000
<a href="http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0739304">National Science Foundation grant</a>
that brought computer science, game design, and cultural education to
American Indian high school students, who
created games that retold traditional stories and cultural practices.

<p>
My 1997 paper
<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1227417&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=638429042&CFTOKEN=24775340">Fourth Grade Computer Science</a>
has been credited with making a significant contribution to the recent upswing in
computer science education at the primary and secondary levels.

<p>

<h3>Video Game Design and Programming</h3>

I cofounded UC Irvine's
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/degrees/degree_cgs.php">
major in Computer Game Science</a>, and for several years was
chair of the CGS Steering Committee.

<p>

I taught courses in Game Design, Game Engines, and Games and Society.
