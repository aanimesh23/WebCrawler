Machine learning investigates the mechanisms by which knowledge is acquired through experience. Research at UCI spans the spectrum of models for learning, including those based on statistics, logic, mathematics, neural structures, information theory, and heuristic search algorithms. 
<p>
Our research involves the development and analysis of algorithms that identify patterns in observed data in order to make predictions about unseen data. New learning algorithms often result from research into the effect of problem properties on the accuracy and run-time of existing algorithms. 
<p>
We investigate learning from structured databases (for applications such as screening loan applicants), image data (for applications such as character recognition), and text collections (for applications such as locating relevant sites on the World Wide Web). UCI also maintains the international machine learning database repository, an archive of over 100 databases used specifically for evaluating machine learning algorithms. <p>
