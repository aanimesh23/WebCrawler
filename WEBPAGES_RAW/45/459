<b>Download/Install the Cygwin Toolset</b>
<p>
<b>Cygwin</b> is a collection of GNU and Open Source tools that provide a
     Linux-like environment for Windows: using it we can install and
     use <b>llvm</b> (which includes the <b>GCC</b> compilers),
     <b>Clang</b> (which includes <b>Clang</b> compilers),
     <b>GDB</b> (a debugger used by both compilers),
     and <b>make</b>/<b>cmake</b> (tools that which we use to specify how to
     build -compile and link- C++ programs).
   Cygwin and it toolset occupy about 1.7 GB on disk.
<p>
In this handout you will download and install the Cygwin toolset; in the
  next you will download a version of <b>CLion</b>, an Integrated Development
  Environment (IDE) for using these tools (or you can choose to use these
  tools via a command-line).
<p>
You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing Cygwin and its toolset.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely, before performing the action that it
  describes.

<h3>Downloading and Installing</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click
       <a href="https://cygwin.com/install.html" target="_blank">
     Cygwin64</a>
    <p>
    The following <b>Cygwin</b>
      home page should appear in your browser.
    <p>
    <img src="images/cygwin/Cygwin Home Page.jpg">
    <p>

<li>Click the <b>setup-x86_64.exe</b> link on that page, which downloads that
       executable file: executing this file will install the 64-bit version of
       Cygwin.
    <blockquote>
    On some browswers the following pop-up window will appear on your screen.
       <p>
       <img src="images/cygwin/Opening.jpg">

    If you see this window, click its <b>Save File</b> button.
    </blockquote>

    After downloading this file, its icon will appear on your screen as
      follows. 
       <p>
       <img src="images/cygwin/Executable.jpg">
       <p>
    Save this file for future use, in case you need to install more Cygwin
      tools: on my system I stored this file as
     <b>C:\ZData\Installed Software\setup-x86_64.exe</b>
<p>

<li>Double-click the <b>setup-x86_64.exe</b> file.

    <p>
    The following <b>User Account Control</b>
      pop-up window <b>might</b> appear on your screen.

    <img src="images/cygwin/Cygwin Setup - Choose Installation Type.jpg">
    <p>
    Ensure the <b>Install from Internet</b> radio button is pushed
      (the default).
<p>

<li>Click the <b>Next&gt;</b> button on this window.
    <p>
    The following <b>Cygwin Setup - Choose Installation Directory</b>

    <p>
    <img src="images/cygwin/Cygwin Setup - Choose Installation Directory.jpg">
    <p>
    For simplicity and consistency, ensure the <b>Root Directory</b> is
       <b>C:\cygwin64</b> (the default); the <b>All Users (RECOMMENDED)</b>
       radio button should be pushed (the default).
<p>

    <img src="images/cygwin/Cygwin Setup - Select Local Package Directory.jpg">
    <p>
    This is a temporary directory in which Cygwin will create folders that it
      downloads files into; it will delete the files/folders here before
      finishing.
    For simplicity and consistency, use the default
     <b>Local Package Directory</b>.
<p>

    I would leave the top one (<b>http://cygwin.mirror.constant.com</b>)
      selected (the default).

    <p>
    You may want to midimize this window so that it does not fill your screen.
    <p>
    Notice that the <b>Search</b> textbox is empty.
    In the steps below you enter tool names and will specify installing
      <b>Devel</b>ment for each.
    At the end of this process, after selecting all packages, you will
      click the <b>Next&gt;</b> button.
    <p>

        By clicking the word to the right of <b>Devel</b> multiple times, it
          cycles through all its possible values (default, install, reinstall,

    <blockquote>
    Cygwin automatically installs the <b>vim</b> text editor.
        If you would like to install the <b>emacs</b> editor</b>
    <p>
    Type <b>emacs</b> into the textbox; the possible tools related to this

        When they do, to the right of just the words <b>Devel</b> and

    <p>
    <img src="images/cygwin/Cygwin Setup - Select Packages emacs.jpg">

    </blockquote>
    </ul>
<p>

<li>Click the <b>Next&gt;</b> button on this window.
    <p>
    The following <b>Cygwin Setup - Resolving Dependencies</b>

    <p>

<li>Click the <b>Next&gt;</b> button on this window.
    <p>
    The following <b>Cygwin Setup</b> progress
      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/cygwin/Cygwin Setup Progress.jpg">
    <p>
    It will cycle through the Downloading, Installing, and Running tasks.
    Downloading itself might take minutes (depending on your connection
      speed); Installing and Running can also take minutes.
    On my machine, with a fast connection speed, the entire process took about
      10 minutes; sometimes it will pause for a few seconds (often with
      <b>0%</b> progress showing on the window: let it finish).
    <p>
    Eventually this window will be replaced by the following
      <b>Cygwin Setup - Installation Status and Create Icons</b> 
      window on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/cygwin/Cygwin Setup - Installation Status and Create Icons.jpg">
    <p>
    I recommend that you leave checked the <b>Create icon on Desktop</b>
      checkbox, and uncheck the <b>Add icon to Start Menu</b> checkbox.
    Place the <img src="images/cygwin/cygwin64terminal.jpg">
     (Cygwing64 Terminal icon) on your
      desktop in convenient place (especially if you plan to use this Cygwin
      toolset with a Command Line instead of CLion).

<li>Click the <b>Finish</b> button on this window.
<p>
   

<li>
Finally, place <b>C:\cygwin64\bin</b> on the <b>Path</b>, so that the
  <b>Cygwin</b> toolset is available for use.
    <ul>
    <li>Click <b>Start</b>
    <li>Click <b>Control Panel</b>
    <li>Click <b>System and Security</b>
    <li>Click <b>System</b>
    <li>Click <b>Advance system settings</b>
    <p>
    </ul>
    The following <b>System Properties</b>
      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/cygwin/systemproperties.jpg">
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Click <b>Enviroment Variables...</b>
    <p>
    </ul>
    Something like the following <b>System Properties</b>
      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images//cygwin/environmentvariables.jpg">
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>In the <b>System variables</b> (lower) part, scroll to line starting
           with <b>Path</b> and click that line (which should become
           highlighted).
        <blockquote>
        <b>IMPORTANT: Even though you see a highlighted PATH in the User
             variables (top part) look for Path (not CLASSPATH) in the lower
             part to change it.</b>
        </blockquote>
    <p>
    <li>Click <b>Edit...</b>
    <p>
    <li>Copy the text <b>C:\cygwin64\bin;</b>
          (include everything from <b>C</b> to <b>;</b>) and then paste
          it at the very start of the <b>Variable Value</b> text entry.
        <p>
        When done, the <b>Edit System Variable</b> pop-up window should look
          something like
    <p>
    <img src="images/cygwin/path.jpg">
    <p>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b> for each of the pop-up windows above, to terminate them
          (3 <b>OK</b>s total), and delete (<b>X</b>) the <b>System</b> window.
    </ul>
</ol>
<p>

The Cygwin toolset (all the necessary programming tools) are now installed.
You are now ready to install the <a href="clion.html">CLion IDE</a>
