TOPIC:	WHEN DISCIPLINES MEET:
	VORONOI METHODS IN GEOMATICS

ABSTRACT

Occasionally, a new technique appears that has the potential to
significantly modify a discipline. At present it appears that recent
developments in Voronoi diagram methods in Computational Geometry have the
potential to change many of the ways we look at spatial problems in the
discipline of Geomatics, or Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

In an attempt to escape from some of the limitations of traditional GIS
data structures, the Voronoi diagram is an attractive alternative - it is
a space-filling structure, eliminating many problems of the
line-intersection spatial model. It has various forms in various
dimensions, and by making it fully dynamic the traditional GIS operations
may be extended in new directions.

A variety of GIS-type problems will be described, along with possible
solutions. The real challenge for the future is not only to implement more
efficient versions of traditional GIS functions, but to see how the two
disciplines may combine to produce completely new functionality.
