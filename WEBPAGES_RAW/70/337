<EM><strong><font size=+1>Versioned Java Packages in the JP Programming Environment</em></strong></em><br>

<p>

As part of an investigation of scalable development techniques for 
systems written in the Java(TM) programming language, the Forest
Project at Sun Microsystems Laboratories is building JP, an 
experimental programming environment. This talk will describe key 
technologies and directions in JP: reliable system building 
(replacing make), orthogonally persistent object storage using PJama, 
tool integration via Java interfaces, and versioned Java packages 
as a unifying concept.

<p>

<strong>Biography:</strong>
Michael L. Van De Vanter is a member of the Forest Project 
at Sun Microsystems Laboratories, which is investigating software 
development technologies and persistent object systems. He has 
previously worked in the industry and taught at California Polytechnic 
State University at San Luis Obispo. He holds a B.S. in Mathematics 
from Stanford University, a M.S. in Computer Science from M.I.T., 
and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of California 
Berkeley. His research interests include software development technology, 
the human factors of software development, and advanced program 
editing systems.

<EM><strong><font size=+1>The New Age of Technical Collaboration in the Enterprise</em></strong></em><br>

<p>

The enterprise development environment is changing in several 
significant ways due primarily to two factors. The first factor 
is that development resources are becoming more and more distributed. 
As a direct result of the Internet and the scarcity of key development 
resources, the ability to communicate with and coordinate geographically-
dispersed project resources is a key development requirement. The second 
factor is that the contributors to the development effort have increasingly 
diverse backgrounds, not all of which are technical. For example, the 
advent of web development has directly involved sales and marketing in 
the development effort, but these team members are often overwhelmed by 
the technical complexity of most Software Configuration Management products. 
Until development tools that address these factors are deployed in the 
enterprise, true technical collaboration will not occur. StarTeam 3.0, 
which will be demonstrated during this presentation, was designed to 
address these factors and promote enterprise-wide technical collaboration.

<strong>Biography:</strong>
As one of founders of StarBase, Steve has been involved 
in the design, development, and marketing of tools for technical 
collaboration for over five years. Starting with the Windows-based 
Versions product, Steve was directly involved in the design and 
development of StarTeam, a software configuration management tool 
that combines version control, change management, and knowledge 
sharing. With the latest release, StarTeam provides web browser 
interfaces, Java based class interfaces, and platform independent 
access. Prior to StarBase, Steve has held the positions of vice 
president at a major Savings and Loan and lead software engineer at 
Ashton-Tate.
