Sometimes you can get people to agree on the answer even when they
can't agree on the question. So I'm not so worried about divergent
goals. On the other hand, a Functional Requirements document would be
the right way to deal with the issue of common goals. Does someone
(not me) want to draft a Functional Requirements document and submit
it by next Thursday as an Internet Draft? (Mainly just to raise
awareness of the issue.)

I was hoping also that some things would get discussed at a July 8 f2f
meeting at NaviSoft, but I hadn't heard back about whether the July 10
meeting could get moved. (The DMA technical committee meets in the SF
bay area July 9-12.)

If Navisoft can't host on July 8, I could probably arrange to host the
meeting at Xerox PARC.
