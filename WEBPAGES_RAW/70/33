			<p align =justify>
				In this paper we evaluate several in-memory algorithms for efficient and 
				scalable processing of continuous range queries over collections of moving 
				objects. Constant updates to the index are avoided by query indexing. No 
				constraints are imposed on the speed or path of moving objects. We present a 
				detailed analysis of a grid approach which shows the best results for both 
				skewed and uniform data. A sorting based optimization is developed for 
				significantly improving the cache hit ratio. Experimental evaluation 
				establishes that indexing queries using the Grid index yields orders of 
				magnitude better performance than other index structures such as R*-trees.
