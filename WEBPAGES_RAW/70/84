Stackless traversal algorithms for ray tracing acceleration structures
require significantly less storage per ray than ordinary stack-based
ones. This advantage is important for massively parallel rendering
methods, where there are many rays in flight. On SIMD architectures, a
commonly used acceleration structure is the MBVH, which has multiple
bounding boxes per node for improved parallelism. It scales to
branching factors higher than two, for which, however, only
stack-based traversal methods have been proposed so far. In this
paper, we introduce a novel stackless traversal algorithm for MBVHs
with up to four-way branching. Our approach replaces the stack with a
small bitmask, supports dynamic ordered traversal, and has a low
computation overhead.
