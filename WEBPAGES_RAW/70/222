<h1>
Parallel External Memory Graph Algorithms
</h1>

<h2>Nodari Sitchinava</h2>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
I will be presenting new results in Parallel External Memory model. In 
particular I will talk about solutions to List ranking, Euler tour 
technique and its application to problems on trees, finding connected 
components and the minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph.
<P>
This is joint work with Lars Arge and Mike Goodrich.
