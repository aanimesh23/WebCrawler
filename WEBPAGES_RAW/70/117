<H2>Architecture</H2></A>

The influence of computational geometry in architecture is mainly
indirect but multifaceted, via <A HREF="graphics.html">computer
graphics</A> for
architectural visualization, <A HREF="vreal.html">virtual reality</A>
for simulated walkthroughs, <A HREF="cad.html">computer aided design</A>,
<A HREF="carto.html">geographic information systems</A> for land use planning,
and <A HREF="meshgen.html">finite element methods</A> for structural simulation
(see [Alexander, Black, and Tsutsui, "The Mary Rose Museum", Oxford
1995] for a nice example of a design informed by this last consideration).
However it seems likely that within each of those areas, special problems arise
in dealing with architectural information, and that more direct
connections can also be made.

Tom Kelly appears to be creating artificial cityscapes by using Voronoi diagrams of sites with lots of collinearity to form the city blocks and streets, similar Voronoi diagrams within the blocks to form property boundaries and building floorplans, and straight skeletons for the rooflines.
