<b>Overall Suggestions for Pre-Award and Grant Award</b>
<ul>
  <li>Consult with O3 to (a) identify and capture any Pre-Award 	improvements 
they can provide. For example, can they characterize 	types or groups of pre-approved,
never-approved, insufficient-funds 	proposals? Automated award notice distribution?
Input from O8 	for not-approved proposals? Clarify responsibilities for 	who
will verify or validate proposal funding and budget information?    </li>
  <li>Develop strategy and plan for realizing "full" TO-BE vision. 	Initial 
version due 24 September 96. </li>
  <li>Need resolution and convergence of <em>electronic proposal</em> 	definition, 
design, implementation, and integration. </li>
</ul>
<p><b><em>Pre-Award</em></b></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Evaluate_Proposal</em><b>(1a)</b>: Update ONR Proposal Submission
 	Guidelines on ONR WWW pages to solicit more complete proposal 	information 
(e.g., Identify BAA #, Certifications, Submittals). 	Consult Code 254 (Terry 
Young), ONR Webmaster (Code 92). </li>
  <li><em>Evaluate_Proposal</em><b>(1b)</b>: Send Letter to Offeror (University
 	Business Office) requesting additional or missing proposal  	information; 
Mail returned to designated GS.  </li>
  <li><em>Approve_PR</em><b>(1c)</b>: Determine when O3 can use daily releases
 	or IF actions. (Consult O3) </li>
  <li><em>Approve_PR</em><b>(3)</b>: Automate PR Assignment to GS. Assignments
 	to occur before proposal arrival. Deletes later (AS-IS) process 	step for 
manual Assigning PR to GS. Consult Code 21, 24, 25, 92. </li>
  <li><em>Approve_PR</em><b>(2)</b>: Automate "Proposal_Received" Notice
 	in Code 25. Consult Tricia. </li>
  <li><em>Assemble_PR_Package</em><b>(1d)</b>: Eliminate Hard Copy PRs. 	This 
    <em>deletes</em> AS-IS steps for Print, Sort, Compare, 	and Carry Hard 
Copy Proposals.   </li>
  <li><em>O2 Handle_Approved_Proposal</em><b>(3)</b>: 	Delete manual Assignment 
of PR to GS. Activity done earlier with 	automated support. </li>
  <li><em>Validate_PR_Package</em><b>(1e)</b>: Delete Validate Hard Copy with
 	PR. Discuss and clarify validation and verification responsibilities  	with
O3 (already noted). Rename Verify_CAGE_SCCC_Codes to	 	Verify/Obtain_Codes.
   </li>
  <li><em>Obtain_Missing_Information</em><b>(1e)</b>: Delete FAX_Request
 	Missing Information, unless 1a and 1b fail.	 	Also, rename to Update_Missing_Data_Received.
   </li>
</ul>
<p><b><em>Grant_Award</em></b></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Print_Sign_Document</em><b>(2)</b>: Add Obligate Grant Data in STARS.
 	 </li>
  <li><em>Prepare_Deliver_Package_to_FM</em><b>(2)</b>: Delete AS-IS steps 
for: 	Copy Cover Page, Copy FAD, Copy Signatures, Place on Pending Review
 	Shelf, Log Data Sent to FM in INRIS, and Deliever Package to FM. 	Consult 
Codes 08, 21, 25, 92.  </li>
  <li><em>Prepare_Deliver_Package_to_FM</em><b>(2)</b>: Delete 	Obligate Data
in STARS  (moved up earlier in process). </li>
  <li><em>Distribution</em><b>(2)</b>: Delete Pickup Document, Log Date 	Returned, 
Match File.  </li>
  <li><em>Distribution</em><b>(4)</b>: Automate 100% Distribution  	(by 31
March 97). This depends on availability of adequate 	ADP information infrastructure. 
Consult Codes 08, 24, 25, 92, DFAS, 	and selected Universities for pilot tests.
  </li>
  <li><em>Distribution</em><b>(4)</b>: Need approval to forego File 	Hard 
Copy Documents. Consult Codes 08, 25, and OOCC. </li>
</ul>
<b>Overall suggestions for improvements  in <em>Grant Adminstration</em> 
and <em>Close-Out</em> Processes</b>
<ul>
  <li>All improvements to Grant Administration and Close-Out are priority 
"4" items, requiring more than 90 days to complete. </li>
  <li>ONR Field Operations  perform Grant/Contract Administration and Grant/Contract 
Close-Out for ONR and other government agencies (e.g., Darpa, NASA), However, 
we only address improvements in ONR Grant Administration and Close-Out at 
this time. Handling Contracts and non-ONR grants is likely to benefit from 
the same kinds of improvements identified here, but getting them implementing 
is a major challenge. </li>
  <li>Improvements in Grant Administration Functions were not specified at 
this time, since these activities are demand-driven. Capturing these processes 
requires further effort. Nonetheless, the provision of an electronic proposal 
and grant document folder was expected to help streamline the efficiency and
effectiveness of these ongoing grant administration functions. </li>
  <li>Three transitions or transition events are needed to redesign nearly 
all of Grant Administration and Close-Out. These are             
    <ul>
      <li><b>4a:</b><em>        Provision of Electronic Grants Packages using
INRIS</em>. Scheduled        for delivery by February 1997. This eliminates 
all tasks and        actions involved in Grant Administration that receive, 
sort,        distribute, and resolve problems with grants, except for the
        remaining need to handle new contractors, as they occur.        </li>
      <li><b>4b:</b><em>        Integration of CAMIS and INRIS</em>. Scheduled 
for completion        by March 1997. This streamlines away all tasks and actions
that        involve the manual transfer and re-entry of information between
       INRIS and CAMIS.        </li>
      <li><b>4c:</b><em>        Provision of an Electronic Proposal and Grants 
Documents Folder</em>.        Not yet scheduled. This represents a new technical 
capability        that could be prototyped using USC's Distributed Hypertext 
(DHT)        information infrastructure that could integrate INRIS, CAMIS,
        and other information systems together over a <em>Grants Management
        Intranet</em> for ONR.        </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Develop strategy and plan for realizing "full" TO-BE vision.       
   
    <ul>
      <li>Need resolution and convergence of <em>electronic proposal 	and
grant folder</em> 	definition, design, implementation, and integration. 	</li>
