Arcadia Papers: ABSTRACT</H1>
<HR>

<A HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/users/andre/papers/position.ps">
"<B>Does Configuration Management Research Have a Future?</B>"</A>,
by Andre van der Hoek, Dennis Heimbigner, and Alexander L. Wolf, to
appear in <I>Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Software
Configuration Management</I>, Seattle, Washington, April 24-25,
1995.

<H2> Abstract </H2>

In this position paper we raise the question of whether Configuration
Management (CM) research has a future. The new standard in CM
systems--typified by commercial products such as Adele, ADC, ClearCase,
Continuus/CM, and CCC/Harvest--largely satisfies the CM functionality
requirements posed by Dart. This implies that research in the area of CM
is either unnecessary or that we must find new challenges in CM on which to
focus.  We believe that these challenges indeed exist.  Here we present
some areas that we feel are good opportunities for new or continued CM
research, and therefore conclude that CM research <I>does</I> have a future.
