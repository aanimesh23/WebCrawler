<p><strong><a name="dourish_keynote"></a>Dourish gives opening keynote and invited talk in Australia</strong></p>
<div class="img_caption_left"> <img alt="photo: paul dourish" height="90" src="../../../bin/img/photos/faculty/jpd.jpg" width="70"/>
<p><strong>Paul<br/>
                  Dourish</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Informatics professor <strong>Paul Dourish</strong> recently gave the opening keynote talk for the OzCHI conference, the annual Australasian Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, held in Cairns in Queensland, Australia. </p>
<p>Dourish's talk titled "Postcolonial Computing: Reframing the Cultural Dimensions of HCI Design" draws lessons from postcolonial studies to sketch some alternative frameworks for understanding the changing relationship between HCI design practice and the breadth of habitat and habitus with which it engages. </p>
<p>French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu used the term "habitus" to refer to the sedimented patterns of thought and dispositions that we acquire through participation in sociocultural settings.</p>
<p> Linking habitat with habitus is particularly appropriate now, as recent years have seen increasing attention paid the broadening contexts of information technology use from office and work settings to public and domestic space, and more broadly, out into the natural world of our everyday (and not-so-everyday) experience. </p>
<p>These sorts of spreads of technology and technological practice have necessitated the development of new modes of analysis and design, often drawing on different disciplines.</p>
<p>As human computer interaction (HCI) is beginning to turn its attention to how technologies move between different cultural settings, the research often raises more questions that it answers.  Just what does culture mean? What does it mean for technologies to be "portable" across places and settings&#8212;or for methods?</p>
<p>Dourish also gave an invited talk at Queensland University of Technology, in Bribane, Queensland, Australia: "Persuasive Technologies, Ecotopian Agendas, and the Morality of Consumption: Rethinking the Relationship between Human-Computer Interaction and Environmental Sustainability".</p>
<p>Many HCI researchers have recently begun to examine the opportunities to use ICTs to promote environmental sustainability and ecological consciousness on the part of technology users. </p>
<p>In particular, contemporary technologies -- including mobile devices and ambient displays -- can be imagined to provide opportunities for reflection on personal and collective action, or for monitoring and visualization of behavior and its relationship to environmental change. </p>
<p>These efforts exploit recent explorations of the use of computers as persuasive technologies in domains such as health and fitness.</p>
<p>Dourish's primary research interests are in the areas of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Human-Computer Interaction, and Ubiquitous Computing. He is especially interested in the foundational relationships between social scientific analysis and technological design.</p>
<p>Recent research topics include flexible attribute-based group information repositories, visual techniques to aid people in making assessments of system security, phenomenological analyses of interaction with embodied computational devices, and conceptual frameworks for privacy in information environments.</p>

<p><strong>NOVEMBER 2008</strong></p>
<p><strong><a name="newman_topicmapping"></a>Newman receives $40,000 Google Research Award for topic mapping</strong></p>
<div class="img_caption_left"> <img alt="photo: david newman" height="90" src="../../../bin/img/photos/faculty/newman.jpg" width="70"/>
<p><strong>David<br/>
                      Newman</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>David Newman</strong>, a research scientist in computer science, has received $40,000 from Google to research how topic mapping (topic modeling + mapping) can be used in conjunction with Google Maps interfaces to improve the ways users browse huge text collections.</p>
<p>A linear list of search results inhibits a user's ability to browse returned documents and leaves the user with little sense of the range of subject matter contained in the returned documents.</p>
<p>Newman will investigate novel ways of improving browse to allow users to find interesting, relevant and useful documents.  Newman will combine state-of-the-art statistical topic modeling with multidimensional scaling and visualization techniques to create a Google Maps-type interface for browsing huge text collections.</p>
<p>Using two huge collections of text documents (PubMed abstracts and books from the Open Content Alliance) Newman will investigate how to construct intuitive and meaningful layouts of documents to help users better find useful documents, and improve their overall browse experience.</p>
<p>Newman's research interests include machine learning, data mining and text mining.  His research is marked by a commitment to combining theoretical advances with practical applications in ways that widen access and use for individuals and communities, and ultimately improve the way people find and discover information.</p>

<p>Computer Science professors <strong>Tony Givargis</strong> and <strong>Alexandru Nicolau</strong>, along with Ph.D. student  Mohammad Ali Ghodrat have been awarded the 2008 CASES Best Paper Award for their submission entitled "Control Flow Optimization in Loops using Interval Analysis".  </p>
<p>The paper was presented in Atlanta, Georgia at the International Conference on Compilers, Architecture, and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES) last month.</p>
<p>The work presents a novel loop transformation technique, particularly well suited for optimizing embedded compilers, where an increase in compilation time is acceptable in exchange for significant performance increase. The transformation technique optimizes loops containing nested conditional blocks.</p>
<p><a href="http://givargis.ics.uci.edu/pubs/C37.pdf">The full paper can be downloaded online</a>.</p>
<p>The CASES conference provides a forum for emerging technology in embedded computing systems, with an emphasis on compilers and architectures for embedded systems. </p>
<p>CASES is a common forum for researchers with an interest in embedded systems to reach across vertically integrated communities and to promote synergies. As evident from the past CASES meetings, several emerging applications are critically dependent on these interactions for their sustained growth and evolution.</p>
<p>Givargis does research in the area of Software for Embedded Systems. He is currently investigating issues related to Realtime Operating System (RTOS) synthesis, serializing compilers, and code transformations techniques for efficient software to hardware migration.</p>
<p>Nicolau's work designs and implements a system of program transformations that supports the semi-automatic (and eventually fully-automatic) exploitation of substantially all the parallelism available in a given program.  Nicolau is also interested in developing a tool for the rigorous study and development of parallelizing compilers.</p>

<p><strong>Gary and Judy Olson</strong>, Bren Professors of Information and Computer Sciences, have released a new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Collaboration-Internet-Acting-Technology/dp/0262151200/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1226006045&amp;sr=8-1">Scientific Collaboration on the Internet</a>.</p>
<p>Modern science is increasingly collaborative, as signaled by rising numbers of coauthored papers, papers with international coauthors, and multi-investigator grants.</p>
<p>Historically, scientific collaborations were carried out by scientists in the same physical location&#8212;the Manhattan Project of the 1940s, for example, involved thousands of scientists gathered on a remote plateau in Los Alamos, New Mexico. </p>
<p>Today, information and communication technologies allow cooperation among scientists from far-flung institutions and different disciplines. Scientific Collaboration on the Internet provides both broad and in-depth views of how new technology is enabling novel kinds of science and engineering collaboration. The book offers commentary from notable experts in the field along with case studies of large-scale collaborative projects, past and ongoing.</p>
<p>The projects described range from the development of a national virtual observatory for astronomical research to a National Institutes of Health funding program for major multilaboratory medical research; from the deployment of a cyberinfrastructure to connect experts in earthquake engineering to partnerships between developed and developing countries in AIDS research.</p>
<p>The chapter authors speak frankly about the problems these projects encountered as well as the successes they achieved. The book strikes a useful balance between presenting the real stories of collaborations and developing a scientific approach to conceiving, designing, implementing, and evaluating such projects. It points to a future of scientific collaborations that build successfully on aspects from multiple disciplines.</p>
<p>Gary Olson, author of more than 100 published research articles, has dedicated his work to understanding how technology can support remote collaboration. He also has made important contributions to the studies of management practice and the cultural aspects of collaboration, as well as the complex socio-technical issues surrounding technology design.</p>
<p>Judy Olson has published about 110 peer-reviewed research articles and is best known for her work on distance collaborations and has achieved international acclaim for her studies that compared office workers in geographically distributed organizations to those working in the same location.</p>

<p>Computer science professor <strong>Aditi Majumder</strong> was recently invited to serve as a panelist at the IEEE/ACM Workshop on Projector-Camera Systems (PROCAMS).</p>
<p>Majumder talked about exploting a wireless computational projector-camera unit as the fundamental unit to deploy pixels in an ubiquitous manner.</p>
<p>The goal of her research is to instrument a workspace with a distributed network of these projector-camera units creating displays whose scale, resolution and form factor can be changed on demand; displays that are no longer a passive interface between the user and the machine, but can serve as an medium of interaction between multiple users and/or multiples machines.</p>
<p>According to Majumder, "the future would thus see the emergence of truly ubiquitous displays that can be deployed literally anywhere and in any fashion."</p>

<p>The project aims to design and demonstrate innovative and efficient cryptographic techniques that allow mutually protective parties to exchange information in a way that preserves both privacy of, and authorized access to that information. </p>
<p>A real-world example of such an exchange can be when a government agency wants to compare an airline passenger manifest with its terror watch-list. Neither the airline nor the agency may want to reveal its list to the other. </p>
<p>PPIT techniques will solve the apparent impasse by using state-of-the-art efficient cryptographic tools to share only the necessary information that match the two lists.</p>

<p>Associate Dean for Research Development and Professor of Computer Science <strong>Magda El Zarki</strong> has received five 5 D-Link Wireless Pan/Tilt Internet Cameras from D-LInk Systems.  </p>
<p>The cameras will be used in research that will investigate schemes that enable scientists to create dynamic network topologies that provide the networking resources for the sensors to transmit their data to an outgoing gateway. </p>
<p>Most wireless networks don't have the bandwidth to carry multiple video streams.  In tracking applications, sensors are not all active at the same time,  thereby allowing the pooling of resources to areas where there is current activity.  As the action moves, the network changes to migrate the resources to where they are needed.</p>
<p>This research will involve novel routing mechanisms, adaptive media sharing strategies and  workload distribution schemes.</p>
<p>El Zarki's work focuses on multimedia transmission and the impact of provisioning for quality of service networks. Her recent work has been in wireless communications. </p>
<p>El Zarki's research in real-time video transmission focuses on the impact of bandwidth control on quality degradation and use of objective quality-assessment techniques for video quality evaluation whose applications include video conferencing and low-bit rate Web video.</p>

Newman and his collaborators will study how topic modeling can be used to improve search and discovery of digital resources.</p>
<p>Newman and the team will investigate how topic modeling -- a state-of-the-art machine learning technique -- can be used to improve the ways users search, discover and find items in increasingly large digital collections. They will apply topic modeling to three important classes of digital library resources: full-text books, images, and tagged objects.</p>
<p>"I am excited to deploy advanced machine learning techniques that may positively impact the general public, and address the increasingly universal challenge of providing better access to huge collections of digital objects," says Newman.</p>
<p>In the research, topic modeling will be used on text metadata to better organize large collections of images; on library collections that contain millions of electronic volumes to go beyond keyword search; and social tags and contributed content to better categorize this increasingly widespread type of descriptive textual metadata. </p>
<p>The team will then build prototypes of user interface applications that use topic modeling, to assess the value of topic modeling for users.</p>

<p>Professor of Computer science <strong>Gene Tsudik</strong> and Professor of Informatics <strong>Alfred Kobsa</strong> have been awarded a $460,000 collaborative grant from the NSF Cybertrust program for a project titled "User-Aided Secure Association of Wireless Devices".</p>
<p>The cybertrust project is being conducted in collaboration with Nitesh Saxena, an ICS Ph.D. alum, and Assistant Professor at NYU Polytechnic Institute.</p>
<p>The popularity of personal gadgets opens up many new services for ordinary users. Many everyday usage scenarios involve two or more devices "working together" &#8211; for example, sensors and personal RFID tags. Before working together, devices must be securely "paired" to enable secure communication.</p>
<p>The human-imperceptible nature of wireless communication prompts the very real threat of Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks. </p>
<p>Another challenge arises due to the lack of a global security infrastructure.  Consequently, traditional cryptographic means alone are unsuitable, since unfamiliar devices have no prior security context and no common point of trust. </p>
<p>Therefore, some human involvement in secure device pairing is unavoidable. At the same time, most devices have limited hardware and/or user interfaces, thus complicating human involvement.</p>
<p>Since device pairing is one of the very few areas where security directly involves and affects the average user, the greatest impact of proposed research is expected to be the broader participation in security practices and better appreciation of security and its benefits.  The project also emphasizes industry outreach and technology transfer by working with manufacturers and industrial consortia.</p>
<p>The project&#8217;s end-goal is to construct a set of user-friendly, scalable and secure methods for sensor initialization.</p>
<p>Students taking part in the project are expected to acquire skills that uniquely interact at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Cybertrust.</p>
<p>Tsudik's research interests are mainly in computer/network security, privacy and applied cryptography. His recent work focuses on privacy in Internet services, RFID systems and mobile ad hoc networks, as well as security in sensor networks and storage systems. </p>
<p>His research also covers secure group communication, in particular, group key agreement, group signatures and group access control. He also is interested in database security and public key cryptography.</p>
<p>Kobsa's research lies in the areas of user modeling and personalized systems (with applications in the areas of information environments, expert finders, and user interfaces for disabled and elderly people), privacy, and in information visualization. </p>
<p>He is the editor of "User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction: The Journal of Personalization Research", edited several books and authored numerous publications in the areas of user-adaptive systems, human-computer interaction and knowledge representation.</p>

<p>Computer science professors <strong>David Eppstein</strong> and <strong>Michael Goodrich</strong> have been awarded $400,000 from the National Science Foundation for their study on Algorithms for Graphs on Surfaces.  </p>
<p>The research concept with applications to Geographic Information Systems and Computer Graphics includes methods for speeding up the modeling algorithms used by Disney Animation Studios in rendering characters featured in 3D animated features.</p>
<p>The research, which is a collaboration with Roberto Tamassia at Brown University, studies algorithms for embedding graphs on surfaces, algorithms for graphs embedded on surfaces, and applications of such algorithms.</p>
<p>"I am very excited to be exploring a topic like this, which impacts so many other areas, including networking, graphics, and theoretical computer science,&#8221; says Goodrich.</p>
<p>Technologies used on the Internet, as well as in navigation systems, are often based on algorithms for geometric graphs. Thus, additional work on such algorithms has a potential for improving these and other environments that depend on geometric graphs.</p>
<p>In addition, at a time when computers and networks are being misused at a growing rate, applications of algorithms for graphs on surfaces to computer security has the potential for protecting the public at large.</p>
<p>Goodrich's research is directed at the design of high-performance algorithms and data structures for solving large-scale problems surrounding the increased demands of computer graphics, information visualization, scientific data analysis, information assurance and security, and the Internet. He also is interested in computer science education, specifically ways of more effectively teaching data structures and algorithms.</p>
<p>Eppstein's research interests are varied and include geometric optimization, finite element mesh generation and mesh improvement, information visualization and graph drawing, robust statistics and estimation of web-graph properties, graph theory and graph algorithms, exponential-time algorithms for NP-hard problems, and cellular automata and combinatorial games.</p>

<p>Mozilla released the first alpha prototype of the next Firefox browser that incorporates a radically new compiler technology 
		        invented by professor of computer science <strong>Michael Franz</strong> and his former Ph.D. student <strong>Andreas Gal</strong>.</p>
<p>Franz and Gal invented a new method for building compilers that differs fundamentally from how compilers have been constructed during the previous 40 years. Key to the invention is a novel data structure called a "trace tree," that allows for building much smaller and faster compilers than previous approaches. </p>
<p>UC Irvine has filed for broad patent protection on this idea.</p>
<p>The new version of Firefox incorporates a new JavaScript compiler based on Franz and Gal's method that is up to 40 times faster than the previous version. Since Firefox is mostly written in JavaScript, the new compiler enables the browser's code to be optimized while it is running and more than doubles the speed of the browser. </p>
<p>Since typical Web 2.0 applications are heavily based on JavaScript, they will run about 700 percent faster than in the current browser and about 15 times faster than in Microsoft's Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>A version of the new Firefox can be downloaded from Mozilla's alpha site and it will become standard in Firefox 3.1, scheduled for 
			      release later this year.</p>
<p>Franz and Gal's research on trace-based compilation is supported by the National Science Foundation and by the California MICRO Program with industrial sponsor Sun Microsystems.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Andr&#233; van der Hoek</strong>, associate professor of Informatics, will use the unrestricted gift to support his research that is exploring new software engineering tools that assist development teams in avoiding conflicts
		        that arise from parallel work on the same code base.  </p>
<p>Van der Hoek will particularly use the funds to further the Palantir project, which has shown success in reducing the number and magnitude of conflicts via a strategy of continuous sharing of information about who changes which artifacts in parallel.</p>
<p>Professor van der Hoek's research lies in the fields of configuration management and software architecture, focusing on two research questions: (1) how to better coordinate the activities of multiple, geographically distributed developers and (2) how to better leverage higher levels of abstraction in designing and implementing software systems.</p>
<p>Van der Hoek also explores how simulation can aid students in learning more about the software engineering process.</p>

<p>Informatics professor <strong>Susan Elliott Sim</strong> has been awarded the <a href="http://www.ags.uci.edu/">Associated Graduate Students (AGS)</a> 2nd Annual Mentoring Award in the non-tenured category.</p>
<p>AGS sponsors this annual award as a way to recognize faculty mentors who inspire and guide their students, and whose dedication to graduate students and commitment to excellence have made significant contributions to both the professional development and quality of life for their students.</p>
<p>All graduate students and recent alumni can nominate faculty for this award by submitting a nomination form. This gives graduate students an opportunity to recognize a faculty member who goes &#8220;above and beyond&#8221; for his or her students. </p>
<p>Two awards are given each year, one to a tenured faculty member, and one to a non-tenured faculty member.</p>
<p>The winners in both categories are determined by a committee of graduate students and faculty from across campus, and all nominees are awarded a certificate and given the option to be recognized at the Graduate Commencement ceremony. </p>
<p>AGS is the recognized graduate student government association at the University of California, Irvine and represent nearly 5,000 graduate and professional students to the campus and system wide administration.</p>
<p>Sim's main area of research is program comprehension, in particular, tools and techniques that help software developers understand source code. Her primary research interest is the use of empirical methods to determine what are the right tools to build and whether the tools we have built help developers. </p>

</div>
<p>Professor of informatics <strong>Bill Tomlinson</strong> and Lindsey Richland, assistant professor of education have been awarded a $200,000 NSF CreativeIT grant.</p>
<p>This grant will support the dissertation research of Informatics doctoral student <strong>Eric Baumer</strong>, who contributed significantly to the grant. </p>
<p>The two year grant funds the project titled  "Computational Metaphor Identification for Supporting Creativity in Science Education" and will  focuse on analyzing the metaphors students use to understand and conceptualize material. </p>
<p>Identifying the metaphors that students use in their
			      learning has previously been labor intensive, requiring a great deal of time and attention from a human instructor. </p>
<p>The work will develop a suite of computational techniques to enable and standardize the process of metaphor identification. The result will be a technological tool kit that supports human creativity by automatically identifying metaphors in  bodies of text. </p>
<p>The tool kit will then be evaluated as a technology to foster creative learning in high school science students and combined with existing high quality, inquiry-based science instructional modules in the WISE system from UC Berkeley  (SAIL software) so that the metaphors that it extracts may be presented and incorporated with other learning processes. </p>
<p>Tomlinson's research deals with environmental issues in information technology ("Green IT"), multi-device human-computer interaction, computer supported learning, multi-agent systems, and real-time animation.</p>

<p><strong>Silvia Lindtner</strong>, a doctoral student in informatics and <strong>Gabriela Marcu</strong>, an undergraduate informatics major, have been selected as winners of the <a href="http://www.google.com/anitaborg/">Google Anita Borg Scholarship</a> for women in computing.</p>
<p>Each student will receive a $10,000 scholarship from Google, and will attend the 2008 Google Scholars' Retreat held in April where they will be joined by recipients of the Google United Negro College Fund and Google Hispanic College Fund scholarship programs. </p>
<p>The networking retreat will include workshops with a series of speakers, panelists, breakout sessions and social activities. </p>
<p>Lindtner, a Long Beach native, was part of a team within a Siemens Research lab that developed an interactive computer game, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/informatics/research/research_highlight_view.php?id=38">Fish 'N' Steps</a>, which links a player's daily footstep count to the growth and activity of animated fish.</p>
<p>Her team's idea was a twist on the Tamagotchi "digital pet" that created a sensation when manufacturer Bandai introduced it in 1996. The "health" and "happiness" of the handheld virtual creature depended on how well the user took care of it by responding to prompts for food, play and sanitation.</p>
<p>Marcu is a member of the first class of the new Informatics major in the Bren School and has helped spread the word about the new program by forming the <a href="http://spirit.dos.uci.edu/insa/">Informatics Student Association, (INSA)</a>. </p>
<p>She is  a member of the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/&#126;wics/">Women in Computer Science (WICS)</a> group at UCI which helps and encourages women to pursue a college degree and a successful career in the Computer Science fields. </p>
<p>Marcu also provides community outreach to local high schools and community colleges through the Bren School's Student Ambassador where she encourages students to pursue a career in the information and computer sciences field. </p>
<p>The scholarship is named in honor of Dr. Anita Borg (1949 - 2003), who devoted her adult life to revolutionizing the way we think about technology and dismantling barriers that keep women and minorities from entering computing and technology fields. </p>

                  Smyth</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Professor of computer science <strong>Padhraic Smyth </strong>has received a gift of $60,000 Google Research Award to support research on statistical text mining of very large document collections using parallel computing. </p>
<p>Statistical text mining is valuable in that it can discover underlying topics and trends that are otherwise hidden in  very large data sets, like  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/">PubMed</a>,  a public digital library<br/>
		        containing approximately 16 million research papers published in the biomedical literature. </p>
<p>Using existing algorithms would take several months of computer time to analyze the 16 million documents on a single computer - but the Smyth group has recently developed new techniques using multiple distributed processors that reduce the time for this analysis to about 1 day.</p>
<p>The Google Research Award will enable Professor Smyth and his research group to explore and develop newer and faster text mining algorithms, with potential applications in Web search, digital libraries, new types of browsers for<br/>
			      medical text data, and so on. </p>
<p>Other researchers involved in this work include Professor <strong>Max Welling</strong> and  <strong>Dave Newman</strong> (Computer Science), Professor  Mark Steyvers (Cognitive Sciences), and Computer Science Ph.D. students <strong>Arthur Asuncion</strong>, <strong>Chaitanya Chemudugunta</strong>, and <strong>America Holloway</strong>.</p>

                  </strong></p>
</div>
<p>Professor of informatics <strong>Gillian Hayes</strong> has received an $83,563 award from <a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/">Autism Speaks</a> for her proposal, "Technology Support for Interactive and Collaborative Visual Schedules".</p>
<p>Hayes work will focus on developing a digital repository and visual schedule system for use in schools and homes by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). </p>
<p>Using visual schedules, such as words, images and tangible objects to represent activities that will take place (or have taken place) has been shown to reduce the symptoms associated with autism.</p>
<p>The proposed system will be more than just a digital version of current visual scheduling techniques. </p>
<p>Part of the system design will leverage the current use of visual schedules by replacing them with both large, mounted and small, portable interactive touch screens.&#160; </p>
<p>This will enable caregivers and individuals with ASD to more quickly and easily interact with the schedules, marking when activities are completed and rearranging schedule items with streamlined, simple interactions.&#160; </p>
<p>The system will also enable new modes of interaction, including greater communication and collaboration amongst caregivers.&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>Using the smart visual schedules system, caregivers can generate reports, share information with one another, and possibly even update an individual schedule at a distance as circumstances change.</p>
<p>Autism Speaks is a New York City-based advocacy organization, founded in February 2005 by Bob Wright, Vice Chairman of General Electric, and his wife Suzanne, to improve public awareness about autism and to promote autism research. </p>
<p>The Wrights founded Autism Speaks to help find a cure for autism spectrum disorders a year after their grandson, Christian, was diagnosed with autism. </p>
