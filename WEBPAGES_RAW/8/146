<p><b>Abstract: </b>
An important aspect of hardware-software co-design is
partitioning of tasks to be scheduled on the hardware and
software resources. Existing approaches separate partitioning
and scheduling in two steps. Since partitioning solutions
affect scheduling results and vice versa, the existing
sequential approaches may lead to sub-optimal results.
In this paper, we present an integrated hardware/software
scheduling, partitioning and binding strategy. We use dynamic
programming techniques to devise an optimal solution
for partitioning of a given concurrent task graph, which
models the co-design problem, for execution on one software
(single CPU) and several hardware resources (multiple
FPGA's), with the objective of minimizing the total execution
time. Our implementation shows that we can solve
problem instances where the task graph has 40 nodes and
600 edges in less than a second.
