fix __str__ __repr__
iterable: see iter tools
  chain: *args, exhaust one move to next
  interleave: use one, move to next (skip if exhausted (maybe set to None)
  reverse: must get all in a structure
  sorted: must get all in a structure and sort it
  until/while: keep getting until a condition on the gotten value
  infinite: forever
  flattening: recursive on substructures
  groupby: get n at a time (use with flattening)

frange: floating range or fractionrange

for stacks, queues, etc. add_all(iterable)
  use pop/discard for these
  use __(len)
  overload getitem?
