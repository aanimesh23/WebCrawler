<H2>What is Tags?</H2>
Tags is a WWW interface generator for providing a non-technical view
of a process program, where the control flow of the process is hidden.
Tags webs are generated from a
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/Teamware/teamware.html">
Teamware Activity Network</A>.
A process programmer builds an Activity Network
by explicity identifying the steps, iterations, choices,
assignments, and workflow of a given process.  
Once the process is specified, the WWW interfaces can be 
generated.  With this information
an end-user can be guided through complex processes with a minimal 
amount of techical expertise.

<H2>How do I use it?</H2>
<P>
Using Tags is simple.  If you are a process programmer, you simply
edit a 
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/Teamware/teamware.html">
Teamware Activity Network</A> and then run the 'tags' tool.  Once the
pages are generated, you can edit the pages using an HTML Editor
(like 
<A HREF="http://www.ccs.org/htmledit/hotmetal.html>HoTMetaL</A> 
for instance) or add <A HREF="http://www.java.sun.com/">Java</A> 
applets to it (including communication to Teamware services). <BR>
If you are a end-user, simply start at the top level WWW page,
and let your mouse do the surfing.  At any page, you can check
off an activity as being completed, bring up tools as you need
them, download and use documents at the click of a link, and
refer to information that's relevant to accomplishing
your work. All pages have the toolbar
below, to allow you to 
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/Teamware/tags/example.html">
traverse the steps</A> and view your work within the context of the process.
