Wrappers typically    accomplish this by taking on the identity of the service    provider.</p></blockquote><h3>Also Known As</h3><blockquote>    <p><em>Other well-known names for the mechanism, if any. </em></p></blockquote><h3>Motivation</h3><blockquote>    <p><em>A scenario that illustrates a problem and how the    different elements of the mechanism solve the problem. The    scenario will help you understand the more abstract    description of the mechanism below. </em></p></blockquote><h3>Applicability</h3><blockquote>    <p><em>What are the situations in which the mechanism can be    applied? What are examples of poor designs that the mechansim    can address? How can you recognize these situations? </em></p>    <ul>        <li><em>An applicable situation </em></li>    </ul></blockquote><h3>Participants</h3><blockquote>    <p>The elements participating in the mechanism and their    responsibilities. </p>    <ul>        <li>Participant Name: Responsibility for what </li>    </ul></blockquote><h3>Collaborations</h3><blockquote>    <p>How the participants collaborate to carry out their    responsibilities. </p>    <ul>        <li>[Collaboration] </li>    </ul></blockquote><h3>Consequences</h3><blockquote>    <p><em>How does the mechanism support its objectives? What    are the trade-offs and results of using the pattern? What    aspect of system structure does it let you vary    independently? </em></p>    <ol>        <li><em>Description of consequence</em></li>    </ol></blockquote><h3>Implementation</h3><blockquote>    <p><em>What pitfalls, hints, or techniques should you be    aware of when implementing the mechanism? Are there    language-specific issues? </em></p>    <ol>        <li><em>Description of Bullet </em></li>    </ol></blockquote><h3>Known Uses</h3><blockquote>    <p><em>Examples of the mechanism found in real systems. Try    to include at least two examples from different domains. </em></p></blockquote><h3>Related Mechanisms</h3><blockquote>    <p>Wrappers are a particular type of component    intermediation. Wrappers are similar to the Decarator    software pattern.</p></blockquote><hr><p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~peymano/adaptation/"><em>Backto the Adaptation home page</em></a><em>.
