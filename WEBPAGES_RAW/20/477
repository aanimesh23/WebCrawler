"<b>A Compact Petri Net Representation for Concurrent Programs</b>"</A>,
by Matthew B. Dwyer, Lori A. Clarke and Kari A. Nies in Technical Report 94-046,
Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1994.

<H2> Abstract </H2>

This paper presents a compact Petri net representation that is efficient 
to construct for concurrent programs that use explicit tasking and 
rendezvous style communication. These Petri nets are based on task 
interaction graphs and are called TIG-based Petri nets. (TPNs).  They 
form a compact representation by abstracting large regions of program 
execution with associated summary information that is necessary for 
performing program analysis.  We present a flexible framework for checking 
a variety of properties of concurrent programs using the reachability 
graph generated from a TPN. We present experimental results that 
demonstrate the benefit of TPNs over alternate Petri net representations 
and discuss the applicability of Petri net reduction techniques to TPNS.
