"UCI is a technology-rich institution. IRUS has proven to be a
significant channel for technology inputs at Sun."<br>
<em>Dr. Thomas D. Arkwright, Java Architect</em><br>
<b>Sun Microsystems</b>

<p>
"The IRUS software engineering and computer science faculty at 
UC Irvine have shown a consistently high level of commitment to 
working closely with their industry partners. This is reflected in the 
selection of research topics that are relevant to the needs of indus
try, such as hypertext technology, software process support, and 
software testing. It is also reflected in the industry-relevant themes 
of the research colloquia that they organize, such as the California 
Software Symposium. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it is 
reflected in the ongoing, frequent informal interactions they wel
come and encourage from their industry partners." <br>
<em>Gregory F. Johnson, Principal Engineer</em> <br>
<b>Northrop Grumman Corporation</b>

<p>
"IRUS has provided a forum for Boeing to openly communicate 
with academia on topics relevant to its software process improve
ment needs. Boeing's participation in IRUS has also provided the 
opportunity to interact, coordinate and collaborate with other com
panies in the exchange of information, experiences, and ideas that 
are unique to the development of high quality software through 
process improvement."<br> 
<em>Paul Arnold, Senior Manager, Software Engineering Technology</em><br>
<b>The Boeing Company</b>

<p>
"Beckman is pleased to continue our sponsorship of the Irvine Research 
Unit in Software. Through a variety of events and forums IRUS provides

<b>Printronix, Inc.</b>

<p>
"The Southern California SPIN and other IRUS programs help FileNet 
engineering managers and staff stay current with the ever-changing 
"state of the practice" in the worldwide software industry. IRUS' collab
orative programs on object-oriented methods, testing, software quality 
assurance, process technology, reuse and metrics have helped us inte
grate new software technology into our engineering practices, which is 
essential if we are to continue to be a major player   in the dynamic
information technology markets of the 90's."<br>
<em>Bill Ball, Director, Software Quality Assurance and Support</em><br>
<b>FileNet Corporation</b>
