<FONT  SIZE=4>Computer programmers write instructions for
a living.  But programming languages are simple and unambiguous, and computer
processors interpret them more reliably than human beings interpret natural
language instructions.  Writing instructions for human execution, then,
requires skills that programmers may not automatically possess.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4><B>This assignment:</B>  Build some object
using Tinkertoys, Lego, or some other system with more than one type of
component that can be combined in more than one way.  (Note that some small
Lego kits do have just one &quot;correct&quot; assembly; such kits would
not be suitable for this assignment.)  You must be able to bring to class
all the pieces necessary for assembling your object.  Your object should
consist of 20-30 pieces.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>Then, write a manual that explains how to
build your object.  On Wednesday, April 10, you will bring the individual
components of your object and three copies of your manual to section; then
some of your classmates will try to follow your manual to build your object.
 At the same time, you will be following someone else&#39;s manual, so you
will not be available to answer oral questions about your manual or your
object&mdash;your classmates&#39; success will depend entirely on your writing.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4>There is no required length for this manual;
take as much space as you need to get the job done, and no more.  Similar
assignments in the past have typically been four to five pages long.  The
focus of this assignment is prose, not pictures.  You must do your job without
any illustrations.  This also means that when you bring your components
to class, you must be sure not to bring them in a package that shows the
final product. </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Due dates:</B>  
<BR>
&bull; Wednesday, April 10&mdash;Bring to class the disassembled components of your object and
<I>three copies</I> of a good draft of your manual.  As noted above, you
will build each other&#39;s objects in class, which we expect will generate
suggestions for improvements to your manual.
<BR>
&bull; Tuesday, April 16&mdash;A final revision of your manual is due at the beginning of class.
 As always, all previous versions (including the three copies edited by
your classmates) should be included with your paper submission.  In this
case, you must also turn in your disassembled components along with your
manual.  It&#39;s a good idea to re-read the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/139w/requirements.html">Writing Assignment Requirements</A>
sheet before submitting each assignment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT  SIZE=4><B>Suggestions and hints:</B> You may find it helpful to start your manual
  with a list of the components, describing and defining them so you can refer
  to them later.  (Note how this mirrors the organization of many computer
  programs.) <BR>
  Some objects are best described in terms of modules, giving the instructions
  for assembling each module separately, then explaining how to assemble the
  modules into the whole object.  (Note again the close analogy with software!) <BR>
  Organizational guides to the reader, such as section headings and a table
  of contents, may also help the user of your manual follow the instructions
  more easily.  But include these only if they&#39;re truly helpful; anything
  can be overdone, and it&#39;s certainly possible to write a clear manual
  with paragraphs of prose and nothing more.  (Interestingly, students in
  most Humanities writing classes are forbidden from using organizational
  aids like these, on the rationale that they make the writing job too easy
  by letting the writer avoid coming up with clear prose to mark the transitions
  between parts of the document.)  </FONT></P>
<P><FONT  SIZE=4><B>What to do when you get to class with your manual and your components:</B></FONT></P>
<P>
  <FONT >The first rule of reading someone else&#39;s work
is to be both honest and kind.  You don&#39;t do the author any favors by
simply saying, &quot;Yeah, it looks okay.&quot;  Don&#39;t be hesitant to
say what you understood or what you didn&#39;t; just do it pleasantly, helpfully,
and professionally.</FONT></P>
<OL TYPE="1">
<LI>
  <FONT >Students should place their components and the three
copies of their manual at the front of the room.</FONT><font ><BR>
<BR>
</font></LI>
<LI>
  <FONT >Then each student should repeat the following three
times:</FONT><font ><BR>
<BR>
</font>
<OL TYPE="1">
  <LI>
    <FONT >Take another student&#39;s components and a copy of
      the manual.</FONT><font ><BR>

  <LI>
    <FONT >Following the manual&#39;s instructions, assemble
      the components.</FONT><font ><BR>
      <BR>
      </font>  </LI>
  <LI>
    <FONT >As you work, mark on your copy of the manual any questions
      that you wish it had answered, any assumptions that you had to make, or
      any other aspects that were not clear.</FONT><font ><BR>
      <BR>
      </font>  </LI>
  <LI>
    <FONT >When you&#39;re finished, write on your copy &quot;Assembled
      by&quot; and your name.</FONT><font ><BR>
      <BR>
      </font>  </LI>
  <LI>
    <FONT >Then find the author, show him or her your product,
      and let the author make notes on any discrepancies between your assembly
      and what the author intended.</FONT><font ><BR>
      <BR>

    <FONT >Finally, return the pieces and the manual to the front
      of the room (where the remaining copies of the manual are).</FONT></LI>
