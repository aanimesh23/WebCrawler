As part of the selection process for the Evolved Expendable Launch 
Vehicle (EELV) Program, sponsored and funded by the United States 
Air Force (USAF), the Boeing Company competed in the proposal to 
develop a family of launch vehicles for the Department of Defense. 
The request for proposal required the competing contractors to 
participate in a Software Development Capability Evaluation (SDCE).   
This presentation provides an overview of the SDCE, its use by the 
USAF, the Boeing response process, and the USAF evaluation process.   
It gives the attendee insight into what occurred during the SDCE 
from both the customer and contractor perspectives. The attendee 
will discover what work is required from both sides in order to 
conduct an SDCE, the lessons learned from two SDCEs conducted a 
year apart, and results that surprised the customer and the contractor.
