Choose a closest pair application.
  g = greedy matching
  h = hierarchical clustering
  i = cheapest insertion tsp
  m = multifragment tsp

Use a minus sign (e.g. "-g") for maximization versions
Your choice: g

Choose a point set generation method.
  1 = points in R^d, L1 metric
  2 = points in R^d, (squared) L2 metric
  d = points in R^d, dot product
  i = points in R^d, L(inf) metric
  r = random distance matrix
  s = points in generalized Sierpinski tetrahedron
  t = two-adic non-archimedean metric
Your choice: 2
Dimension: 20

Choose a closest pair data structure.
  b = brute force
  c = conga line
