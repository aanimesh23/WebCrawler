<p>
<b>Download/Install/Test the CLion IDE</b>
<p>
<b>CLion</b> is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that uses the
  <b>Clang C++</b> compiler to develop/test C++ programs.
 It occupies about .6 GB on disk.
<p>
Before installing CLion in this handout, you should have already downloaded and
  installed the <a href="clang.html" targe="_new">Clang C++</a> compiler
  (if you haven't, go back and do so).
<p>
You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing CLion.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely, before performing the action that it
  describes.
<p>
This document shows the installation of CLion version 2016.2.2; I installed
  this version originally, but I am now using verson 2016.3.1.
You should install the latest version to be compatible with how CLion is
  used in this document.

    <p>
    The following splash should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion Splash.png">
    <p>
    Eventually CLion loads and the following <b>Welcome to CLion</b>
       pop-up window should appear on your screen (updated to the
       version you downloaded; this screen appears only the first
       time you start CLion).
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion Welcome.png">
    <p>

<li>Click the <b>New Project</b> button on this window.
    <p>
    The following <b>New Project</b>
      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion New CMake Project.png">
    <p>
    In the <b>Location</b> textbox, at the end of the path, replace
      <b>untititled</b> with <b>trivialtest</b>; leave the <b>C++ Executable</b>
      and <b>C++11</b> selected.
<p>

<li>Click the <b>OK</b> button on this window.
    <p>
    If a <b>Tip of the Day</b> pop-up window appears, click it <b>Close</b>
      button.
    <p>
    The following <b>CLion</b>
      project window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion Trivialtest.png">
    <p>
    Note that the right pane lists the tabs <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>
      (which contains the project's <b>make</b> code) and <b>main.cpp</b>
      (which is shown and contains a trivial C++ program).
    <p>
    In this window, I right-clicked in the gray area between the project and
      the <b>driver.cpp</b> panes and selected <b>Show Line Numbers</b>.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion ShowLineNumbers.png">
    <p>
    It useful to click the triangle to the left of <b>trivialtest</b> in the
      Project/left pane.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion Trivialtest disclosed.png">
    <p>
    Every project will contain a <b>cmake-build-debug</b> folder, which will
      ultimately contain the compiled code (executable) for the project.
    Later, we will see how to put data files in that folder; the executable
      uses that folder by default for reading/writing files.
    <p>

<!---
Don't need to set CMAKE_CXX_COMPOER or CMAKE_C_COMPILER

<li>Depress the <b>CLion</b> tab (to the right of the Apple logo on th top
      menu) and select <b>Preference</b> as shown in the
       following illustraton.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion Get to settings.png">
    <p>
    The following <b>Preferences</b>
      window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion Settings.jpg">
    <p>

<li>Undisclose the <b>Appearance & Behavior</b> item, disclose
      the <b>Build, Execution, Deployment</b> item, and select
      <b>CMake</b>.
    <p>
    The following <b>Preferences</b>
      window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion Settings CMake.jpg">
    <p>
    Copy and paste the text<br>
      <b>-D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/cygdrive/c/cygwin64/bin/clang++ -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=/cygdrive/c/cygwin64/bin/clang</b><br>
      into the <b>CMake Options</b> textbox.
    These CMake switches tells CLion that we will be using the Clang C++/C
      compilers.
    <p>
    The number #1 mistake that students make when creating
      <b>their own projects</b> is <b>forgetting to enter these CMake
      switches</b> heer or entering the wrong information.
    When having problems, always double check the CMake Settings.
    In projects that I supply, these switches will be correctly set in the
      <b>CMakeList.txt</b> file.
<p>

<li>Click the <b>OK</b> button on this window.
    <p>
    The following <b>CLion</b>
      project window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion reCMaking.jpg">
    <p>
    It hows CLion checking whether the CMake switches you entered are legal.
    <p>
    If you want to examine the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file, click on it (in
      the right pane).
    It will update the right pane to
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion CMakeLists.jpg">
    <p>
    If you do this, click on <b>main.cpp</b> (in the right pane), to return to
      the C++ program.
<p>
--->
<li>Click the <img src="images/clion/buildicon.jpg"> (Build icon) on this
      window.
    <p>
    The following <b>CLion</b>
      project window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion Built.png">
    <p>
    The results of the build appear in the <b>Message Build</b> pane.
    This <b>trivialtest</b> C++ program has now been compiled and linked
      successfully;
      either could have dispayed errors in the <b>Message Build</b> pane, which
      would have to be corrected before the program could be run.
    <p>
    <!--
    Because building was successful, the Run icon (
      <img src="images/clion/buildicon.jpg">) turned from Gray to Green
    -->
<p>
   
<li>Click the <img src="images/clion/runicon.jpg"> (Run icon) on this
      window.
    <p>
    The following <b>Edit Configuration</b>
      pop-up window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion Configuration.png">
    <p>
    For the <b>Target</b> dropdown, select <b>trivialtest</b> as shown.
    The <b>Executable</b> dropdown will change to <b>trivialtest</b> 
      automatically.

<li>Click the <img src="images/clion/CLion Run Button.png"> (<b>Run</b> button)
      on this window.
    <p>
    The following <b>CLion</b>
      project window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion Run.png">
    <p>
    The results of running the program print in the <b>Run</b> pane.
<p>

<li>To edit rebuild, and rerun the program, change the output string to
      <b>"Goodbye, World!"</b> and then click the
      <img src="images/clion/runicon.jpg"> (Run icon) again.
    CLion will rebuild the project (which contains no errors; you will briefly
      see the Message Build pane as shown above), and then rerun it.
    <p>
    The following <b>CLion</b>
      project window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion reRun.png">
    <p>
    The results of rerunning the program appear in the <b>Run</b> pane.
<p>

<li>If we create a syntax error (remove the <b>;</b> at the
      end of the <b>cout</b> line), CLion will highlight <b>endl</b> (the last
      token before the error), show a red squiggle under the error, and put a
      purple an underline at the right end of that column in the
      <b>main.cpp</b> pane (by hovering over it, an error message appears);
      CLion will also put a white <b>!</b> surrounded by a red circle at the
      end of the top line in the <b>main.cpp</b> pane.
    <p>
    The following <b>CLion</b>
      project window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion reRun syntax error 1.png">
    <p>
    To try to rebuild and rerun this code (it will fail), click the
      <img src="images/clion/runicon.jpg"> (Run icon) again.
    <p>
    The following <b>CLion</b>
      project window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion reRun syntax error 2.png">
    <p>
    The failed results of attempting to rebuild the program appear in the
      <b>Messages Build</b> pane; here I have repositioned the
      separation between the <b>mail.cpp</b> and <b>Message Build</b> panes
      to show the entire program and all the errors allow all errors to appear.
</ol>
We will now continue by learning how to download a CLion project and run it.
During the quarter, you will be asked to do this for all programming
  assignments and many quizzes.
<p>

<hr align="left" width="33%">
<h3>Section 3) Testing Downloadable CLion Projects with the Course Libraries</h3>
<p>
In this section you will learn more about CLion, by downloading the course
  libraries and then downloading/building/running a CLion project that contains
  various programs that use these libraries.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new shortcut and place it on your desktop in an easy to see
      position.
<ol type ="A">
   <li>In a <b>Terminal</b> window, copy/paste the following command
         <b>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES</b> and
         then execute it; terminate the <b>Terminal</b> window.
       To undo this command, copy/paste/execute
         <b>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO</b>.
   <li>Using the <b>Finder</b>,
       make an alias to the folder
         <b>Macintosh HD/Users/yourname/ClionProjects</b>
         and rename the alias <b>ClionProjects</b>.
</ol>
<p>

<li>Download and unzip the file <a href="libraries.zip">template</a>;
    Copy its three folders (<b>courselib</b>, <b>gtestlib</b>, and
      <b>test_all_data_types</b>) into the folder <b>ClionProjects</b>
      shortcuts; it should already contain the <b>trivialtest</b> folder,
      created by the operations above.
    <p>
    Generally, whenever you download CLion projects, you will unzip them and 
      then copy their folders into the folder that <b>ClionProjects</b>
      shortcuts.
<p>
  
<li>Click the <b>File</b> tab near the upper-left corner of the CLion toolbar;
      then click the <b>Open</b> option in the pull-down menu.
    <p>
    The following  pop-up window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion Open.png">
    <p>
    You may need to scroll this window to select the <b>CLionProjects</b> folder
      to make it appear as shown above.
    The <b>Users</b> folder should contain a folder with your name
      (<b>richardepattis</b> for me); it should contain a folder with the
      <b>ClionProjects</b> folder; it should contain the four folders
      <b>courselib</b>, <b>gtestlib</b>, <b>test_all_data_types</b>,
      and <b>trivialtest</b>.
    <p>
    Click on the <b>test_all_data_types</b> folder, so that it is highlighted.
<p>

<li>Click the <b>OK</b> button on this window.
    <p>
    The following <b>Open Project</b> window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion This Window.png">
    <p>

<li>Click the <b>This Window</b> button on this window.
    (clicking <b>New Window</b> creates a second project window, which
      is sometimes useful)
    <p>
    The following <b>CLion</b>
      project window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion TADT.png">
    <p>
<!---
    In this window, I right-clicked in the gray area between the project and
      the <b>driver.cpp</b> panes and select <b>Show Line Numbers</b>.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion ShowLineNumbers.jpg">
    <p>
--->

<li>Scroll downward, select lines 30-35, and press <b>command-/</b>,
      which uncomments the chosen lines.
    <p>
    The following <b>CLion</b>
      project window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion driver_set.png">
    <p>
    If you press <b>command-/</b></b> again, it will comment the lines; so
      this command really means <b>toggle-comment</b> on the selected lines.
    Before continuing ensure lines 30-35 are uncommented.
<p>

<li>Click the <img src="images/clion/runicon.jpg"> (Run icon) on this
      window.
    <p>
    The following <b>CLion</b>
      project window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion driver_set run.png">
    <p>
    First it will show the <b>Message Build</b> pane; it should be successful,
      so it should next show the <b>Run</b> pane.
    <p>
    Experiment with this driver by entering commands (and their arguments, when
      prompted) to better understand the <b>set</b> data type.
    You can enter the <b>q</b> command to terminate the driver, or you can
      click the <img src="images/clion/stopicon.jpg"> (Stop icon) on the
      left of the <b>Run</b> pane to terminate the driver.
    After terminating the driver, click the
      <img src="images/clion/closeicon.jpg"> (Close icon) left of the
      <b>Run</b> pane to close/remove the Run pane.
    <p>
    I suggest that you try terminating the driver with a <b>q</b> command; then,
      rerun the program and terminate it with the Stop icon.
<p>

<li>We briefly noted the <b>cmake-build-debug</b> folder; now we will examine
      it in more detail, but via an Finder window, not via CLion.
    Click on the <b>ClionProjects</b> shortcut to open a Finder window,
      then double-click its <b>test_all_data_types</b> folder, and finally
      double-click its <b>cmake-build-debug</b> folder.
    <p>
    The following Finder window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion Finder cmake-build-debug.png">
    <p>
    Whenever you create a project, a <b>cmake-build-debug</b> folder will
      appear in its project folder.
    We have built two projects in this handout: <b>test_all_data_types</b>
      and <b>trivialtest</b>; each has its own <b>cmake-build-debug</b> folder.
    <p>


<li>Double-click the file <b>test_all_data_types</b> to run this program
      in Windows, outside of CLion.
    The following <b>Terminal</b> window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion TerminalRun.png">
    <p>
    Experiment with this driver by entering commands (and their arguments, when
      prompted); it runs as it did in the CLion Run Pane.
    Note that when you enter the <b>q</b> command the program terminates and the
      <b>Terminal</b> window stops.
    For example, if you find the <b>trivialtest.exe</b> file and run it by
      double-clicking this file, its MS-DOS windo will run and then immediately
      disappear.
    <p>
    For a program that <b>produces lots of output</b> it is often faster to
        run the program in a <b>Terminal</b> window, rather than in CLion.
<p>

<li>Find the <b>input files</b> folder in the <b>test_all_data_types</b> folder
      and copy all of its <b>.txt</b> data files into the
      <b>cmake-build-debug</b> folder that contains the
      <b>test_all_data_types</b> file.
    <p>
    Then, run the program (either in the CLion Run pane or a <b>Terminal</b>
      window; try doing it in both places) and
      issue the <b>lf</b> command (load from file); when prompted for the file
      name, just press the <b>Enter</b> key to choose the default
      (<b>loadset.txt</b>).
    <p>
    When running using the CLion Run pane, the following <b>CLion</b>
      project window should appear on your screen.
    <p>

    <p>
    <b>IMPORTANT</b>: If a program reads data files, the root folder for the
         specifying the files is the folder in which the executable file
         appears.
       It is simplest to copy all the data files into this folder.
       An alternative would be to leave the files in the <b>input files</b>
         folder, copy the entire folder, and then refer to these file names like
         <b>input files/loadset.txt</b>.
<p>

<li>A typical project folder may have more than one <b>.cpp</b> file with a
     main function (as <b>test_all_data_types</b> has).
    Only one of these <b>.cpp</b> files can have its main function uncommented,
      otherwise the build will fail.
    When working on project, it is typical to 
    <p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Comment-out code in one <b>.cpp</b> file.
      <li>Uncomment code in another <b>.cpp</b> file.
      <li>Rebuild/Rerun the newly uncommented <b>.cpp</b> file.
    </ol>
    <p>
    In the <b>test_all_data_types</b> project folder, the <b>driver.cpp</b>
      file has many main functions: we uncommented one (in step 6) to allow us
      to run the Set driver.
    If more than one main function is uncommented, attempting to build the code
      will result in the compiler specifying a <b>redefinition of 'main'</b>
      error.
    <p>
    The <b>test_all_data_types</b> project folder also contains many <b>.cpp</b>
      files (their names all start with <b>test</b>) that each contain one main
      function (each is a <b>Googletest</b> for one data type).
    If more than one file contains a main function, attempting to build the
      code will result in the linker specifying a
      <b>multiple definition of 'main'</b> error.
    <p>
    To switch this project from running the Set driver to the Set Googletest
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Comment-out lines 30-35 in the <b>driver.cpp</b> file: select them
            and type the <b>command-/</b> command to toggle the commenting
            on the selected lines (comment them).
      <li>Scroll down the Project Pane (on the left) and double-click the
            <b>test_set.cpp</b> file so that it appears as an editor tab.
      <li>Type the <b>command-a</b> command to select <b>all</b> the lines in
            this file.
      <li>Type the <b>command-/</b> command to toggle the commenting on the
            selected lines (uncomment them).
    </ol>
    <p>
    Click the <img src="images/clion/runicon.jpg"> (Run icon).
    When prompted enter the three lines of information shown.
    <p>
    The following <b>CLion</b>
      project window should appear on your screen.
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion test_set run.png">
    <p>
    The bottom should show
    <p>
    <img src="images/clion/CLion test_set bottom.png">
    <p>
</ol>

We are now at the end of this handout.
You will not need to repeat the first two sections during the course, but you
  will frequently download project folders and use them as demonstrated in
  section 3.
