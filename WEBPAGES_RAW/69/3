<h1>SCRATCH: A Quick Description</h1>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<a name="SSpro"></a><h3>SSpro</h3>

<p>SSpro is a server for protein secondary structure prediction based on protein evolutionary
information (sequence homology) and homologous protein's secondary structure (structure homology).
For a detailed explanation of the methods, please refer to the references listed at the bottom
of this page. SSpro currently achieves a performance exceeding 79% correctly classified residues
on proteins with no homologs in the PDB and exceeding 92% correctly classified residues on proteins
where homologs can be found in the PDB, ranking on top of the tested prediction servers.</p>

<a name="SSpro8"></a><h3>SSpro8</h3>

<p>SSpro8 is an extension to SSpro. Instead of using three classes (helix, strand and the rest)
to assign the secondary structure of a protein, SSpro8 adopts the full DSSP 8-class output
classification:</p>
<ul>
<li>H: alpha-helix</li>
<li>G: 3-10-helix</li>
<li>I: pi-helix (extremely rare)</li>
<li>E: extended strand</li>
<li>B: beta-bridge</li>
<li>T: turn</li>
<li>S: bend</li>
<li>C: the rest</li>
</ul>
<p>For a detailed description of the tests performed on SSpro8, see the references. The overall
performance of the system currently online is approximately 67% correctly classified residues on
proteins with no homologs in the PDB and above 87% when homologs can be found in the PDB.
<b>NOTE</b>: SSpro8 is a completely different system from SSpro. Their results may not match.</p>

<a name="ABTMpro"></a><h3>ABTMpro</h3>

<p>ABTMpro is a server that predicts whether a given protein sequence is a transmembrane protein.  If the given protein sequence is a transmembrane protein, ABTMpro further predicts the probabilities of the protein being an alpha helical transmembrane protein or a Beta Barrel transmembrane protein. 
The prediction framework consists of a Support Vector Machine, which utilizes features such as amino acid composition and properties, reduced alphabet composition, predicted secondary structure, evolutionary information etc. 
The overall accuracy of ABTMpro is upwards of 97%, and achieves MCC values of 0.93 and 0.94 on smaller data sets and MCC values of 0.85 and 0.63 on much larger tests for alpha helical and beta barrel transmembrane proteins respectively.
</p>

<a name="CONpro"></a><h3>CONpro</h3>

<p>CONpro is a server that predicts whether the number of contacts of
each residue in a protein is above or below the average for that
residue. The prediction of CONpro is based on 1D-RNNs, adopting as
input a multiple alignment of homologues generated by PSI-BLAST.  The
threshold radius at which residues are considered in contact is at
12&Aring.  The accuracy of CONpro is 73%. The complete system is an
ensemble of 10 1D-RNNs.  For a more detailed explanation, see in the
references.</p>

<a name="ACCpro"></a><h3>ACCpro</h3>

<p>ACCpro is a server for the prediction of the relative solvent accessibility of protein residues.
The prediction of ACCpro is based on 1D-RNNs, adopting as input a multiple alignment of homologs
generated by PSI-BLAST.  Each residue in a protein is predicted as buried or exposed, i.e. more or
less accessible than a specified threshold. For the 25% threshold, the 'hard' case corresponding to
practically identical numbers of buried and exposed residues, ACCpro correctly classifies ~79% of
the residues and up to 90% when homologs exist in the PDB, better than any other system previously
described. For a more detailed explanation, see in the references.</p>
<br><a href="http://download.igb.uci.edu">Download ACCpro 5.2 (free for academic use)</a>

<a name="ACCpro20"></a><h3>ACCpro20</h3>

<p>ACCpro20 predicts the relative solvent accessiblity at all thresholds between 0% and 95%
at 5% increments. It is a 20-class variant of ACCpro predictor. Performance of the system
currently online is at the same level than ACCpro predictor in the hard case (25% accessibility
threshold), and higher for the other thresholds.</p>

<a name="DOMpro"></a><h3>DOMpro</h3>

<p>DOMpro predicts domain locations using a 1D-RNN. DOMpro takes an input
the sequence profile, predicted secondary structure, and predicted
relative solvent accessiblity.  The output of the 1D-RNN is a
classification for each residue as being in a domain boundary region
or not.  The domains are then infered from this output.
For a more detailed explanation, see the manuscript in references. </p>

<a name="DISpro"></a><h3>DISpro</h3>

<p>DISpro uses a 1D-RNN to predict the probablity that residues are
disorder.  The probabilities are also thresholded at probablity .5 to
make a hard classification.  The input to DISpro is the sequence
profile, predicted secondary structure, and predicted relative solvent
accesiblity.
For a more detailed explanation, see the manuscript in references. <br>

<a name="DIpro"></a><h3>DIpro</h3>

<p>DIpro is a cysteine disulfide bond predictor based on 2D recurrent
neural network, support vector machine, graph matching and regression
algorithms. It can predict if the sequence has disulfide bonds or not,
estimate the number of disulfide bonds, and predict the bonding state
of each cysteine and the bonded pairs. It yields the best accuracy on
the benchmark dataset Sp39. It can handle any number of disulfide
bonds where most of methods available so far only can handle less than
6 disulfide bonds. </p>

<p>Procedure: The seqeunce is processed in two steps. Step 1, use support
vector machine to classify if the sequence has disulfide bonds or
not. Step 2, use neural network and graph algorithm to predict the
number of bonds, bond pattern.
For a more detailed explanation, see in references. <br>

</p>

<a name="CMAPpro"></a><h3>CMAPpro</h3>

<p>CMAPpro is a server for the prediction of maps of contacts between protein residues.
The prediction of CMAPpro is based on ensembles of Deep Neural Networks, which take into
account the spatial dependencies of contact occurrences in local neighborhoods.
The input of the system consists of two-dimensional profiles extracted from multiple
alignments of homologues generated by PSI-BLAST, secondary structure and solvent
accessibility predictions obtained respectively from SSpro and ACCpro, and predicted
coarse contacts and orientations between secondary structure elements using two-dimensional
Recurrent Neural Networks. Maps at 8&Aring are available, meaning that two amino acids are
defined as being in contact if their C-&beta; atoms (C-&alpha; for glycines ) are closer than 8&Aring.
For a description of the tests performed on CMAPpro, see the references.</p>
<a name="SVMcon"></a><h3>SVMcon</h3>

<p>SVMcon predicts medium- to long-range residue-residue contacts using
Support Vector Machines. The contact predictions are in the CASP
format (residue index 1, residue index 2, 0, 8, contact probability).
The contact distance threshold is 8 angstrom. The sequence separation
between two residues is at least 6 residues. For information, see the references.<br><a href="http://www.bioinfotool.org/svmcon.html">Mirror Server</a>

<a name="3Dpro"></a><h3>3Dpro</h3>

<p>
3Dpro is a server that predicts protein tertiary structure. 3Dpro uses
predicted structural features, and PDB knowledge based statistical terms in
the energy function. The conformational search uses a move set consisting of
fragment replacement (using a fragment library built from the PDB) as well as
random perturbations to the model. Moves are selected or rejected based on a
simulated annealing method with linear cooling. Multiple models are
constructed using random seeds and the model with the lowest energy is
selected as the final prediction. 3Dpro is currently a de nuvo method
(structural templates are not used).
</p>

<p>The results of 3Dpro's performance at CASP6 can be found <a href="casp6_results.html">here</a>.</p>

<a name="SOLpro"></a><h3>SOLpro</h3>

<p>SOLpro predicts the propensity of a protein to be soluble upon
overexpression in <i>E. coli</i> using a two-stage SVM architecture
based on multiple representations of the primary sequence. Each
classifier of the first layer takes as input a distinct set of features
describing the sequence. A final SVM classifier summarizes the resulting
predictions and predicts if the protein is soluble or not as well as the
corresponding probability.</p>
<a href="http://download.igb.uci.edu">Download SOLpro (free for academic, non commercial, use).</a>

<a name="ANTIGENpro"></a><h3>ANTIGENpro</h3>

<p>ANTIGENpro is a sequence-based, alignment-free and pathogen-independant predictor
of protein antigenicity. The predictions are made by a two-stage architecture based
on multiple representations of the primary sequence and five machine learning algorithms.
A final SVM classifier summarizes the resulting predictions and predicts if the protein
is likely to be antigenic or not as well as the corresponding probability.
ANTIGENpro is the first predictor of the whole protein antigenicity trained using
reactivity data obtained by protein microarray analysis for five pathogens.</p>

<a name="VIRALpro"></a><h3>VIRALpro</h3>

<p>VIRALpro is a predictor capable of identifying capsid and tail protein sequences using
support vector machines (SVM) with an accuracy estimated to be between 90% and 97%. Predictions
are based on the protein amino acid composition, on the protein predicted secondary
structure, as predicted by SSpro, and on a boosted linear combination of HMM e-values
obtained from 3,380 HMMs built from multiple sequence alignments of specific fragments
- called contact fragments - of both capsid and tail sequences.</p>

 contact_map.12a. If the query is N amino acids long the files are composed of
 N lines, each containing N space-separated real numbers. The j-th number on
 line i-th represents the estimated probability that amino acids i and j are
 in contact (i.e. of their C-&alpha;s being closer than the threshold).</li>

<li>3Dpro: Prediction of tertiary structure:<br>
The predictions come in a separate email and contain a pdb file with the
coordinates of the C-&alpha atoms.</li>

SOLpro predicts if the protein is soluble or not (SOLUBLE/INSOLUBLE)
and gives the corresponding probability (&ge; 0.5).</li>

<li>VIRALpro: Prediction of capsid &amp; tail proteins:<br>VIRALpro predicts
if the input protein sequence is a capsid sequence or a tail sequence (YES/NO
for each). The absolute value of the corresponding score is the distance to the
decision boundary of the SVM and can be used for ranking purposes.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> Since CMAPpro and 3Dpro predictions are computationally intensive only
proteins of length at most 400 amino acids will be accepted if CMAPpro or
3Dpro predictions are selected.</p>
