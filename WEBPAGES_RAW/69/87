             </td></tr><tr><td><b>Abstract</b></td><td>Smartphones today support a large number of applications written by a
             diverse collection of third-party developers. How secure are the
             applications and the platforms that support them? What kinds of
             vulnerabilities exist, and how many phones are vulnerable today? To
             begin to answer this question, we examine data from the Device Analyzer
             project, a measurement platform which has collected information from
             over 30,000 Android phones around the world over the last five years. We
             find that, on average, 88% of devices were exposed to known
             privilege-escalation attacks which allow a malicious app to gain root on
             the device. We also quantify the risk of an alternative attack vector:
             the JavaScript-to-Java interface vulnerability. This vulnerability
             allows untrusted JavaScript running in a WebView to break out of the
             JavaScript sandbox, allowing remote code execution on Android phones.
             While this vulnerability was first reported in December 2012, we predict
             that the fix will not be deployed to 95% of devices until January 2018,
             over 5 years after the release of the fix. The talk finishes with some
             thoughts on why the security of smartphones is better than the above
             data might naively suggest, together with some approaches on how we
             might improve platform security further in the future.

             A cloud service provider with the lowest cost of service can either charge less or make a higher profit margin.  To keep costs low requires exploiting commodity hardware.  So the software task is not necessarily to provide the highest performance but rather to provide the best performance per dollar on this “cheap” hardware.  This requires efficient systems that are flexibly architected to run well on current commodity hardware and to be adapted easily to new commodity hardware as it evolves.  This talk will sketch the lessons we learned in the Deuteronomy record management project, with its successful use in Microsoft’s Hekaton main memory database system, Azure DocumentDB, and Bing Object Store.  We describe the Deuteronomy techniques that led to high efficiency and explain why they succeeded.

             </td></tr><tr><td><b>Abstract</b></td><td>
             Continuous queries allow subscribers to express their interest in
             events or topics, and be notified of matching events, generated by
             a publisher. Current continuous query systems implicitly assume
             that the queries are relatively static – for instance, Twitter or news
             followers – and are managed by a in-memory module. However, an
             increasing number of applications in this era of Big Data and Internet
             of Things (IoT) are based on a highly dynamic query paradigm,
             where continuous queries are in the millions and are created and
             expire in a rate comparable, or even higher, to that of the data entries.
             In this paper we propose several continuous query storage architectures,
             based on the popular NoSQL paradigm, to support high throughput
             and dynamic queries and data entries. Our methods
             naturally support queries on both past and future data, and generate
             instant notifications, which are desirable properties missing
             from many previous systems. We implemented and experimentally
             evaluated our methods on the popular LevelDB system, which uses
             LSM-based storage, using real datasets. Our results show that we
             can achieve significantly higher throughput compared to reasonable
             baselines.

             First part of this talk will discuss how the community is converging towards the IoT vision having worked in wireless sensor networking and Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication. This will follow a general discussion of security challenges in IoT. Finally I will discuss some results from my ongoing projects on security of bodywork devices and Secure IoT configuration management. Wireless bodyworn sensing devices are becoming popular for fitness, sports training and personalized healthcare applications. Securing the data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this talk, I will discuss a mechanism to secure data provenance and location proof for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching `link' fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for interesting security properties such as accountability and non-repudiation. I will present our solution with experiments using bodyworn devices in scenarios approximating actual device deployment. I will also touch upon other research on secure configuration management of IoT devices over wireless networks.

             This week's ISG Seminar speaker will actually be sharing a pair of talks with us.  Details follow!

             Talk #1: Immutability Changes Everything

             There is an inexorable trend towards storing and sending immutable data. We need immutability to coordinate at a distance and we can afford immutability, as storage gets cheaper.  This talk is simply an amuse-bouche on the repeated patterns of computing that leverage immutability. Climbing up and down the compute stack really does yield a sense of déjà vu all over again.

             Talk #2: Heisenberg Was on the Write Track

             Individual servers in a distributed system usually have pretty good responsiveness... except when they don't.  When they don't respond quickly, sometimes they can be very slow.  This can have a heck of an impact on the response time to write data when it needs to be recorded in multiple places.  In a distributed system, it turns out you can know where you write data or when you write data but you can't know both!

             Pat Helland has 37 years experience implementing databases, transaction systems, application platforms, replication systems, fault tolerance, and distributed systems. From 1973-1976, Pat attended UC Irvine in the ICS department, loved his ICS undergrad and grad classes, and lived non-stop at the computing facility as an operator on the PDP-10 and Xerox Sigma-7. This was back in the day when a computer was the size of a room and the only way to program was to stay up all night accessing the timesharing system. During the 1980s, Pat was Chief Architect of the Tandem NonStop's TMF (Transaction Monitoring Facility), the transaction processing and recovery engine behind NonStop SQL. He started working at Microsoft in 1994 and drove the design and architecture for MTS (Microsoft Transaction Server), the N-tier transactional computing environment for Windows as well DTC, the Distributed Transaction Coordinator. A few years later, Pat led the development of SQL Service Broker, a high speed exactly once transactional messaging system. From 2005 to early 2007, Pat worked at Amazon on the Product Catalog. In 2007, he returned to Microsoft working on a number of projects including adding indexing and affinitized placement of data into Cosmos, the massively parallel computation and storage engine behind Bing (Big Data). Cosmos supports exabytes of data running on hundreds of thousands of computers. He was one of the original architects for the real-time event driven transactional engine for Cosmos. Since early 2012, Pat has worked at Salesforce.com on database management, storage, and data center issues. He was recently added to the UCI ICS Inaugural Hall of Fame.

             Situation Recognition from Multimodal Data Streams
             </td></tr><tr><td><b>Abstract</b></td><td>
             The nature of data has significantly changed in the past decades. A large volume of spatio-temporal data has been produced, collected, and shared to observe events in the physical world at different spatial scales and temporal frequencies. A multitude of data streams such as weather patterns, stock prices, social media, traffic information, and disease incidents can be used to recognize evolving real-world situations. These situations vary and affect multiple aspects of people’s lives - such as traffic, flash floods, economic recession, and epidemic diseases. Detecting situations in time to take appropriate actions can help in saving lives and resources. Building upon a situation recognition and social network concept, where people can easily connect to people online, the Social Life Network (SLN) concept is introduced. The goal is to connect people with the right resources efficiently, effectively, and promptly, depending on the evolving situations. 

             In this talk, I will present a generic framework for situation recognition from multimodal data streams called EventShop. First, to ingest and store massive data streams, we implement the archival system using the pub/sub messaging system, Kafka, and big data management system, AsterixDB. Second, to handle data and events at different granularities, multi-resolution processing is introduced in every step including data ingestion, query processing, and data visualization. Finally, to fuse disparate data sources, a micro-reports concept is proposed. These micro-reports are compelling, universal, spontaneous, and objective. They can be used to solve problems of existing micro-blogs and replace them. The applicability of this framework is presented in a healthcare application for asthma risk management, disaster rescue for flood and hurricane mitigation, and smart city innovation.

             DeepMind’s AlphaGo employs deep learning and reinforcement learning to beat one of the best human Go players. At HTC, my team has been embarking on improving healthcare quality via artificial intelligence since 2012. In this talk, I will present three healthcare related initiatives: Tricorder, Healthbox, and VR/AR Health, and explain how artificial intelligence techniques play pivotal roles in improving diagnosis accuracy and treatment effectiveness. Specifically, this talk presents scalable algorithms of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and transfer learning to tackle both the big and small characteristics of healthcare data. The Healthbox and VR (virtual reality) initiatives were recently awarded several top prizes at 2016 CES and MWC, and the Tricorder project advanced to the final round of the Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE competition. My team has also launched via mobile app stores Medication Management and Symptom Checker, both of which are powered by crowd sourcing and data driven artificial intelligence.

             Edward Chang currently serves as the President of Research and Healthcare at HTC. Besides having developed and launched competitive camera features for flagship phones, Ed's most notable project is the Tricorder project, which he co-leads (with Prof. CK Peng at Harvard) a team of physicians, scientists, and engineers to design and develop mobile wireless diagnostic instruments that can help consumers make their own reliable health diagnoses anywhere at anytime. The project entered the Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE competition in 2013 with 311 other entrants and was selected as one of the seven finalists in August 2014 to advance to the final round (grand prizes to be announced in January 2017).  A subset of the developed technologies for Tricorder are used by HTC/Under Amour Healthbox, which won the best wearable award at CES.  

             Prior to his HTC post, Ed was a director of Google Research for 6.5 years, leading research and development in several areas including big data mining, indoor localization, social networking and search integration, and Web search (spam fighting). His contributions in parallel machine learning algorithms and big-data mining are recognized through several keynote invitations (see Stanford MMDS/ACM CIKM/ACM CIVR/ACM MM/AAIM/ADMA keynote deck and tutorial deck for details), and the developed open-source codes (PSVM, PLDA+, Parallel Spectral Clustering, and Parallel Frequent Pattern Mining) have been collectively downloaded over 10,000 times. His work on indoor localization with project X was deployed via Google Maps. Ed's team also developed the Google Q&amp;A system (codename Confucius), which was launched in 60+ countries including China,Russia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia, as well as 17 Arab and 40 African nations. Ed's book titled Foundations of Large-Scale Multimedia Information Management and Retrieval provides a good summary of his experience in applying big data techniques to feature extraction, learning, and indexing for organizing multimedia data to support both management and retrieval.

             </td></tr><tr><td><b>Abstract</b></td><td>
             With the spread of physical sensors and social sensors, we are living in a world of big 
             sensor data. Though they generate heterogeneous data, they often provide complementary 
             information. Combining these two types of sensors together enables sensor-enhanced social 
             media analysis which can lead to a better understanding of dynamically occurring situations. 
             We present two works that illustrate this general theme.

             In the first work, we utilize event related information detected from physical sensors 
             to filter and then mine the geo-located social media data, to obtain high-level semantic 
             information. Specifically, we have developed a unified matrix factorization based model 
             to fuse physical and social sensor signals for spatio-temporal analysis. We perform matrix 
             factorization on a spatio-temporal situation matrix formed from physical sensors signals, 
             incorporating the surrounding social content to exploit a set of latent topics that can 
             provide explanations for the concept signal strengths. We have tested our method on 
             large scale real data including PSI stations data, traffic CCTV camera images and tweets 
             for situation prediction as well as for filtering noise from events of diverse situations. 
             The experimental results show that the proposed matrix factorization approach is effective 
             in utilizing the sources correlation conducting better performances in various tasks. 


             Our second work combines photography knowledge learned from social media with the camera sensors 
             data to provide real-time photography assistance. Professional photographers use their knowledge 
             and exploit the current context to take high-quality photographs. However, it is often challenging 
             for an amateur user to do that. Social media and physical sensors provide us an opportunity to 
             improve the photo-taking experience for such users. In this work, we mainly focus on group photography 
             where the challenge for an amateur photographer is to determine the arrangement, size and position of 
             a group of people on the image frame. Visual balance is considered as one of the important factors 
             in defining the aesthetic quality of a captured photograph. We have developed a novel method to obtain 
             visual balance in a layout with dynamic visual elements. We use the idea of spring-electric graph 
             model and augment it with the concept of color energy from the visual arts. We utilize social media 
             images along with proposed spring-electric model for providing a recommendation to 
             the user. The proposed method can be used to provide real-time feedback to the user regarding 
             the arrangement of people, their position and relative size on the image frame.

             Streaming analytics is about identifying and responding to events happening in your business, in your service or application, and with your customers in near real-time. Sensors, mobile and IoT devices, social networks, and online transactions are all generating data that can be monitored constantly to enable a business to detect and then act on events and insights before they lose their value. The need for large scale, real-time stream processing of big data in motion is more evident than ever before but the potential remains largely untapped by most firms. It’s not the size but rather the speed at which this data must be processed that presents the greatest technical challenges. In this talk I will draw upon our experience with Amazon Kinesis data streaming services to highlight use cases, discuss technical challenges in scaling a data streaming service to massive scale, and look ahead to the future of stream data processing.

In this talk, we will present idIVM; a novel IVM system, which under the assumption that the base tables have keys, performs IVM by computing ID-based diff sets that compactly identify the to-be-modified tuples through their IDs. By exploiting base table IDs, idIVM is shown both analytically and experimentally to have superior performance than prior state of the art IVM algorithms in common use cases. The talk will start with a presentation of the idIVM system for the relational setting, as it has been presented in SIGMOD 2015, and continue with a discussion of our ongoing work on extending this approach to IVM of semistructured data.

The actions taken as a group do not violate any of the integrity constraints associated with the state. This requires that the transaction be a correct program.” Loosely translated, you should be happy with yourself. In your own opinion, you should be sane. Through the years, this most ill defined property of the ACID transaction has been conflated with isolation and interpreted through the prism of read/write updates to an apparently centralized record oriented database. This suits systems developers that need a narrow definition to feel they can accomplish something. Unfortunately, it leaves many real world problems in the dust. In this talk, we will explore the models of consistency and the facades of reality used in practical Systems.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td>Pat Helland has 37 years experience implementing databases, transaction systems, application platforms, replication systems, fault tolerance, and distributed systems.

SpatialHadoop injects spatial data awareness inside the core of Hadoop to make it orders of magnitude more efficient than plain-vanilla Hadoop. It adapts traditional spatial indexes, such as R-tree, Quad tree and K-d tree, to HDFS and uses these indexes to support a wide range of spatial operations, including, range query, kNN, spatial join, and computational geometry operations. In addition, it provides a high level language, termed Pigeon, which makes the system easier for non-technical users. Furthermore, SpatialHadoop has an extensible and scalable visualization layer that is able to produce giga-pixel images for terabytes of data, which allows users to explore big spatial data. The open source nature of SpatialHadoop allows it to be used in a wide range of research projects and live applications, including, SHAHED, for querying and visualizing satellite data, TAREEG, a web-based extractor for OpenStreetMap data, and TAGHREED, a system for querying and analyzing Twitter data.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td>Ahmed Eldawy is a sixth year PhD candidate at the Computer Science and Engineering department in University of Minnesota.

             The first talk will describe the BAD project, where BAD is short for Big Active Data. BAD is a joint effort between UCR and UCI. First-generation Big Data management projects like AsterixDB have been passive in nature - queries, updates, and data analysis techniques have been scaled to handle very large volumes of data. In contrast, the BAD effort aims to develop techniques to continuously and reliably capture Big Data collections (arising from social, mobile, Web, and sensed data sources) and to provide timely delivery of the right information to the relevant end users. In short, BAD aims to provide a scalable foundation for moving from Big Passive Data to Big Active Data. Techniques are being developed to enable the accumulation and monitoring of petabytes of data of potential interest to millions of end users; when "interesting" new data appears, it should be delivered to end users in a time frame measured in (100's of) milliseconds. The NSF-sponsored BAD project has been underway for just one year, and it will eventually lead to a series of BAD results, BAD papers, and BAD open source software.
             The second talk will describe a brand new UCI project, sponsored by DARPA, called TIPPERS.

However, it has not supported range operations, only individual record operations (e.g., create, read, update, delete).  In this paper, we enhance our multi-version timestamp order technique to handle range concurrency and prevent phantoms. Importantly, we maintain high performance while respecting the clean separation of duties required by Deuteronomy, where a transaction component performs purely logical concurrency control (including range support), while a data component performs data storage and management duties. Our range technique continues to manage concurrency information in a latch-free manner.  With our range enhancement, Deuteronomy can reach scan speeds of nearly 250 million records/s (more than 27 GB/s) on modern hardware, while providing serializable isolation complete with phantom prevention.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td>David Lomet founded and  manages the Database Group at Microsoft Research Redmond.

             diverse domains, for developing techniques able to index and mine very
             large collections of sequences, or data series. Examples of such
             applications come from the Inernet of Things, biology, astronomy,
             entomology, the web, and other domains. It is not unusual for these
             applications to involve numbers of data series in the order of hundreds
             of millions to billions, which are often times not analyzed in their
             full detail due to their sheer size.
             In this talk, we describe recent efforts in designing techniques for
             indexing and mining truly massive collections of data series that will
             enable scientists to easily analyze their data. We show that the main
             bottleneck in mining such massive datasets is the time taken to build
             the index, and we thus introduce solutions to this problem. Furthermore,
             we discuss novel techniques that adaptively create data series indexes,
             allowing users to correctly answer queries before the indexing task is
             finished. We also show how our methods allow mining on datasets that
             would otherwise be completely untenable, including the first published
             experiments using one billion data series.
             Finally, we present our vision for the future in big sequence management

In the meantime,  in real-world applications, it is highly desirable to reduce the tedious, inefficient ETL (extraction, transformation, and loading) gap between tabular data processing systems and graph processing systems. Unfortunately, those challenges have not been easily met due to the intense memory pressure imposed by process-centric, message passing designs that many graph processing systems follow, as well as the separation of tabular data processing runtimes and graph processing runtimes.
             
             In this thesis, we first propose a bloat-aware design paradigm towards the development of efficient and scalable Big Data applications in object-oriented, GC enabled languages and demonstrate that programming under this paradigm does not incur significant programming burden but obtains remarkable performance gains (e.g., 2x). Based on the design paradigm, we then build Pregelix, an open source distributed graph processing system which is based on an iterative dataflow design that is better tuned to handle both in-memory and out-of-core workloads. As such, Pregelix offers improved performance characteristics and scaling properties over current open source systems (e.g., we have seen up to 15x speedup compared to Apache Giraph and up to 35x speedup compared to distributed GraphLab). Finally, we integrate Pregelix with the open source Big Data management system AsterixDB to offer users a mix of a vertex-oriented programming model and a declarative query language for richer forms of Big Graph analytics with reduced ETL pains.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td>

             important to a wide array of enterprise applications, ranging from
             Business Intelligence and Semantic Search to Data-as-a-Service. Such
             applications drive four main requirements for IE systems: accuracy,
             embeddability, scalability, transparency, and usability. In this talk
             I will give an overview of SystemT, a declarative IE system designed
             to address these requirements. SystemT ships today with multiple
             products across 4 IBM Software Brands and is used in multiple ongoing
             research projects.
             
             SystemT is based on the basic principle underlying relational database
             technology: complete separation of specification from execution.
             SystemT uses a declarative rule language, AQL, and an optimizer that
             generates high-performance algebraic execution plans for AQL rules. We
             show that SystemT removes the expressivity and performance limitations
             of previous state-of-art rule-based systems based on cascading
             grammars, delivering comparable result quality, and an order of
             magnitude higher annotation throughput with much lower memory
             footprint. We also present the ongoing research and development
             efforts in making SystemT more usable for both technical and business
             users.

Both technical and non-technical issues have continued to fuel the rapid pace of developments in the Big Data space. Open source and non-traditional software entities have played key roles in the latter. As it always happens with any emerging technology, there is a fair amount of hype that accompanies the work being done in the name of Big Data. The set of clear-cut distinctions that were made initially between Big Data systems and traditional database management systems are being blurred as the needs of the broader set  of (“real world”) users and developers have come into sharper focus in the last couple of years.

              users to formulate a query that can be properly processed by the existing
              systems.  We argue that for a user-friendly graph query engine, it must
              support various kinds of transformations such as synonym, abbreviation, and

         mitigates the complexity of accessing graph data. It provides simple and
         intuitive query interfaces, including a schema-less query engine for

             and store them for a long time.
             This opens the possibility that kinds of demanding analysis like forecasting, formerly dependent on
             data warehouses and temporal databases, can become available to everyday applications in off-the-shelf data stores. The challenge is how to organize past states so that they are ``not in the way'' and ``always there'' when needed.
             
             Our  approach, called Retro, integrates a low-level consistent snapshot system into a data store
             storage manager, allowing to run unmodified data store programs against the snapshots, 
             side by side with programs running against the current state. The approach is attractive for several reasons.
             An application can take snapshots efficiently with any frequency, keep them indefinitely,
             or garbage-collect them at low cost, a useful feature in long-lived systems. 
             A principled methodology derives the snapshot protocols from the native data store storage manager mechanisms, allowing to implement the snapshot system in a modular way,
             without extensive modifications to the data store internals, making the approach suitable in off-the-shelf data 
             stores.
             The talk will describe the new techniques that underly Retro
             and present preliminary performance results from a prototype we built in Berkeley DB, indicating Retro
             is efficient, imposing moderate performance penalty on the native data store, on expected common workloads. </td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td>Liuba Shrira is a Professor in the Computer Science Department at Brandeis University,

             engines, and transactional databases are built. Such services are trusted with
             irreplaceable personal and commercial information by users, companies, and even governments.
             The designers of storage services often have to choose between performance and reliability. If the developer
             makes the system reliable, performance is often significantly reduced. If the developer instead maximizes
             performance, a crash could lead to data loss and corruption.
             In this talk, I describe how to build systems that achieve both strong reliability and high performance. In many
             systems, reliability is maintained by carefully ordering updates to storage. The key insight is that the low-level
             mechanism used to enforce ordering is overloaded: it provides durability as well as ordering. I introduce a new
             primitive, osync(), that decouples ordering from durability of writes. I present Optimistic Crash Consistency,
             a new crash-recovery protocol that builds on osync() to provide strong reliability guarantees and high
             performance. I implement these techniques in the Optimistic File System (OptFS) and show that it provides
             10X increased performance for some workloads. With researchers in Microsoft, I employ the principles of
             Optimistic Crash Consistency in a distributed storage system, resulting in 2-5X performance improvements.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td>Vijay Chidambaram is a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of

Data feeds are a mechanism for having continuous data arrive into a BDMS from external sources and incrementally populate a persisted dataset and associated indexes. The need to persist and index "fast-flowing'' high-velocity data (and support ad hoc analytical queries) is ubiquitous. However, the state of the art today involves 'gluing' together different systems. AsterixDB is different in being a unified system with "native support'' for data  ingestion.
             
             We discuss the challenges and present the design and implementation of the concepts involved in modeling and managing data feeds in AsterixDB. AsterixDB allows the runtime behavior, allocation of resources, and the offered degree of robustness to be customized (by associating an ingestion policy) to suit the application(s) that wish to consume the ingested data. Results from  experiments that evaluate the scalability and fault-tolerance of the AsterixDB data feeds facility are reported. We include an evaluation of the built-in ingestion policies and study their effect as well on throughput and latency. An evaluation and comparison with a `glued' together system formed from popular engines - Storm (for streaming) and MongoDB (for persistence) - is also included.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td></td></tr></table></div><div style="height: 5px;"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="eventDate">Feb. 27, 2015</div></td><td><div class="eventInfor">SPEAKER: Fatma Ozcan (IBM Research - Almaden)</div><div class="eventInfor">SQL Comes Back, But This is not Your Father's DBMS!</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><a href="#" onclick='var x=getElementById("e99300");if(x.style.display!="none"){x.style.display="none";}else{x.style.display="block";}return false;'>Details</a></td></tr><tr class="detr"><td colspan="2"><div id="e99300" style="display:none;border:solid grey;border-width:1px;"><table><tr><td style="width:100px;"><b>Date and Time</b></td><td>Feb. 27, 2015 3 pm</td></tr><tr><td><b>Location</b></td><td>DBH 3011</td></tr></table><br></br><table><tr><td style="width:100px;"><b>Speaker</b></td><td>Fatma Ozcan (IBM Research - Almaden)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Title</b></td><td>SQL Comes Back, But This is not Your Father's DBMS!</td></tr><tr><td><b>Abstract</b></td><td>Recent years have seen the resurgence of SQL; this time in the context of Big Data Platforms.

             are significant differences between the new incarnation of SQL systems, and the traditional enterprise
             warehouses. First, semi-structured data is inherent in the Hadoop data as the data frequently
             comes from noSQL and web sources. Hence JSON data and complex types are more important than in 
             traditional systems. Second, SQL is only one of the steps in the bigger analytical flows. This requires
             SQL to interact with other frameworks, including streaming, ETL, as well as advanced analytics and

They now drive towards declarative, SQL-alike query languages. However, their idiomatic, non-SQL language constructs, the many variations and the lack of formal syntax and semantics pose problems. Notably, database vendors end up with unclear semantics and complicated implementations, as they add one feature at-a-time.
             
             The presented SQL++ semi-structured data model bridges JSON and the SQL data model. The SQL++ query language is backwards compatible with SQL, while supporting native JSON. SQL++ includes configuration options that describe different options of language semantics and formally capture the variations of existing database languages. SQL++ is unifying: By appropriate choices of configuration options, the SQL++ semantics can morph into the semantics of any of eleven popular semistructured databases, which we surveyed, as the experimental validation shows. In this way, SQL++ allows a formal characterization of the capabilities of the emerging query languages.

In contrast to traditional relational databases, the LOD cloud does not provide a fixed, pre-defined schema. Rather, RDF allows for flexibly modeling the data schema by attaching RDF types to the entities and by using domain-specific RDF properties to describe the entities. The talk presents recent developments on the extraction and analysis of schema information from the LOD cloud. For example, with SchemEX, we have developed an efficient approach and tool for a stream-based extraction and indexing of schema information from Linked Open Data (LOD) at web-scale. The schema index provided by SchemEX can be used to locate distributed data sources in the LOD cloud. The SchemEX approach is used in LODatio, a Google-inspired search engine designed for data engineers to find relevant sources of LOD. Further analysis of schema structures on the LOD cloud include investigating the redundancy between type and property information, use of vocabularies in pay-level domains, and change of schema information over weekly snapshots of a larger amount of LOD data. The talk will conclude with current developments and future work.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td>Ansgar Scherp is a professor at the Leibniz Information Center for Economics and Kiel University, Kiel, Germany</td></tr></table></div><div style="height: 5px;"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="eventDate">Jan. 30, 2015</div></td><td><div class="eventInfor">SPEAKER: Chris Jermaine (Rice University)</div><div class="eventInfor">Large-Scale Machine Learning with the SimSQL System</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><a href="#" onclick='var x=getElementById("e99295");if(x.style.display!="none"){x.style.display="none";}else{x.style.display="block";}return false;'>Details</a></td></tr><tr class="detr"><td colspan="2"><div id="e99295" style="display:none;border:solid grey;border-width:1px;"><table><tr><td style="width:100px;"><b>Date and Time</b></td><td>Jan. 30, 2015 3 pm</td></tr><tr><td><b>Location</b></td><td>DBH 3011</td></tr></table><br></br><table><tr><td style="width:100px;"><b>Speaker</b></td><td>Chris Jermaine (Rice University)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Title</b></td><td>Large-Scale Machine Learning with the SimSQL System</td></tr><tr><td><b>Abstract</b></td><td>In this talk, I'll describe the SimSQL system, which is a platform for writing and executing statistical codes over large data sets, particularly for machine learning applications. Codes that run on SimSQL can be written in a very high-level, declarative language called Buds. A Buds program looks a lot like a mathematical specification of an algorithm, and statistical codes written in Buds are often just a few lines long.
             
             At its heart, SimSQL is really a relational database system, and like other relational systems, SimSQL is designed to support data independence. That is, a single declarative code for a particular statistical inference problem can be used regardless of data set size, compute hardware, and physical data storage and distribution across machines. One concern is that a platform supporting data independence will not perform well. But we've done extensive experimentation, and have found that SimSQL performs as well as other competitive platforms that support writing and executing machine learning codes for large data sets.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td>Chris Jermaine is an associate professor of computer science at Rice University.

information retrieval. However, when researchers can only access
publicly-visible data, one quickly finds that social media users
rarely publish location information. In this work, we provide a method
which can geolocate the overwhelming majority of active Twitter users,
independent of their location sharing preferences, using only
publicly-visible Twitter data.

Our method infers an unknown user's location by examining their
friend's locations. We frame the geotagging problem as an optimization
over a social network with a total variation-based objective and
provide a scalable and distributed algorithm for its solution.
Furthermore, we show how a robust estimate of the geographic
dispersion of each user's ego network can be used as a per-user
accuracy measure, allowing us to discard poor location inferences and
control the overall error of our approach.

Leave-many-out evaluation shows that our method is able to infer
location for 101,846,236 Twitter users at a median error of 6.38 km,
allowing us to geotag over 80% of public tweets.

related to real life events.  For this reason,  although still being a challenging task, the development of 
effective methods to retrieve these pictures is important. Recognizing this importance, and to improve 
the retrieval effectiveness of tag-based event retrieval systems, we have proposed a new 
effective method to extract a set of geographical tag features from raw geo-spatial profiles of user tags.  
The main idea is to use these features to select the best expansion terms in a machine learning-based
query expansion approach. Specifically, we apply rigorous statistical exploratory analysis of spatial 
point patterns to extract the geo-spatial features. Then, we used the features both to summarize the spatial 
characteristics of the spatial distribution of a single term, and to determine the similarity between 
the spatial profiles of two terms -- i.e., term-to-term spatial similarity. To further improve our image retrieval 
approach, we investigated the effect of combining our geo-spatial features with temporal features. 
In this presentation, I will try to give an overview of the methods we used
(1) to extract the spatio-temporal featrues from image tags, and (2) how to use these features to
improve the retrieval performance, focusing on retrieval of event-related images. Finally, I will
discuss the results from our experiments, and show how our method has improved the

Its revolutionary potential is now universally recognized. Data complexity, heterogeneity, scale, and timeliness make data analysis a clear bottleneck in many biomedical applications, due to the complexity of the patterns and lack of scalability of the underlying algorithms. Advanced machine learning and data mining algorithms are being developed to address one or more challenges listed above. It is typical that the complexity of potential patterns may grow exponentially with respect to the data complexity, and so is the size of the pattern space. To avoid an exhaustive search through the pattern space, machine learning and data mining algorithms usually employ a greedy approach to search for a local optimum in the solution space, or use a branch-and-bound approach to seek optimal solutions, and consequently, are often implemented as iterative or recursive procedures. To improve efficiency, these algorithms often exploit the dependencies between potential patterns to maximize in-memory computation and/or leverage special hardware for acceleration. In this talk, I will present some open challenges faced by data scientist in biomedical fields and our approaches to tackle these challenges through examples such as multi-locus QTL analysis and transcriptome quantification using RNAseq data.

In the past several years, the lab has developed a variety of open-source software (e.g., Spark and MLBase) to integrate the three resources. For the People part, one of our main focuses is on data cleaning. Real-world data is often “dirty”. Data cleaning is usually a tedious and time-consuming process which requires a lot of human work. In the AMPLab, we have exploited the use of crowdsourcing to reduce the human cost. While crowdsourcing makes data cleaning more scalable, it is still highly inefficient for large datasets. To overcome this limitation, we started the SampleClean project last year. The project aims to investigate how to obtain accurate query results from dirty data, by only cleaning a small sample of the data. We achieved this goal by marrying data cleaning with sampling-based approximate query processing, and addressing many challenging statistical issues. We build a new system that combines our work on crowdsourcing data cleaning and SampleClean query processing. An initial version of the system has shown that our system can help users to obtain very accurate query results on dirty data, at significantly reduced cleaning cost.

simple or small data operations).  It is motivated by the flurry of novel data
store designs ranging from SQL to NoSQL and NewSQL, Cache Augmented SQL, graph
databases and others.  More than 40 data stores have been introduced in the past
decade including systems contributed by the social networking sites,
e.g., Cassandra by Facebook and Voldemort by LinkedIn.  Some systems sacrifice
strict ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties and opt
for BASE (Basically Available, Soft-state, Eventual Consistency) to enhance
performance.  BG strives to compare these systems with one another quantitatively.

This  presentation details the design of BG and its SoAR metric to rate data stores.
We describe how BG quantifies the amount of unpredictable (stale, erroneous, or inconsistent)
data produced by a data store.  We present ratings from an industrial strength relational
database management system, a document store named MongoDB, a graph data store named
Neo4j, and an extensible data store named HBase.  We show the use of SoAR to evaluate
both vertical and horizontal scalability of MongoDB and HBase.  We also describe
the use of BG to evaluate novel cache replacement algorithms such as CAMP and
consistency frameworks such as IQ.  We conclude with the use of BG to demonstrate
a novel SQL middleware named KOSAR.

In prior work we implemented both a TC and DC that achieved modest performance. We recently built a high performance DC (the Bw-tree key value store) that achieves very high performance on modern hardware via latch-free and log structuring techniques and is currently shipping as an indexing and storage layer in Microsoft systems such as Hekaton and DocumentDB. The new DC executes operations more than 100x faster than the TC we previously implemented.  This talk describes how we achieved two orders of magnitude speedup in TC performance and shows that a full Deuteronomy stack can achieve very high performance overall. We built the TC using techniques analogous to the Bw-tree (latch-free data structures, log-structuring). The TC uses multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) to improve concurrency and performance.  Our new prototype TC scales to 32 cores on our 4 socket NUMA machine and commits more than a million of transactions per second for a variety of workloads.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td>David Lomet has been a principal researcher and manager of the Database Group at Microsoft Research, Redmond since 1995.

Thanks to the explosion of Electronic Heart Records (EHR), the interest in building predictive models based on EHR data has skyrocketed in recent years.  There are some major challenges that remain to be addressed.  In this talk I will explore two of them. Effective algorithms are lacking in dealing with high-dimensional, longitudinal, sparse, inaccurate and inconsistent EHR data. The methodologies to develop predictive models are still labor intensive and ad-hoc. These rudimentary approaches are hindering the quality and throughput of healthcare and biomedical research.
In this talk, we promote a holistic approach that addresses both challenges by combining 1) algorithm development and 2) system building. We believe that a more robust and domain specific big-data platform could significantly speedup the development of robust and accurate predictive models for biomedical research. 
I will present different projects covering both aspects of such a platform:
Algorithms: I will first describe our work on computational phenotyping from EHR data using sparse tensor factorization; then I will present a patient similarity method using supervised distance metric learning
System: I will introduce a parallel predictive modeling platform using Hadoop for enabling large scale modeling and exploration of big healthcare data</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td>Jimeng Sun is an Associate Professor of School of Computational Science and Engineering at College of Computing in Georgia Institute of Technology.

Each new development seems to be subject to exuberant hyperbole.  The latest round is focusing on embedded electronics and is called The
Internet of Things, or just "The IoT."  The main force powering this "hype machine" is the suggestion of vast new commercial opportunities, estimated by some sources to be in the range of $19 Trillion. This talk begins with the conclusion that the "hype" about The Internet of Things is underplayed, and that the commercial implications of The Internet of Things are the smallest parts of a bigger story.  It compares The IoT to other historical technological developments, examining what is similar, and what is without historical precedent.  In particular, it finds the impact of applications of The Internet of Things to be spectacularly unconstrained.  All this leads to the idiom "Careful what you wish for."  So, while commerce is "wishing for" a $19 Trillion market, our society, and our economy, are going to get something else. The talk concludes with an examination of some of the potential unintended consequences of The Internet of Things.  It predicts that areas as diverse as Brand Management, Advertising, Propaganda, Healthcare, Law Enforcement, Insurance, Automobile ownership, Politics, and Warfare, to name just a few, will all be affected in ways few are considering.

Storage of this data and its subsequent analysis have posed significant challenges. Unlike the business data that drove research and development of relational databases for the past several decades, Web and Social data tend to have rich and varying structure, making traditional database systems a poor choice for their management. The astronomical size and semi-structured nature of this new data has forced companies in the business of managing it to look for other cost-effective solutions. In 2004 Google presented the MapReduce system as a way to harness the power of thousands of commodity machines to solve problems like building a search index over the entire World Wide Web in reasonable time at reasonable cost; MapReduce turned out to be a useful tool for performing other parallel computations over large amounts of data while presenting a simple programming model to users. Soon after the MapReduce paper, the open source community created the Hadoop platform to resemble Google's MapReduce system. Hadoop soon became a popular platform for processing large amounts of data using commodity computers. In an effort to boost user productivity, new declarative languages were designed and built to compile high-level declarative queries down to Hadoop MapReduce programs, making Hadoop the de-facto runtime layer for large-scale parallel data computation.

While widely used and popular today, Hadoop was not intentionally designed to be a runtime layer for higher-level declarative languages.
In this talk we explore an alternative to the Hadoop platform whose design is rooted in parallel database research from the 1980s and 1990s. Hyracks is an efficient runtime platform that accepts data-parallel jobs from users and from high-level language compilers and executes them on a cluster of commodity machines. We describe the design of Hyracks as well as salient aspects of its implementation. Using Hyracks we study the trade offs involved in building an extensible and reusable set of runtime components for large-scale data processing. We show experimentally that Hyracks is a highly configurable platform and well-suited for several different data processing tasks. We do so via three different use cases: executing queries expressed in high-level declarative languages, running actual Hadoop jobs using the Hadoop Compatibility Layer of Hyracks, and finally, running parallel graph computations using Pregelix, an open source graph analytics platform that uses Hyracks and emulates Google's Pregel programming model for analyzing large graphs in parallel.

A number of new declarative parallel languages have been proposed for querying and analyzing very large data sets.
To aid with the construction of declarative parallel query compilers, we propose an extensible algebraic framework called Algebricks. Algebricks is a model-agnostic compilation framework that provides the ability for a compiler to inject its own semantics in an extensible manner. Algebricks includes a reusable and extensible set of logical and physical operators and a large set of general purpose rewrite rules useful to most query compilers. We describe the implementation of three different language compilers (AsterixDB for AQL, Hivesterix for HiveQL, and VXQuery for XQuery) that use the Algebricks compiler framework to create parallel jobs to run on a Hyracks Cluster.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td></td></tr></table></div><div style="height: 5px;"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="eventDate">May. 2, 2014</div></td><td><div class="eventInfor">SPEAKER: Dick Bulterman (FXPAL)</div><div class="eventInfor">Authoring Support for Social Media Interaction:

Understanding Compound Multimedia Dependencies</td></tr><tr><td><b>Abstract</b></td><td>	   Creating compelling multimedia content is a difficult task. It involves not only the creative process 

of developing a compelling media-based story, but it also requires significant technical support for 

content editing and management. This process is made more complex by an increased desire for 

media personalization: the story you tell Mom about an event may be different than the version 

you’d like to share with your friends. It is also different from the version you’d like to tell your own 

children 15 years after the event had taken place. The makes media authoring a context- and time-
sensitive problem. No wonder most researchers analyze media instead of create it!

It is tempting to categorize multimedia authoring in terms of component areas: media encoding, 

media storage, media access, media transport, media rendering and overall presentation 

composition and control. Unfortunately, this partitioning blurs the dependencies that exist among 

these component areas that ultimately determine the success of an authoring system. Using the 

broad problem of social media interaction as an example, this talk will consider the composite 

effects of creating and accessing and transporting and presenting rich media objects for use by non-
technical end users.

The talk will survey several approaches to describe and manage media interactions. We will focus 

on the temporal modelling of context-sensitive personalized interactions of complex collections of 

independent media objects. Using the concepts of ‘togetherness’ being employed in the EU’s FP-7 

project TA2: Together Anywhere, Together Anytime, we will follow the process of media capture, 

profiling, composition, sharing and end-user manipulation. We will consider the promise of using 

automated tools and contrast this with the reality of letting real users manipulation presentation 

semantics in real time.

The talk will not present a closed form solution, but will present a series of topics and problems that 

can stimulate the development of a new generation of systems to stimulate social media interaction.      </td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td> Dr. Dick Bulterman is President of the FX Palo Alto Laboratory (FXPAL) and professor of

EventShop is a computational framework that has the ability to integrate and process streaming data from heterogeneous data sources.  Data from all data sources are first transformed into a Space/Time/Theme (STT) data model, with a hierarchical extension of STT being used to handle data coming from sources that have different resolutions in space and/or time.   Various types of spatio-temporal operators can then be applied to recognize and predict actionable situations.  Appropriate actions/recommendations can be sent to individuals based on their circumstances.   This talk will provide an overview of the EventShop project and the sorts of use cases it is intending to address.

Data represented in the form of sets of counts is easy to acquire and 
can be surprisingly useful in practice. For example, a simple way to 
represent a set of documents is as a "bag of words" where each document 
is represented just by the counts of words that occur in the document, a 
representation that has been the basis for many successful applications 
of machine learning to text data. In this talk we will review some 
important developments over the past 10 years in modeling data 
represented in the form of counts, combining ideas from statistics and 
machine learning. The talk will describe the general principles involved 
and then illustrate how these ideas can be applied to text documents, 
email communications, and social networks, including recent work in my 
research group. The talk will conclude with some speculative comments on 
future directions.

Semantic Computing (SC) is an emerging field that addresses computing
technologies which allow users to search, create, manipulate and connect
computational resources (including data, documents, tools, people, agents,
devices, etc.) based on semantics.

Semantic Computing includes the computing technologies (e.g., artificial
intelligence, natural language, software engineering, data and knowledge
engineering, computer systems, signal processing, etc.), and their
interactions, that may be used to extract or process computational content
and descriptions. While some areas of Semantic Computing have appeared as
pieces in different disciplines, Semantic Computing glues these pieces
together into an integrated theme with synergetic interactions. It
addresses not only the analysis and transformation of signals (e.g.,
pixels, words) into useful information, but also how such information can
be accessed and used to synthesize new signals.

The National Science Foundation has approved the planning of an
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Semantic
Computing currently involving UCI, UCSD and UCLA. The missions of the
I/UCRC are to develop semantic technologies that may facilitate the
transition of the Internet into its next generation, and develop new
business models to stimulate, strengthen, and grow the economy.

An important outcome of this I/UCRC is a Semantic Problem Solving Network
(SPSN) which is a public consortium of resources from all domains
including data, documents, devices, products, services, and people. The
resources are interconnected and integrated with a service-oriented
architecture and a semantic layer to help the public to solve general
problems and professional users to solve domain specific problems (e.g.,
finance, IT, health, defense, entertainment, education, manufacturing).

This talk will introduce Semantic Computing and its applications, the
operations of the I/UCRC, the architecture of the SPSN, how companies and
academic researchers can join or affiliate with the I/UCRC and SPSN, and
how companies and academic researchers can benefit.

LLAMA is a subsystem designed for new hardware environments that supports an API for page-oriented access methods, providing both cache and storage management. Caching (CL) and storage (SL) layers use a common mapping table that separates a page’s logical and physical location. CL supports data updates and management updates (e.g., for index re-organization) via latch-free compare-and-swap atomic state changes on its mapping table. SL uses the same mapping table to cope with page location changes produced by log structuring on every page flush. To demonstrate LLAMA’s suitability, we tailored our latch-free Bw-tree implementation to use LLAMA. The Bw-tree is a B-tree style index. Layered on LLAMA, it has higher performance and scalability using real workloads compared with BerkeleyDB’s B-tree, which is known for good performance.

A new wave of systems is emerging in the space of Big Data Analytics that open the door to programming models beyond Hadoop MapReduce (HMR). It is well understood that HMR is not ideal for applications in the domain of machine learning and graph processing. This realization is fueling a number of new (Big Data) system efforts: Berkeley Spark, Google Pregel, GraphLab (CMU), and AsterixDB (UC Irvine), to name a few. Each of these add unique capabilities, but form islands around key functionalities: fault-tolerance, resource allocation, and data caching. In this talk, I will provide an overview of some Big Data systems starting with Google's MapReduce, which defined the foundational architecture for processing large data sets. I will then identify a key limitation in this architecture; namely, its inability to efficiently support iterative workflows. I will then describe real-world examples of systems that aim to fill this computational void. I will conclude with a description of my own work on a layering that unifies key runtime functionalities (fault-tolerance, resource allocation, data caching, and more) for workflows (both iterative and acyclic) that process large data sets.

real-world entity. Recent work has applied crowdsourcing to EM, and
has clearly established the promise of this approach. This work
however is limited in that it crowdsources only parts of the EM
workflow, requiring a developer who knows how to code to execute the
remaining parts. Consequently, this work does not scale to the growing
EM need at enterprises and crowdsourcing startups, and cannot handle
scenarios where ordinary users (i.e., the masses) want to leverage
crowdsourcing to match entities.

To address these problems, we propose the notion of hands-off
crowdsourcing (HOC), which crowdsources the entire workflow of a task,
thus requiring no developers. We show how HOC can represent a next
logical direction for crowdsourcing research, scale up EM at
enterprises and crowdsourcing startups, and open up crowdsourcing for
the masses. We describe Corleone, a HOC solution for EM. We show how
Corleone uses the crowd to generate blocking rules, applies active
learning to learn matchers, estimates accuracy given severe skew, and
identifies difficult-to-match pairs to which Corleone can apply more
complex matchers. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work to
executing crowdsourced RDBMS joins, cleaning learning models, and
soliciting complex information types from crowd workers.

While Big Data promises significant economic and social benefits, it also raises serious privacy concerns.  Real-time aggregate statistics of data collected from individuals can be shared to enable many applications such as disease surveillance and traffic monitoring.  However, it must be ensured that the privacy of individuals is not compromised.  While differential privacy has emerged as a de facto standard for private data analysis, directly applying the differential privacy mechanisms on time-series has limited utility due to high correlations between data values.  In this talk, I will present FAST, a novel Filtering and Adaptive Sampling based framework for monitoring aggregate Time-series under differential privacy.  FAST adaptively samples long time-series according to detected data dynamics and simultaneously uses filtering techniques to dynamically predict and correct released data values.

		Due to several faculty traveling and thus being MIA this coming Friday, the planned ISG seminar by Teradata is being postponed until later in the quarter.  Instead, this week's Friday ISG seminar slot will be used to invite ISG (and ICS) community participation in the forthcoming Beta Release of a new open source BDMS (Big Data Management System) that members of UCI's ASTERIX project have been working on for nearly four years.  We want this new "product", to be called AsterixDB, to be very high quality - and we are hereby inviting interested helpers at UCI to come hear about it and then help us polish it by downloading it and playing with it - trying out its data model, query language, and API for apps - kicking its tires - this Friday!  Our goal is to get a handful of "outside the team" folks to join us in using the system ahead of the Beta Release and then filing any issues using the GoogleCode issue tracking infrastructure - so that when we release this publically, it's well-polished and well shaken out.  (To date we have only delivered an Alpha Release, and only very recently, to one of our industrial partners.)  So - if you like database technology and would like to help us deliver "Big Data 2.0" to the world in a month or so - and you have time/interest in playing a bit in the very near term - PLEASE COME FRIDAY and we will show you what AsterixDB is all about!  This will be an informal presentation, based on giving a tour of our Alpha documentation and the release info on the GoogleCode wiki, and then having the team give a demo and even help you get the system working in real time if you bring your favorite laptop when you come.  We hope to see some of you there! (Refreshments will be provided, as usual for the ISG seminar, but we might upgrade the refreshments a little for this event; we'll see. We will also surely do something nice later for any outside folks who do end up significantly contributing in this manner to the quality of the release.)  If you plan to come on Friday, please RSVP to the speaker (mjcarey@ics.uci.edu) so we know what to maybe expect in terms of potential turnout.  Thx!

It
used to be that everything you cared about ran on a single database and the transaction system presented you the abstraction of a singularity;
your transaction happened at a single point in space (the database) and a single point in time (it looked like it was before or after all other transactions).

Now, we see a more complicated world.  Across the Internet, we put up HTML documents or send SOAP calls and these are not in a transaction.  Within a cluster, we typically write files in a file system and then read them later in a big map-reduce job that sucks up read-only files, crunches, and writes files as output.  Even inside the emerging many-core systems, we see high-performance computation on shared memory but increasing cost to using semaphores.  Indeed, it is clear that "Shared Memory Works Great as Long as You Don't Actually SHARE Memory".

There are emerging solutions which are based on immutable data.  It seems we need to look back to our grandparents and how they managed distributed work in the days before telephones.  We realize that "Accountants Don't Use Erasers" but rather accumulate immutable knowledge and then offer interpretations of their understanding based on the limited knowledge presented to them.  This talk will explore a number of the ways in which our new distributed systems leverage write-once and read-many immutable data.

Our framework utilizes the spatio-temporal statistical properties of an observed phenomena, with the goal of maximizing an application specified reward. Specifically, we define an observation of a phenomena by assigning it a discrete value (state) and we model its semantics as the transition between these values (states). This semantic model is used to predict the future states in which the phenomena is likely to be at, based on partially observed past states. To accomplish real-time agility, we designed an approximate, adaptive-grid solution for POMDPs that yields practically good results, and in some cases, guarantees on the quality of the approximation. We instantiate the framework in a camera network and use it perform real- time actuation of large-scale sensor networks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of actuating a large scale sensor network based on an approximated POMDP formulation. Our semantic model is simple enough to be implemented in real-time, yet powerful enough to capture meaningful semantics of typical behavior. Our action selection process is as fast as a table lookup in real-time.

Flash storage is poised to take a large
chunk of the market, having grown significantly in capacity and production, driven by consumer electronics.
Flash's technical advantages over disk promise storage arrays that are faster and easier to use while consuming less power and costing less.

The downsides of flash (inc. large erase blocks, limited overwrites, and higher price) mean that using flash as a drop-in
replacement for disk leads to increased price, volatile performance, and decreased reliability.
In this talk, we describe the design of the Pure FlashArray, an enterprise storage array built around consumer flash storage.
The array and its software, Purity, play to the advantages of flash while minimizing the downsides. Purity writes to flash
in multiples of the erase block size and stores its metadata in a key-value store that minimizes overwrites and stores approximate
answers, trading extra reads for fewer writes. And, Purity reduces data stored on flash through a range of techniques, including
compression, deduplication, and thin provisioning.

The net result is a flash array that deliver a sustained read-write workload of over 100,000 4kb I/O requests per second while
maintaining sub-millisecond latency. With many customers seeing 4x or greater data reduction, the Pure FlashArray ends up
being cheaper than disk too.

Any modern software system of note has two key characteristics: it is a distributed system, and it manages significant amounts of data.  As a result, the topic of distributed data consistency has become a key problem in the engineering of modern software systems.  Conventional distributed systems wisdom dictates that perfect consistency is too expensive to guarantee in general, and consistency mechanisms—if they are used at all—should be reserved for infrequent, small-scale, mission-critical tasks.   Like most design maxims, these ideas are not so easy to translate into practice; all kinds of unavoidable tactical questions pop up.  For example:

 • Exactly where in my multifaceted system is loose consistency “good enough” to meet application needs?
 • How do I know that my “mission-critical” software isn’t tainted by my “best effort” components?
 • How do I ensure that my design maxims are maintained as software and developer teams evolve?

Until recently, answers to these questions have been more a matter of folklore than mathematics.

In this talk, I will describe the CALM Theorem, which links Consistency And Logical Monotonicity, and discuss how it can inform distributed software development.  I'll also describe Bloom, a "disorderly" distributed programming language developed in my group.  Bloom admits a form of automated CALM analysis, which enables a compiler to answer questions like the ones above.    

Time permitting, I will also point out some additional results from my two main research projects: the BOOM project on large-scale system development, and the d^p project on human interaction in the data analysis lifecycle.

This is cited as the central reason why many federal, healthcare, and financial organizations have  not embraced cloud computing in a major way in spite of its many benefits. In this talk we consider the central problem of "data confidentiality", that arises while storing sensitive data in the cloud. While data encryption is an obvious solution for ensuring confidentiality, standard algorithms like AES make the data unusable in the cloud. For example, keyword search or database queries cannot be evaluated against the encrypted data. Over the past decade, many new schemes have been developed, that admit a variety of computations directly on the encrypted representation.  We give a brief overview of some of the important techniques proposed in this arena, specifically, for evaluating keyword-match and range queries. Finally, we describe our own contributions to this area and conclude with a discussion about open problems and future directions.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td>

In this talk, we examine this trade-off in the context of quorum-replicated data stores. Under partial, or non-strict quorum replication, a data store waits for responses from a subset of replicas before answering a query, without guaranteeing that read and write replica sets intersect. As deployed in practice, these configurations provide only basic eventual consistency guarantees, with no limit to the recency of data returned. However, anecdotally, partial quorums are often “good enough” for practitioners given their latency benefits.

We explain why partial quorums are regularly acceptable in practice, analyzing both the staleness of data they return and the latency benefits they offer. We introduce Probabilistically Bounded Staleness (PBS) consistency, which provides expected bounds on staleness with respect to both versions and wall clock time. We derive a closed-form solution for versioned staleness as well as model real-time staleness for representative Dynamo-style systems under internet-scale production workloads. Using PBS, we measure the latency-consistency trade-off for partial quorum systems. We quantitatively demonstrate how and why eventually consistent systems frequently return consistent data within tens of milliseconds while offering significant latency benefits.

Recently, there are more and more demands for analyzing Big Graph Data.  For example,  the scale of the world wide web keeps expanding to billions of web pages and hyper-links, the key social network sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter all have a rapidly growing gigantic social graph, and the biology science people assemble genomes from huge de Bruijn graphs.  To analyze such Big graphs requires a system which can not only scale out to hundreds or thousands of machines, but also do the computation very efficiently.  In this talk, I will introduce the Pregelix system,  which supports easy programming and scales to large commodity machine clusters. I will first illustrate the programming model -- application programmers need zero knowledge of the parallel/distributed system,  but just "think like a vertex" and write a couple of functions that encapsulate the logic for what one graph vertex does.  After that, I will detail the shining internals of Pregelix,  including the system architecture,  the scalable dataflow runtime,  the execution strategies, and the out-of-core support.  Then,  I will walk through a few examples built on top of Pregelix, such as PageRank and connected components.  Finally I will demonstrate our performance numbers and conclude the talk. (Truth in lending disclosure: the programming model and API were shamelessly borrowed from Google's Pregel graph analytics platform, hence the name:-))

These systems are being applied to new applications from diverse domains other than (traditional) relational OLAP, making it difficult to understand the tradeoffs between them and the workloads for which they were built. We present a taxonomy of existing system stacks based on their architectural components and the design choices made related to data processing and programmability to sort this space. We further demonstrate a web repository for sharing Big Data analytics platform information and use cases.

 Data from real-world applications is regarded as the golden standard for database systems evaluation. Unfortunately, finding appropriate real-world datasets is often hard due to various privacy-related constraints. To overcome this problem, we developed the Myriad Parallel Data Generator Toolkit - a generic toolkit for declarative specification of synthetic data generators that provides built-in parallelization support for the specified data generation programs. In this talk, I will motivate and present the main technical challenges solved by the highly-parallel execution model of the Myriad Toolkit. In addition, to demonstrate the usability of the toolkit, I will also give a brief overview of the supported data generator specification syntax and explain how different statistical constraints for the generated data can be implemented using the appropriate combination of specification routines.

 Parallel data flow systems are a central part of most analytic pipelines for big data. The iterative nature of many analysis and machine learning algorithms, however, is still a challenge for current systems. While certain types of bulk iterative algorithms are supported by novel data flow frameworks, these systems cannot exploit computational dependencies present in many algorithms, such as graph algorithms. As a result, these algorithms are inefficiently executed and have led to specialized systems based on other paradigms, such as message passing or shared memory. We propose a method to integrate "incremental iterations", a form of workset iterations, with parallel data flows. After showing how to integrate bulk iterations into a dataflow system and its optimizer, we present an extension to the programming model for incremental iterations. The extension alleviates for the lack of mutable state in dataflows and allows for exploiting the "sparse computational dependencies" inherent in many iterative algorithms. The evaluation of a prototypical implementation shows that those aspects lead to up to two orders of magnitude speedup in algorithm runtime, when exploited. In our experiments, the improved dataflow system is highly competitive with specialized systems while maintaining a transparent and unified data flow abstraction.

Many systems for big data analytics employ a data flow programming abstraction to define parallel data processing tasks. In this setting, custom operations expressed as user-defined functions are very common. We address the problem of performing data flow optimization at this level of abstraction, where the semantics of operators are not known. Traditionally, query optimization is applied to queries with known algebraic semantics. In this work, we find that a handful of properties, rather than a full algebraic specification, suffice to establish reordering conditions for data processing operators. We show that these properties can be accurately estimated for black box operators using a shallow static code analysis pass based on reverse data and control flow analysis over the general-purpose code of their user-defined functions. We design and implement an optimizer for parallel data flows that does not assume knowledge of semantics or algebraic properties of operators. Our evaluation confirms that the optimizer can apply common rewritings such as selection reordering, bushy join order enumeration, and limited forms of aggregation push-down, hence yielding similar rewriting power as modern relational DBMS optimizers. Moreover, it can optimize the operator order of non-relational data flows, a unique feature among today's systems.

            In this talk, we describe the CloudProtect system from the recently accepted paper in IEEE Cloud 2012. The CloudProtect middleware empowers users to encrypt sensitive data stored within various cloud applications. However, most web applications require data in plaintext for implementing the various functionalities and in general, do not support encrypted data management. Therefore, CloudProtect strives to carry out the data transformations (encryption/decryption) in a manner that is transparent to the application, i.e., preserves all functionalities of the application, including those that require data to be in plaintext. Additionally, CloudProtect allows users flexibility in trading off performance for security in order to let them optimally balance their privacy needs and usage-experience.
            This paper explores an efficient and secure mechanism
            to partition computations across public and private
            machines in a hybrid cloud setting. We propose a principled
            framework for distributing data and processing in a hybrid
            cloud that meets the conflicting goals of performance, sensitive
            data disclosure risk and resource allocation costs. The proposed
            solution is implemented as an add-on tool for a Hadoop and
            Hive based cloud computing infrastructure. Our experiments
            demonstrate that the developed mechanism can lead to a
            major performance gain by exploiting both the hybrid cloud

analytics, but understanding and debugging multi-step dataflows that ingest
large volumes of data remains a fundamental challenge.  We are building a
system called Newt, a scalable architecture for capturing fine-grain,
record-level provenance from these data-intensive scalable compute (DISC)
systems in a generic manner.  Developers leverage a unique API to
instrument these systems, actively capturing fine-grain lineage across
multi-step, perhaps non-relational, transformations.   We report on our 
experiences instrumenting Hyracks and Hadoop, and find that Newt's capture 
incurs 16-26% time overheads for the PigMix benchmark and a 14% overhead

Our work is based on Craig Gentry's revolutionary recent work on fully homomorphic encryption (first such scheme was published in 2009). We utilize Craig Gentry's scheme for query processing, while maintaining the algebraic framework that is a key aspect of database systems. There are several avenues for future investigation: exploring physical implementations for algebraic operators beyond what we have investigated; exploring query optimization and utilization of indexes; exploring feasibility of Craig Gentry's fully homomorphic encryption in the context of databases as some aspects of his scheme are very time consuming.

and researchers in a wide variety of domains recognize
that there is tremendous value and insight to be gained by
warehousing this emerging data and making it available for querying,

applications poses challenging requirements against data management
platforms in terms of scalability, flexibility, manageability,
and analysis capabilities. At UC Irvine, we are building a nextgeneration

trends. We present ongoing work that approaches the following
questions: How does data get into the system? What primitives
should we provide to better cope with dirty/noisy data? How can
we support efficient data analysis on spatial data? Using real examples,
we show the capabilities of ASTERIX for ingesting data via
feeds, supporting set-similarity predicates for fuzzy matching, and
answering spatial aggregation queries.

a user types in a query. It has become increasingly popular
in recent years due to its simplicity and power. In an instant-
search system, every keystroke from a user triggers a new
request to the server. Therefore, its log has a richer content
than that of a traditional search system, and previous log
analysis research is not applicable to this type of log. In
this study, we present the problem of analyzing the query
log of an instant-search system. We propose a classification
scheme for user typing behaviors. We also compare the log
of an instant-search system and that of a traditional search
system on the same data. The results show that on a people
directory search system, instant search can typically save
2 seconds per search, reduce the typing effort by showing
the results with fewer characters entered, and increase the
success rate.

In particular, I focus on solutions for synchronization problem in multisimulation to orchestrate consistent information flow through multiple simulator: (1) a transaction-based approach to modeling the synchronization problem in multisimulations by mapping it to a problem similar to multidatabase concurrency; we express multisimulation synchronization as a scheduling problem where the goal is to generate “correct schedules” for time advancement and data exchange across simulators that meets the dependencies without loss of concurrency, (2) a hybrid scheduling strategy which adapts itself to the “right” level of pessimism/optimism based on the state of the execution and underlying dependencies, and (3) relaxation model for dependencies which guarantee bounded violation of consistency to support higher levels of concurrency. We also develop two key optimizations: (a) efficient checkpointing/rollback techniques, and (b) relaxation model for dependencies which guarantee bounded violation of consistency to support higher levels of concurrency. We evaluate our proposed techniques via a detailed case study from the emergency response domain by integrating three disparate simulators – a fire simulator (CFAST), an evacuation simulator (Drillsim) and a communication simulator (LTEsim).

In the first part of the talk, I'll describe our ongoing research in leveraging human computation for tasks related to data. Human computation ("crowdsourcing") augments traditional computation with the use of human abilities to solve sub-problems that are difficult for computers, e.g., object or image comparisons, information extraction, relevance judgements, and data gathering. We are addressing two different types of data-centric human computation: (1) Fundamental algorithms, such as sorting, clustering, and data cleaning, in which the basic operations (e.g., compare, filter) are performed by humans. (2) A database-system like platform in which declarative queries are posed by users, and the system orchestrates a combination of stored and crowdsourced data to answer them. Common to both areas is the need to formalize and optimize new tradeoffs among latency (humans are much slower than computers), cost (humans require real money to perform tasks), and quality (humans are inaccurate and inconsistent).
In the second part of the talk, I'll describe my recent experience teaching introductory databases to 60,000 students. Admittedly only 25,000 of them submitted their homework, and a mere 6500 achieved a strong final score. But even with 6500 students, I more than quadrupled the total number of students I've taught in my entire 18-year academic career. I began by "flipping" the way I teach my Stanford course and, as a side-effect, making all components of the course freely available online. But the big inflection point came when I offered the online course in a structured fashion with a schedule, automatically-graded assignments and exams, and most importantly a worldwide community of students. I'll cover a variety of topics related to the massive online course, both logistical and social, while avoiding speculation on the future of higher education.

state agencies are extremely valuable in 1) real-time decision-making, planning, and management of the
transportation systems, and 2) conducting research to develop new policies to enhance the efficacy of the
transportation systems. In this talk, I will present our data-driven framework, dubbed TransDec (short
for Transportation Decision-Making), which enables real-time integration, visualization, querying, and
analysis of dynamic and archived transportation data. I will show that considering the large size of the
transportation data, variety of the data (different modalities and resolutions), and frequent changes of the
data, implementation of such a scalable system that allows for effective querying and analysis of both
archived and real-time data is an intrinsically challenging data management task. Subsequently, I will
focus on a route-planning problem where the weights on the road-network edges vary as a function of
time due to the variability of traffic congestion. I will show that naïve approaches to address this problem
are either inaccurate or slow, motivating the need for new solutions. Consequently, I will discuss our
initial approach to this problem and demonstrate its implementation within the TransDec framework.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td>Cyrus Shahabi is a Professor and the Director of the Information Laboratory (InfoLAB) at the Computer

For example a recent Cisco report indicates that mobile data traffic will increase 39 times by 2015, while 66% of such boost is due to video traffic. Network capacity issue may be partially coped by deploying more cellular base stations, installing dedicated broadcast networks, or upgrading the cellular base stations to support 4G. However, these approaches all result in additional costs on new network infrastructure, and might not be fully compatible with existing
obile devices. Also, according to the report, the network capacity provided by cellular network providers is predicted to be only 10 time increasing by 2015, which implies that the above methods do not still meet the requirement for increasing mobile traffic. A better way is moving data to other networks to reduce heavy traffic in cellular networks. In our research, we study motivations and methods to offload part of mobile traffic from cellular networks to other networks such as WiFi or Ad Hoc, which are available in most modern smartphones. Such these methods are cheap, practical, and easily implemented.</td></tr></table></div><div style="height: 5px;"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="eventDate">March. 1, 2012 (Special Time\Place)</div></td><td><div class="eventInfor">SPEAKER: Archan Misra (Singapore Management University) </div><div class="eventInfor">Real-time Mobile Sensing/Analytics and the LiveLabs Experimentation Platform</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><a href="#" onclick='var x=getElementById("e99126");if(x.style.display!="none"){x.style.display="none";}else{x.style.display="block";}return false;'>Details</a></td></tr><tr class="detr"><td colspan="2"><div id="e99126" style="display:none;border:solid grey;border-width:1px;"><table><tr><td style="width:100px;"><b>Date and Time</b></td><td>March. 1, 2012 (Special Time\Place) 11 am</td></tr><tr><td><b>Location</b></td><td>DBH 4011</td></tr></table><br></br><table><tr><td style="width:100px;"><b>Speaker</b></td><td>Archan Misra (Singapore Management University) </td></tr><tr><td><b>Title</b></td><td>Real-time Mobile Sensing/Analytics and the LiveLabs Experimentation Platform</td></tr><tr><td><b>Abstract</b></td><td>

            Data management workloads are increasingly write-intensive and subject
to strict latency SLAs.  This presents a dilemma: Traditional update
in place systems have unmatched latency properties but poor write
throughput.  In contrast, existing log structured techniques
significantly improve write throughput but generally sacrifice read
performance and exhibit unacceptable latency spikes.

We begin by presenting a new performance metric: read fanout, and
argue that, along with read amplification and write amplification, it
better characterizes the real-world performance of index algorithms than
existing approaches such as asymptotic analysis and price/performance.

We then present a Log Structured Merge (LSM) tree implementation that
combines the best properties of B-Trees and log structured approaches:
(1) Unlike existing log structured trees, our implementation has
near-optimal read and scan performance, and (2) we present merge
algorithms that bound write latencies without impacting write
throughput or allowing merges to block application writes for extended
periods of time.  We do this by introducing a new ``spring and gear''
scheduler that ensures merges at each level of the tree make steady
progress.  This allows us to avoid blocking application writes without
resorting to techniques that degrade read performance.

We use Bloom filters to improve index performance, and find that a
number of subtleties arise.  First, it is important to ensure that
reads can safely stop after finding the first version of a record.
Otherwise, frequently written items will incur multiple disk
lookups.  Second, many applications and data management architectures
check for preexisting values at insertion time.  Avoiding the disk
seek performed by the check is crucial for such applications.

In this talk I will discuss our work in this area, as carried out at Wisconsin, Kosmix, and @WalmartLabs. I describe how we integrate data from 'traditional' Web sources to build a global taxonomy, greatly expand it with social-media data, then leverage it to build consumer-facing applications. Example applications include building topic pages, detecting Twitter events, and monitoring these events. I discuss the critical role of data integration and human computation in processing social media.

The FORWARD project replaces such low level code with declarative specifications. Its cornerstones are 
(i) the unified application state virtual database, which enables modeling and manipulating the entire application state in an extension of SQL, named SQL++ 
(ii) specification of Ajax pages as essentially rendered views over the unified application state.
Consequently the following three problems are resolved by appropriate reduction to data management problems, where prior database research literature is leveraged and extended.
1. The partial change of Ajax pages, in response to application state changes, is reduced to an incremental view maintenance problem. Id's that retain the provenance of the page data play an instrumental efficiency role.
2. Efficient data access is reduced to semistructured query processing over an integrated view that involves large database(s) and small main memory-based sources.
3. The inherent location transparency of the specifications is exploited in order to perform computation at the appropriate location (browser vs server). More broadly, the talk discusses ongoing and future work in utilizing the increased abilities of HTML5 clients towards achieving low latency mobile web applications applications, while location transparency of the specifications is retained.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td>

These systems hold their data in one or a relatively small number of computers. With a tightly defined schema and transactional consistency, the results returned from queries are crisp and accurate.
New systems have humongous amounts of data content, change rates, and querying rates and take lots of computers to hold and process. The data quality and meaning are fuzzy. The schema, if present, is likely to vary across the data. The origin of the data may be suspect, and its staleness may vary.
Today's data systems coalesce data from many sources. The Internet, B2B, and enterprise application integration (EAI) combine data from different places. No computer is an island. This large amount of interconnectivity and interdependency has led to a relaxation of many database principles. 
In this talk, consider the some of the ways in which today's answers differ from what we used to expect.

The need for efficient data generation for the purposes of testing and benchmarking newly developed data-intensive computing systems has increased with the emergence of
big data problems. As synthetic data model specifications evolve over time the data generator programs implementing these models have to be continuously adapted –
 a task that might become complex as the set of model constraints grows. This talk presents Myriad - a new parallel data generation toolkit. Data generators created
  with the toolkit can produce very large datasets by exploiting a completely parallel execution model, while at the same time maintain cross-partition dependencies, correlations and distributions in the generated data. 
In addition, I report on our efforts towards a benchmark suite for large-scale parallel analysis systems that uses Myriad for the generation of large social network graphs and OLAP-style relational datasets.

Machine learning practitioners are increasingly interested in applying their algorithms to Big Data. Unfortunately, current high-level 
languages for data analytics (e.g., Hive, Pig, Sawzall, Scope) do not fully cover this domain. One key missing ingredient is the means to 
efficiently support iteration over the data. Zaharia et al., were the first to answer this call from a systems perspective with Spark. 
Spark adds the notion of a working set to data-parallel workflows and has published speed-ups of 30x over Hadoop MapReduce for many machine learning and graph algorithms.

Unfortunately, Spark does cover the whole pipeline of Big Data analytics; at Yahoo!, it is common to compose Pig, MPI and direct MapReduce program modules into workflows. 
This fractioning of individual processing steps can be a major pain e.g., for optimization, debugging, and code readability. Our prescription to this dilemma is a new DSL 
for data analytics called ScalOps. Like Pig, ScalOps combines the declarative style of SQL and the low-level procedural style of MapReduce. Like Spark, ScalOps can optimize

					In most practical systems, resources are either constrained or mutually exclusive. Constraints arise from network bandwidth restrictions, I/O and disk usage from writing images, 
					and CPU usage needed to extract features from the images. Detecting events in real time requires dynamically choosing a subset of the available sensors for processing at any given time. 
Furthermore, certain camera configurations are not feasible. For example, a camera cannot zoom into two different regions in its field of view.
Zooming into a specific area in the field of view of a camera would generate a high resolution image of the region in the expense of a wider field of view. 
Thus, the field of view needs to be changed dynamically to get a higher resolution images of certain regions of the space at the expanse other regions. 
In order to illustrate the complexity of this problem, consider a face recognition application, which is only interested in high resolution (by means of optical zoom) 
facial images. If we always zoom into a region to look for a high res face, we might miss presence of a person in different region and hence opportunity for zooming later to get the face in next time step.
In this talk we examine the problem of scheduling sensors for data collection and actuating them on real time to maximize some user-specified objective - e.g., 
detecting as much motion as possible or collect as many high resolution facial images. 
The main idea behind our approach is the use of sensor semantics to guide the scheduling process. We learn a dynamic probabilistic model of motion correlations 
between cameras, and use the model to guide resource allocation for our sensor network.
Although previous work has leveraged probabilistic models for sensor-scheduling, our work is distinct in its focus on real-time building-monitoring using a camera network.  
We validate our approach using a sensor network of a dozen cameras spread throughout a university building, recording measurements of unscripted human activity over a two week period. 
We automatically learn a semantic model of typical behaviors, and show that one can significantly improve efficiency of resource allocation and actuation by exploiting this model.

In this talk I will describe a new approach to datacenter storage called RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems are created by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity servers.  A RAMCloud can provide durable and available storage with 100-1000x the throughput of disk-based systems and 100-1000x lower access latency.  By combining low latency and large scale, RAMClouds will enable a new class of applications that manipulate large datasets more intensively than has ever been possible.

Most of those languages (Microsoft's Linq, University of Edinburgh's Links, EPFL's Scala, Yahoo!'s Pig Latin, IBM's Thorn, etc) rely on the classic notion of comprehensions over collections. At the language level, comprehensions are a perfect choice, being well understood programming constructs, and capturing the expressive power of SQL iterators. At the compiler level, however, they are at odds with database optimizers which mostly rely on relational (or nested-relational) algebras. That mismatch was clearly on display during the design of XQuery, whose semantics is based on comprehensions, and for which most implementations target relational backends. We propose a alternative functional semantic formulation of XQuery to the one proposed by W3C, which is also based on comprehensions but has the benefit of corresponding precisely to compilation into a typed algebra that supports traditional database optimizations. First, this provides a formal foundation for XQuery implementations that want to ensure semantics integrity with the standard, along with modern database optimization techniques. Also, it provides key insights into the nature of database compilers that we believe is essential for the integration of database and programming languages technology. We notably discover that type systems for database algebras require an original solution to the old problem of subtyping with record concatenation, and that such a type system can eliminate the need for complex side conditions used in query language optimization.

Yahoo, and Microsoft, have adopted techniques that provide eventual
consistency.  This talk explores the hows and whys of different consistency
models.  The discussion will be driven by a simple example: maintaining the
score of a baseball game. We'll see that people with various roles in the

face of fluid network connectivity, redefinable content filters, and
arbitrary updates.  Notably, Cimbiosys guarantees that each device
eventually stores precisely those items whose latest version matches its
custom filter and represents its replication-specific metadata in a compact
form, resulting in low data synchronization overhead.  This permits ad hoc
replication between newly encountered devices and frequent synchronization
between established partners, even over low bandwidth wireless networks or

collection of strings those that are similar to a given query string.
Answering such queries is important in many applications such
as data cleaning and record linkage, where errors could occur
in queries as well as the data. Many existing algorithms have
focused on in-memory indexes. In this paper we investigate how
to efficiently answer such queries in a disk-based setting, by
systematically studying the effects of storing data and indexes
on disk. We devise a novel physical layout for an inverted
index to answer queries and we study how to construct it with
limited buffer space. To answer queries, we develop a cost-based,
adaptive algorithm that balances the I/O costs of retrieving
candidate matches and accessing inverted lists. Experiments
on large, real datasets verify that simply adapting existing
algorithms to a disk-based setting does not work well and that our
new techniques answer queries efficiently. Further, our solutions
significantly outperform a recent tree-based index, BED-tree.

            	has been increasing exponentially. According to recent estimates, 6 Billion photos are uploaded
            	 on Facebook per month. It is difficult to get an overview of a large collection of personal 
            	 photos without browsing though the entire database manually. In this talk, I will discuss a 
            	 framework to generate representative subset summaries from photo collections present on personal 
            	 archives or social networks. I will define salient properties of an effective photo summary 
            	 and model summarization as an optimization of these properties, given the size constraints. 
            	 Computer vision, and IR  based techniques will be used to generate summaries that "look good" as well as 
            	 are informative. I will also introduce information theory based metrics for evaluating photo 
            	 summaries based on their information content and the ability to satisfy user's information needs. 
            	 I will also discuss the manual evaluation experiments that were done to evaluate summaries.

in classification to find a subspace that maximally separates
class patterns according to the Fisher Criterion.   It was
previously proven that a pre-whitening step can be used to
truly optimize the Fisher Criterion. In this talk, we show that
more insight and more applications may be derived from this
classical technique.

First, we explore the subspaces induced by this whitened FLD.
In particular, we show how the Identity Space and Variation
Space are useful for decomposing and representing data.
We give sufficient conditions for these spaces to exist.  Through
experiments we also show how these spaces may
be used for classification and image synthesis.

Second, we further extend classical Fisher to handle data exhibiting
multiple factors (modes), e.g. face images that exhibit personal
identity, illumination, and pose.  We call our method Multimodal
Discriminant Analysis (MMDA), which is useful for decomposing
a dataset into independent modes. For face images, MMDA
effectively separates identity, illumination and pose into mutually
orthogonal subspaces.  MMDA is based on maximizing the
Fisher Criterion on all modes simultaneously, and is therefore
well-suited for multimodal and mode-invariant pattern recognition.
We also show that MMDA may be used for dimension reduction,
and for synthesizing face images under novel illumination, and
even novel personal identity.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td>Terence Sim is an Asst. Prof. at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore.  He teaches an undergraduate course in computer vision, as well as a graduate course in multimedia fundamentals.  For research, he works primarily in these areas:  face recognition, biometrics, and computational photography.   He is also interested in computer vision problems in general, such as shape-from-shading, photometric stereo, object recognition.  On the side, he dabbles with some aspects of music processing, such as polyphonic music transcription.  Dr. Sim serves as Vice-Chairman of the Biometrics Technical Committee (BTC), Singapore, and Chairman of the Cross-Jurisdictional and Societal Aspects Working Group (WG6) within the BTC.

This enabled powerful tools for mapping discovery and integration code generation, greatly simplifying the integration process.  However, further progress is needed. We see an opportunity to raise the level of abstraction further, and propose two new principles that the next generation of integration systems should embody. Holistic information integration supports iteration across the various integration tasks, leveraging information about both schema and data to improve the integrated result. Integration independence allows applications to be independent of how, when, and where information integration takes place, making materialization and the timing of transformations an optimization decision that is transparent to applications. This talk introduces these principles and describes some promising recent work in these directions. </td></tr><tr><td><b>Speaker Bio</b></td><td> Laura Haas is an IBM Fellow and has been director of computer science at IBM Almaden Research Center since 2005.
