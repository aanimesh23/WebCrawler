Dynamic TCP Acknowledgement: Penalizing Long Delays<br>
Josiah Carlson</h2>

<p>We study the problem of acknowledging a sequence of data packets that
are sent across a TCP connection.  We investigate a new objective
function that minimizes the sum of the number of acknowledgements sent
and the maximum delay incurred for any of the packets.
We develop a deterministic online algorithm that achieves a competitive
ratio of &pi;<sup>2</sup>/6 and prove that no deterministic algorithm
can have a smaller competitiveness.  We also study a generalized
objective function where delays are taken to the <i>p</i>th power.
Finally, we show lower bounds for randomized algorithms on these problems.</p>
