Falcon Codes: Fast, Authenticated LT-Codes
</h1>
<h2>
Nikos Triandopoulos, RSA Laboratories and Boston U.
</h2>

<p>
This talk will introduce Falcon codes, a class of authenticated
error-correcting codes that are based on LT-codes and achieve the following
properties, for the first time simultaneously: (1) With high probability, they
can correct adversarial symbol corruptions in the encoding of a message, and
(2) they allow for very efficient encoding/decoding times, even linear in the
message length. 

<p>
We will study Falcon codes in a new adversarial model for rateless codes over
computational channels, under a new security notion for corruption-tolerant
encoding in this model. We will then present three variant Falcon codes that
via judicious use of simple cryptographic tools achieve resilience to
adversarial corruptions yet feature very fast coding times. Each such code
offers different performance trade-offs; for instance, one variant works well
with small input messages (100s of KB to 10s of MB) but the other two, by
design, handle much larger messages (several GBs). Finally, we will overview
results from an experimental analysis of the practicality of Falcon codes, as
well as concrete applications in cloud and network security where these codes
can bring improvements, including the design of faster Proof-of-Retrievability
schemes and the full protection of the widely-used, standardized Raptor codes,
against vulnerabilities recently demonstrated by Lopes and Neves (Oakland,
2014). This is joint work with Ari Juels, James Kelley and Roberto Tamassia.
