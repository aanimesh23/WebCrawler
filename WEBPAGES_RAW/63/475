Retroactive Data Structures
<br>
Michael Nelson
</h2>

<p>
This is a presentation of the paper "Retroactive Data Structures" by
Erik D. Demaine, John Iacono, and Stefan Langerman, SODA 2004.   
<p>

The authors introduce a new data structuring paradigm called
<i>retroactive data structures</i>.&nbsp; In these data structures,
the historical sequence of operations performed on the data structure
is not fixed.&nbsp; They allow the insertion and deletion of
<i>operations</i> at arbitrary past times, subject only to
consistency.&nbsp; The authors initiate the study of retroactive data
structures by formally defining the model and its variants.&nbsp; They
show that retroactivity differs from persistence in that efficient
retroactivity is not always achievable, and therefore go on to present
several specific retroactive data structures as well as techniques for
transforming certain classes of data structures into their retroactive
equivalents.&nbsp; I will present the retroactive model and touch on a
selection of their results.
