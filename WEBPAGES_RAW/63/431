Fall Quarter 2013 &mdash; <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/"> Information and Computer Sciences</A> &mdash; <A HREF="http://www.uci.edu/">UC Irvine</A></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>Teaching Assistant Seminar (ICS 398A)</FONT></P>
<P>
<B>COURSE REFERENCE</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<B>Instructor:</B>  <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/">David G. Kay</A>,
5056 Donald Bren Hall.  Stop by any time, or send electronic mail to &quot;<code>kay</code>&quot;.</FONT></P>
<P>
<B>Meeting time and place:</B>  Fridays,
1:00 to 2:50 p.m. in room ICS 180.  As a two-unit class, ICS 398A will meet
for about 15 hours in total.</FONT></P>
<P>
<B>Enrollment information:</B>  All new or
prospective ICS teaching assistants are required to attend ICS 398A, which
is offered this year only in the fall quarter.  It&#39;s ideal to
take ICS 398 in the first quarter you&#39;re actually teaching, although that isn&#39;t
always possible. But if you know you won't be teaching until next year, you could wait until then.</FONT></P>
<P>
ICS 398B, the Advanced TA Seminar, is offered
some years in the spring quarter (but not in 2014).  ICS 398B covers such issues as designing
assignments, exams, and courses, assigning grades, and other issues in running
your own course; it is valuable for everyone, and required for TAs who may
wish to teach their own classes (as many grad students do in summer session
or through University Extension, not to mention in their own academic jobs).
 You  may take ICS 398B later
in your career, but you must complete it before you can be appointed as
an instructor in summer session or Extension.</FONT></P>
<P>
<B>Course requirements:</B>  This seminar
is not designed to impose a time burden on the participants beyond the class
meetings themselves.  Grading is satisfactory/unsatisfactory or pass/not-pass,
and we ask only that you attend the meetings, participate in the discussions
and activities, give one or two short presentations on material you expect
to be teaching, and arrange through the campus <a href="http://www.tltc.uci.edu/">Teaching, Learning &amp; Technology Center</a>
(x46188) to be videotaped in your class (whichever quarter you will be teaching).</FONT></P>
<P>Any benefit you get from this course (unlike most computer science classes, but like most seminars) comes from the in-class discussions and activities. We expect everyone to attend every meeting; that's not asking very much. You may have to miss a meeting (e.g., because you have to travel to a conference), but missing more than one will not be looked on favorably. Please check your calendar for the rest of the quarter and resolve any conflicts now.</FONT></P>
<P>
<B>Topics to be covered:</B>  In a seminar
like this, the topics don&#39;t all come in a predetermined order.  Over
the course of the quarter we will cover the following, and more:  motivating
students, teaching techniques and styles, grading exams and assignments,
dealing with cheating and problem students, working with faculty, departmental
and university policies.  Most of our time will be devoted to discussion
and hands-on participatory activities.</FONT></P>

<!--If you don&#39;t have an assigned office (or
prefer not to hold your scheduled office hours there), you may use a designated
room in the Computer Science Trailer (where the ICS Student Affairs Office
is).  Eventually workstations and a printer may be installed there, which
you may use for grading and class preparation; there is no keycard mechanism
to charge for use of this printer.  To schedule times in this room, check
with Bing Barcega (<A HREF="mailto:bbarcega@uci.edu">bbarcega@uci.edu</A>).</FONT></P>

<P>If you don't have an assigned office (or prefer not to hold your scheduled office hours there), you may use a designated room (ICS 406A or 406B) by advance reservation with the appropriate staff support person in your department: in Statistics, Rosemary Busta [rbusta@ics.uci.edu]; in Computer Science, Carolyn Simpson [cmsimpso@ics.uci.edu]; in Informatics, Suzie Barrows [sbarrows@uci.edu]),</FONT></P>
