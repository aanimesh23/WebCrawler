<h1>Layered Graph Drawing</h1>
</div>

<p>A planar graph is one that can be drawn in the plane with no
crossing edges. Planar graphs have been investigated for a long
time, and it is known (F&aacute;ry's theorem) that any planar graph
can be drawn in such a way that all edges are straight line
segments.</p>

<p>But what can you do when a graph is not planar? I and my co-authors
have been studying drawings in which the edges are grouped into layers
(shown here as colors) such that no two edges in the same layer
cross. It turns out (unlike for planar graphs) that it makes a
difference whether you require the edges to be straight line
segments. The minimum number of layers in a drawing, if you allow curved
edges, is a well studied concept known as the <i>thickness</i> of the
graph. The minimum number of layers in a drawing with straight edges is
a less well studied concept which we call the <i>geometric
thickness.</i></p>

<h2>Complete Graphs</h2>

<p>The following drawing shows that the geometric thickness of the
complete graph on twelve vertices (K<sub>12</sub>) is at most
three:</p>

<div align="CENTER"><img src="K12.png" width="514" height="434"
alt="Three-layer drawing of K_{12}"><br>
</div>

<p>The central hexagon of this drawing is a little hard to see, so
here is a closer view:</p>

<div align="CENTER"><img src="K12ctr.png" width="432" height="350"
alt="Close-up drawing of K_{12}"><br>
</div>

<p>The pattern used for this drawing can be generalized to show that,
for any n, the graph K<sub>n</sub> can be drawn in at most ceiling(n/4)
layers [Eppstein et al, JGAA 2000]. We also have a lower bound that at
least n/5.646 layers are needed. Since K<sub>n</sub> is known to have
n/6-layer drawings with curved edges, this lower bound shows that
geometric thickness is not the same concept as thickness.</p>

<p>The following table shows what we know about lower bounds and
upper bounds for the number of layers required for complete graphs
K<sub>n</sub>.</p>

<h2>Subdivisions of Complete Graphs</h2>

<p>If one splits each edge of a complete graph (or any other graph) into
a two-edge path, the resulting subdivided graph has geometric thickness two.
The following picture shows a drawing for K<sub>8</sub>:</p>

<div align=center><img src="k8gt2.png" width=355 height=356
alt="Two-layer drawing of subdivision of K_8"></div>

<p>Interestingly, a Ramsey-theoretic argument shows that the book
thickness of subdivisions of K<sub>n</sub> is not bounded by any constant.
So, there are graphs with geometric thickness two and arbitrarily large
book thickness [Eppstein, 2001].  A very similar Ramsey-theoretic
argument, applied to graphs
formed by starting with n points and adding a new point adjacent to each
triple of the n points, shows that there are also graphs with thickness
three and arbitrarily large geometric thickness [Eppstein,
Contemp. Math. 2004].</p>

<h2>Complete Bipartite Graphs</h2>

<p>In our JGAA 2000 paper
we also investigated the geometric thickness of complete bipartite
graphs.  When a is much smaller than b, the geometric thickness of
K<sub>a,b</sub> is just a/2, but complete bipartite graphs in which both
sides are of nearly equal size are more interesting.  For
instance, here is a two-layer drawing of the complete bipartite
graph K<sub>6,6</sub>:</p>

<div align="CENTER"><img src="K66.png" width="349" height="348"
alt="Two-layer drawing of K_{6,6}"></div>

<p>K<sub>1,n</sub> and K<sub>2,n</sub> are planar (one layer), and
K<sub>3,n</sub> and K<sub>4,n</sub> always require exactly two
layers, so the first nontrivial cases are K<sub>5,n</sub> and
K<sub>6,n</sub>. K<sub>5,n</sub> requires two layers for
n&nbsp;<u>&lt;</u>&nbsp;8 and three layers for n&nbsp;<u>&gt;</u>&nbsp;11.
For 9&nbsp;<u>&lt;</u>&nbsp;n&nbsp;<u>&lt;</u>&nbsp;10 we don't
know whether two or three layers are needed. A drawing of
K<sub>5,8</sub> is below.  K<sub>6,n</sub>
requires three layers for n&nbsp;<u>&gt;</u>&nbsp;8. For
K<sub>6,7</sub> we don't know whether two or three layers are
needed.</p>

alt="Two-layer drawing of K_{5,8}"></div>

<h2>Hypercubes</h2>

<p>Below we show a two-layer drawing of a six-dimensional hypercube.
More generally the d-cube has geometric thickness at most
ceiling(d/3) [Eppstein, GD 2004].</p>

<p align="center"><img src="cube6.png" width=381 height=381

<h2>Minor-Closed Graph Families</h2>

Blankenship and Oporowski [2001,2003] showed that all proper
minor-closed graph families have bounded book thickness.
Therefore, they also have bounded geometric thickness.

<h2>Low Degree Graphs</h2>

<p>Graphs with maximum degree up to four require geometric
thickness at most two [Duncan et al., SCG 2004].  How does the geometric
thickness behave for bounded degree graphs with higher degree bounds?
Some progress has been made by [Dujmovi&#263; et al., GD 2004] who
showed that the geometric thickness is O(1) for bounded-degree interval
graphs, co-comparability graphs, and AT-free graphs, and that it is
O(log&nbsp;n) for bounded-degree bounded-treewidth graphs. Duncan [CCCG
2009] showed that the geometric treewidth is also O(log&nbsp;n) for
graphs that can be decomposed into the union of two bounded-treewidth
graphs, without degree restrictions.</p>

<p>However, Bar&aacute;t, Matou&#353;ek, and Wood [math.CO/0509150]
have shown that larger constant bounds on degree need not imply bounded
thickness for arbitrary graphs.  In particular, they use counting
arguments to prove the existence of
&Delta;-regular graphs for any &Delta;&nbsp;>&nbsp;8 with geometric thickness
&Omega;(n<sup>c</sup>) for some c&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, where c depends on
&Delta; and approachs 1/2
in the limit of large &Delta;.</p>

<h2>Computational complexity</h2>

For arbitrary graphs, testing whether the graph has thickness k is
NP-complete, even for k=2 [Mansfield, MPCPS 1983].  Testing the
geometric thickness of a particular drawing is polynomial time for
thickness two but NP-complete for higher thickness [Eppstein, SODA
2004]. Recognizing whether a graph has geometric thickness two is also
NP-complete, as is coloring graphs of geometric thickness <i>t</i>
with 4<i>t</i>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 colors [Durocher, WG 2013].


<h2>Open Problems</h2>

<ol>
<li>The complete graphs K<sub>n</sub> should require a number of
layers of the form c*n, for some constant c. What is c?</li>

<li>Similarly, what is the asymptotic number of layers needed for
K<sub>n,n</sub>?</li>

<li>If a multi-layer drawing of a graph is made in which all the
vertices have integer coordinates, how big do those integers need
to be? (For planar graphs, it is known that all coordinates can be
O(n).)</li>

<li>How large can the ratio between thickness and book thickness of a graph be,
as a function of the number of vertices in the graph?
Similarly how large can the ratio between geometric thickness and
thickness be?
The examples of Bar&aacute;t, Matou&#353;ek, and Wood [math.CO/0509150]
show that this ratio can at least approach sqrt&nbsp;n.</li>

<li>What happens if we allow restricted types of curves other than
straight line segments?  For instance, Wood [ENDM 2001] has looked at
thickness for curves with one bend that are allowed to change layers at
the bend. What if the curves can bend in a restricted way but can't
change layers?

<li>Hutchinson et al. proved that the number of edges of a <i>n</i>-vertex
graph with geometric thickness two is at most
6<i>n</i>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;18.
However, the largest number of edges that is known for an example of
such a graph is
6<i>n</i>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;19 (for all <i>n</i> at least 9, by Durocher
et al.) Which of these two is the correct bound?

<li>Determining the chromatic number of thickness-two graphs is Ringel's
famous <a
href="http://www.emba.uvm.edu/~archdeac/problems/earthmoo.htm">Earth-Moon
problem</a>.  What about the chromatic number of graphs with low
geometric thickness?
The best lower bound for Ringel's problem comes from the graph
K<sub>6</sub>+C<sub>5</sub>, which has thickness two and requires nine
colors; however this graph has 50 edges, violating a 6n-18 upper bound
on the number of edges of a geometric thickness two graph due to
Hutchinson et al.
Is there a different nine-chromatic graph with geometric thickness two?
