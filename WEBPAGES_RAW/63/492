Next couple weeks:
Binary search tree like data structures

Today:
Motivation and preliminaries

Binary search in sorted list
    test existence of search key, but better to use hash table
    nearest neighbor classification -- can't be done by hash table

What about nearest neighbor classification with dynamic data?
    adding into array and preserving sorted order not possible quickly
    need more complex data structures


Second example: plane sweep
Test whether any two line segments in input intersect, if so find a crossing
    (plane sweep approach, 33.2)
    - single crossing:
	sort list of endpoints by x-coordinates
	initialize sorted list of segments in order by y-coord of sweep point
	for each endpoint in input:
		if it's a left endpoint:
			insert in sorted list
			test for crossing with pred and with succ
		else if it's a right endpoint:
			remove from sorted list
			test for pred-succ crossing

    - list all crossings, y-coords of sweep points change order @ cross
        make priority queue of event points, ordered by x-coord
	initialize queue with all segment endpoints
	for each priority queue event:
		if it's a left endpoint:
			insert in sorted list
			add potential crossing event w/pred and succ
			remove potential pred-succ crossing event
		else if it's a right endpoint:
			remove from sorted list
			remove potential crossings w/pred and succ
			add potential pred-succ crossing
		else if it's a crossing event:
			report it
			swap order in event queue
			remove two and add two potential crossings

Data structures:
    (1) event queue: priority queues from last time
    (2) y-ordered crossing points: data structure w/ins,del,succ,pred


Basic binary search tree structure
    representation: item in each node; left and right children (no parents)
	(will later see trees with additional info per node)

    search for largest item <= x:
	def search(T,x):
		if not T:
			return None
		elif T.item > x:
			return search(T.left, x)
		elif T.item < x and T.right:
			return search(T.right, x)
		else:
			return T

    similar search for predecessor, successor, etc.

    insert x:
	search for largest item <= x
	if not found exactly, result has no right child, add new one there

    delete:
	find parent
	cases:
		0 children - remove
		1 child - splice out
		2 children - find successor (has no left), splice, replace


Analysis of random search trees
	model: insert according to random permutation

	E[height(x)] = Sum_y P(y is anc.) <= 2 H_n = O(log n)

	Equivalence to random quicksort

	Book, 12.4:
	E[height(T)] <= 3 log_2(n) + o(log n)

	Theorem (Lynch, 1965):
	E[# external nodes at level k] = 2^k/n! [n k]
	(Stirling number [n+1 k] = n[n k] + [n k-1]; [0 0]=1 [0 k]=0 [n 0]=0)

	1 0 0 0
	0 1 0 0
	0 1 1 0
	0 2 3 1
	0 6 11 6 1
	0 24 50 35 10 1

	=> bounds on length of unsuccessful search;
	   high probability bounds on max height of tree
	(both O(log n))
