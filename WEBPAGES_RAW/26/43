<p><a href="http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b01367s012/">
B01367/S012</a> has an 11c/22 replicator:</p>

<p>It also has a larger 10c/20 replicator:</p>

<p>This pattern, based on the smaller replicator, is a rake, moving
in one direction at 11c/22 and, every 22 steps, spitting out a
small c/2 glider moving in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>A different tail turns the 11c/22 replicator into a more
conventional spaceship.</p>

<p>Finite oscillators with periods that are multiples of 22 can be
made from the replicator by blocking it by small p2's. The
following example repeats with period 44.</p>

<p>Combinations of oscillators can be used to make glider guns; for
instance this p44 gun produces 11c/22 spaceships. By adjusting the
lengths of the oscillators, higher multiple-of-22 periods can also
be achieved. It seems likely that guns for simpler gliders (such as
the 3x2 or 4x2 c/2's) can be constructed similarly.</p>

"B01367/S012 p44 11c/22 gun"></a></p>

<p>A simpler pattern can be used for higher period 11c/22 spaceship
guns. Here, the period is 88.</p>

p88 11c/22 gun"></a></p>

<p>Another interesting replicator-based pattern is the following
breeder, which moves at 12c/24, at each repetition leaving behind a
replicator at right angles to its path. As the pattern evolves the
system of replicators behind the breeder forms a two-dimensional
Sierpinski triangle fractal pattern.</p>

"b01367s012-breeder.gif" width="79" height="35" alt=
"B01367/S012 12c/24 replicator breeder"></a></p>

<p>The breeder produces O(n<sup>1.585</sup>) live cells after n
generations.<p>

<p>With random initial conditions, this rule eventually develops into a
chaotic pattern in which small patches of dead cells are filled with
live oscillators or vice versa. Therefore, it seems likely that most
patterns eventually lead to a quadratic growth in the number of live
cells.  However, an explicit quadratic growth pattern remains unknown.</p>
