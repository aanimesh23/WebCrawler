<H1> Prospectus</H1></CENTER>

As has been discussed in class, you have substantial flexibility in choosing
the specific form for the content of your deliverables. Below is a list
of items that should be included in your first deliverable, a project prospectus.

<P>There is no need to select a manager and clerical support for this deliverable
nor will you be doing performance appraisals at this point. Rather you
should use this opportunity to brainstorm and get to know each other.

<HR>
<H3>
Due Date</H3>
As shown on the course web site.

<HR>
<H3>
Understanding</H3>
One of your major tasks for the current period of time is developing an
understanding of the various technologies and tasks concerned with your
project. This includes the tools and techniques that you will use in accomplishing
your task as well as the technologies that you will be extending, enhancing,
or changing.

<P>In this deliverable you should reflect your newly gained understanding
by writing an introduction to your project that highlights its various
important aspects. You should also include a description of activities
done in support of developing understanding - like interviews with the
customer, for example. (One of the best ways, of course, to gain an understanding
of a piece of software is to interview the original developer.)
<P>
<HR>
<H3>
Technical Marketing Sheet</H3>
Include a one or two page technical marketing sheet (a bit more technical
than a "sales brochure") suitable for describing your product to a technically
literate outside audience. This document should be successful in reflecting
that you really understand what problem is being solved and can articulate
how your product will add value.
<P>

Project Plan</H3>
Use the outline below in presenting your project plan.

<h2>Prospectus Presentations/Reviews.</h2>
<P>Each team must prepare a 15 minute presentation, after which we will
allow up to 5 minutes of questions. Prepare your presentation appropriately.
Your presentation should describe both your technical marketing and your
project plan.  Focus on the essential issues: the key technical goals,
challenges, and risks.  Don't spend air time on the obvious.
<UL>&nbsp;

<LI> With respect to your technical marketing plan, you can present things such
as</LI>

<UL>
<LI> the problem is being solve;</LI>
<LI> important functionality your system will provide;</LI>
<LI> why the system to be developed is important;</LI>
<LI> what process will the automated system replace;</LI>
<LI> what's the value added of your system;</LI>
<LI> what are the selling points of the particular system you will develop</LI>
<BR>(e.g., what's different about your approach and/or chosen emphasis).
</UL>

<LI> With respect to your project plan, you might consider presenting:</LI>
   <UL>
   <LI> how you will develop it (what's your development process);</LI>
   <LI> what are the risks involved;</LI>
