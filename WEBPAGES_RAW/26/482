<h1>Optimal Probabilistic Fingerprint Codes</h1>

<h2>Authored by Gabor Tardos; appeared in STOC 2003</h2>

<h2>Presented by Michael Nelson</h2>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>We construct binary codes for fingerprinting. Our codes for <i>n</i> users
that are &epsilon;-secure against <i>c</i> pirates have length
O(<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;log(<i>n</i>/&epsilon;)).This improves
the codes proposed by Boneh and Shaw whose length is approximately
the square of this length. Our codes use the full power of
randomization. This improvement carries over to works using the Boneh-
Shaw code as a primitive, e.g. to the dynamic traitor tracing scheme of
Tassa.</p>

<p>By proving matching lower bounds we establish that the length of our
codes is best within a constant factor for reasonable error
probabilities. This lower bound generalizes the bound found
independently by Peikert, Shelat, and Smith that applies to a limited
class of codes. Our results also imply that randomized fingerprint codes
over a binary alphabet are as powerful as over an arbitrary alphabet and
the equal strength of two distinct models for fingerprinting.</p>
