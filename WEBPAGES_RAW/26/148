<H1> Overview, Prerequisites, and Frequently Asked Questions </H1>

<h3>
UCI Catalog Description:</h3>

<blockquote>
The goal of this course is to provide students with an industrial-like
experience in software development. Students will undergo the
vicissitudes of developing a large-scale software system from the point
of view of all involved personnel - customer, developer, and manager.
This course is a <em> two-quarter </em> project course in which the
students specify, design, construct, test, document, and evolve a
complete software system using concepts learned in ICS 52, 121, and
141. Special emphasis is placed on the need for and use of teamwork,
management, planning, and other tools for developing and maintaining
large-scale software systems. Using techniques for formal specification
and analysis at multiple levels of abstraction are also emphasized, as
well as those for usability evaluation and evolution.  
</blockquote>

<p>
A central focus of this course is the application of the software
engineering concepts studied in ICS 121 in a significantly sized
software development project worked on in teams. This course will will
emphasize well-understood requirements, logical object-oriented design,
effective oral and written communication of concepts, and group
cooperation.  

<h3>  How does this class differ from ICS 125? </h3>

<p>  ICS 125 attempts to address all the issues associated with
team-based software development in a ten week period.  As a result the
class is very intense and very rushed during the last several weeks.
Depending on the project chosen there is little time for thoughful
analysis of requirements, examination of architectural alternatives, or
rigorous testing.  And certainly there is no time to "do another lap",
evolving the application to meet revised needs or to address shortcomings.

<p>  ICS 126 will be similar to ICS 125 in that a project will be
developed by teams of students, but there will be opportunity to spend
more time on requirements, design, and analysis.  Moreover there will
be time to go around the track again.  This second lap is a critical
learning experience:  developers will confront the consequences of
decisions they made during initial design and implementation.

<h3>  What kind of grade will I get at the end of the first quarter? </h3>

<p>
A grade of IP ("in progress") will be assigned at the end of ICS 126A.  Final 
grades will be assigned only upon completion of ICS 126A-B.  Naturally, though,
intermediate marks will be assigned so that students will know how they are
doing as the class progresses.

<h3>  Can I get credit for both ICS 125 and ICS 126A&B? </h3>

No.  Students may not get credit for both 125 and 126A-B.

<h3>  Will this class give me 2 project course credits towards the ICS degree? </h3>

Yes!  But you need to understand the ICS degree requirements.

<p>
Students entering the program in the Fall of 1997 have a <em> three-project </em>
course requirement, at least two of which must be in different ICS
"areas".  Students entering the program before FQ97 have a <em> two-project </em>
course requirement;  a close reading of upper division requirement "C" 
in the 1996-97 catalog will reveal that these two project classes must
be in <em> different </em> areas.
	
<p>
So, what does this mean for 126A & B?
	  
<p>
If you have entered before FQ97 then you cannot use 126A and 126B to satisfy
the <em> entire </em> project class requirement.  You will still need to take
one other project class from outside the software area.

<h3>  What will the projects be? </h3>

<p>
Candidate projects can come from many places:  in AY 97-98 some ICS 126
teams worked on projects that sponsoring local companies suggested.
Other teams worked on projects related to on-going research programs in
the ICS department.  Other projects may come from the students.

<p>
Choice of projects is related to many goals.

<p>
One key goal is to pick a project of appropriate size.  It must be big
enough to challenge a team of four students, but not so big as to
commandeer everyone's life!  As a result we will spend some time at the
beginning of the fall attempting to size various projects.  These
planning estimates will be revisited as the course progresses.

<p>
Another goal is to select a different project for each team.   Since
each team will be making regular project presentations to the rest of
the class, diversity of projects will enable students to learn from
experiences across a range of project topics.

<p>
Still another goal is to work on something fun and interesting!  I've
had students working on flight simulators, generating HTML pages,
linking MPEG movie frames via hypertext to other artifacts, and
building graphical program editors.  There are many opportunities....

<h3>  How will teams be composed? </h3>

Each team will have 4 or 5 people.  I will attempt to balance a team's
aggregate expertise with the project they've decided to work on.  I
will also attempt to accommodate personal preferences for teammates.



<H3> What's the Drop/Add policy?</H3>

<p>
Since ICS 126 has a strong team project orientation, it is essential
that the drop/add process be terminated early.  Therefore <em> NO drops
or adds </em> of ICS 126A will be permitted after the end of the second
week of class, unless there are truly extenuating circumstances.

<p>
Composition of the teams will be re-examined at the beginning of ICS 126B.
Similar to 126A, drops from 126B will not be permitted after the end of the
second week of Winter Quarter.

<hr>
<h1> Lecture Topics </h1>

<p>
Since 126 will not be on the tight time schedule that 125 is there will be time
for lectures on material supplementary to that in 121 and the other prerequisite
courses.  Lectures are anticipated on:
	<ul>
	<li> Teamwork and team organizations
	<li> Project management
	<li> Project cost and schedule estimation
	<li> Usability evaluation and user interface prototyping
	<li> Software architectural choice
	<li> Computer-aided software engineering tools and environments
	<li> Configuration management and version control
	<li> Distributed software engineering
	<li> Engineering of distributed applications, including distributed object technology
	</ul>
Specific choice of lecture topics will depend somewhat on the projects
chosen by the teams.  If several of the projects, for example, are
concerned with Internet applications, then lectures on protocols and
Web technologies will be included.  Similarly if most projects will be
using some particular kind of infrastructure, such as CORBA or ActiveX,
then there will be lectures on that.

<HR>
<a name="textbooks"></a>
<H1> Textbooks </H1>

<p>
Regardless of the project chosen, all students will be required to read
<em> The Mythical Man-Month</em>.  Depending on the projects chosen additional
readings from various sources may be required.

<ul>
<li> REQUIRED:
<ul>
<li>
Author:              Fred Brooks
<li>
Title:               The Mythical Man-Month, Anniversary Edition
<li>
New Price:$          24.50 
<li>
Used Price:$         18.40 
<p>
Note that this book has a lot of white space and blank pages, so it 
really will not take you long to read these chapters.

<a name="assignments"></a>
<h1> Assignments and Assessment </h1>
<P>
The project is the focus of this course and will be assessed
accordingly.  It will account for 80% of your grade; this is broken
down between deliverables, team process descriptions and updates, a
team Web page, and presentations.  The remaining 20% will be divided
among individual course logs, teamwork, individual leadership, and the
final (if any).

<P>
Their relative weighting (as a percentage of your final grade) of each part of the
project is as follows for ICS 126A (in the case where there is only a single
implementation phase  --- if there are two then these will have to be adjusted):
<P>
<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2>
<TR><td><strong> <STRONG>Assignment <TD><STRONG> Weight     </STRONG><td><strong> On-line versions </strong>
<tr><td> Prospectus and Plan  					<td> 15 <td> <a href="prospectus.html"> Prospectus </a>
<tr><td> Requirements		  					<td> 15 <td> <a href="requirements.html"> Requirements </a>
<tr><td> Architecture/Module Specifications                 <td> 25 <td> <a href="design.html"> Architecture/Design </a>
<tr><td> Implementation 						<td> 25 <td> <a href="implementation.html"> Implementation </a>
</TABLE>

<P>
Deliverables, and weighting for grading purposes, for ICS 126B will be determined later.

<p> The final examination may consist of a maintenance activity in which a
minor change will be made to your team project or a small essay.

<h3> Assignments and Due Dates</h3>
<P>
Deliverables are due at 2:00 PM on the date indicated in the team's plan.
NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.
This applies to your final system and all intermediate projects.
Since you are working in this class
as part of team, it is the team's responsibility to ensure that assignments
are turned in on time.  Normal excuses for late assignments, such as
illness, do not apply in a team setting (unless of course everyone on the
team is ill  :-)

<P>
The ICS 126A part of the project nominally consists of four major assignments.
They are equally weighted.  Variations to this may be made to accommodate
the particular needs of a given project.

<h3>``Fixed up'' Deliverables</h3>
<P>
For all deliverables, except for the last in ICS 126B 
you will also have the opportunity
to ``fix it'' based on its evaluation.  You may hand in an improved
version of a deliverable one week after that deliverable has been
graded and receive up to 50% of the points deducted on the initial
version.  The purpose of this exercise is for you to both learn how to
use the techniques and so that you do not implement something from a
bad design or specification.  As discussed above, you should keep the
same responsibilities for the improvement phase but assign new
responsibilities for the next phase.


<h3> Document Requirements</h3>
<P>
All the documents associated with the above listed phases are integral
parts of systematic software development.  Their continued, up-to-date
existence is necessary for successful system development.
<b>Do not delete</b> documents after they have been turned in.

<P>
All deliverable documents must be prepared on-line and be available as part
of your project home page..
In general, the following should be observed.
<DL ><DT>Cover "page".
<DD> Every deliverable shall have identifying information giving
<DL ><DT><DD> Project title
<DT><DD> Development phase and deliverable
<DT><DD> Date
<DT><DD> Team name/number
<DT><DD> Team members
<DT><DD> Phase manager
<DT><DD> Phase clerical person
<DT><DD> Files and locations (href's)
<P>
</DL>
<P>
<DT>Table of Contents.
<DD> Every deliverable shall include a table of contents
<DT>Specification.
<DD> The system specification (requirements, design,
module specs, code) for each deliverable shall correspond in form and
content to the outline provided for that phase.
Sections that are not necessary for this application shall be marked
``N/A''.
<DT>Minutes.
<DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied by minutes of
team meetings held during the associated period of time.
<DT>Performance Appraisals.
<DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied
by performance appraisals.  Performance appraisals shall NOT be maintained
as part of the project's web page.  A form is available at
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics126/appraisal.html"> 
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics126/appraisal.html
</a>.

<DT>Project WebPage.
<DD> The project deliverables, except as noted above,  shall be maintained
in a project homepage.  
</DL>

<H3> Course Log</H3>
<P>
During your career you will need to keep track of how you spend your time
either for you employer or to improve your own productivity.
Throughout this course, you will practice doing this by keeping a
course log recording the time you spend on all activities related to
this course.  At the beginning of each week you must hand in a copy of your log.
These logs are confidential and should be handed in independent of
your team's deliverable.  A log sheet is available at: <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics126/logform.html">
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics126/logform.html </a>.
Keep your log as part of your individual home page, but password protect it.
<hr>
<p> OPTION: 
A better way than to submit the course logs (than each week in class)
is be to have the form online in each of your home pages. Create a new one
each week, and password protect the web pages in the following
way:

<br>--save the forms in a separate directory in your public_html directory
<br>-- You place a file called .htaccess in the directory you want to protect.
It has the following sequence of commands in it:
<p>

<code>AuthUserFile <full path name of .htpasswd file>
<br>AuthName ByPassword
<br>AuthType Basic
<br>
<br>&ltLimit GET&gt
<br>require user ics126
<br>&lt/Limit&gt
</code>

<p>This means the user has to log in as ics126 and give the correct
password (which you will set) to be able to access the course log form.
You set the password in the .htpasswd file, be careful not to store the
.htpasswd file in your public_html directory.

<p>To create the .htpasswd file:

<br>run the program <kbd>htpasswd</kbd>, to create it say,

<br><kbd>htpasswd -c ~your_name/.htpasswd username</kbd>

<br>and to add a password it is

<br><kbd>htpasswd ~your_name/.htpasswd anotherusername</kbd>

<br>assuming of course that the file you pointed to from .htaccess was
~your_name/.htpasswd

<p>Remember to have both .htpasswd and .htaccess as world readable. This
should do the trick, and you will be able to restrict access to your
course log file. send in to taylor@ics and jaya@ics the password to give
access to your course log form. Keep the user name as "ics126".
If you have any problems with this, send mail to jaya@ics.uci.edu

<hr>


<P>
Each entry records the date and amount of time spent, type of entry,
and text describing the entry.  An entry is one of three types:
<UL><LI> A <i>description</i> records an activity;
<LI> An <i>explanation</i> says why something happened;
<LI> A <i>prescription</i> is a plan for something to do later.
</UL>

<p>
Most entries will be of the first type, but occasionally you should
reflect and think about what is going on.
The time column applies for descriptions of activities and record the
amount of time spent in hours, to the quarter hour.

<P>
Keep a copy of your log.
You will be marked down only for failing to hand in logs with each phase,
handing in illegible logs, giving too little detail, or
failing to keep track of time spent.  

<P>
You are especially encouraged to keep track of the kinds of errors
you make and the amount of time they consume.  The purpose of recording
these errors is so that you develop a better understanding of the
kinds of mistakes you typically make.  With that understanding you
can improve your performance in the future, by paying extra attention
to those areas in which you've had problems in the past.

<hr>
<H1> Team Composition, Activities,  and Peer Apportionment of Credit</H1>
<P>
As discussed in class, teams will be assigned on as fair a basis as
possible for the project.  The danger most students perceive in
working on projects with other students is in being saddled with (what
they think is) a "non-producer".  This is particularly true when
you don't get to choose all your teammates (the situation here).  Many
factors dictate the use of a multi-person project for this course.
You will not, after all, be able to choose your workmates in the
future.  Therefore, to alleviate your concerns and to grade you
appropriately, at the end of the term project you will be asked to
divide 100 points among the members of your project team,
corresponding to how you believe they contributed to the project as a
whole (or on a phase-by-phase basis if you wish).  In addition, each
team member will be appraised for each phase.  This ``peer
apportionment of credit'' will be used to help determine appropriate
individual grades for the project component.

<H3> Team Organization</H3>
<P>
There are several obvious dangers to group work that can be circumvented.
Ensure that there is adequate coordination among the team members.
Know each other's login names for electronic mail.
Know each other's phone numbers.
Meet <b>at least once per week</b> (outside of class lecture)
and preferably at the same,
pre-determined time each week (so as to avoid confusion).  The Discussion Section
is designed to guarantee that such meetings are possible for everyone.
Have an agenda for each meeting, which is determined by the manager.


<p>
Have a contingency plan for submitting a document on time even if
the responsible manager becomes unavailable.
You are <b>strongly</b> advised to consult weekly with the instructor/TA
about your progress, problems, questions, etc.
<P>
<h3> Meetings</h3>
<P>
Meetings are an important part of a team project.
A successful meeting requires that the meeting have a definite
purpose and associated agenda (these are the responsibility of the
phase manager) and that all decisions be recorded in minutes
(the responsibility of the phase clerical person).
<P>
The purpose of minutes is to record decisions made
and to be available for updating any team member who misses a meeting.
Each deliverable must be accompanied by agendas and minutes
for the team meetings held during the associated period of time.
I.e., keep the agenda, and the minutes, on-line as part of your project web page.
The minutes should outline
<OL><LI> agenda for the meeting
<LI> team members present and reason for any member's absence
<LI> major design decisions discussed
<LI> task assignments made
<LI> future meetings scheduled
</OL>



<HR> 
<a name="costs"></a>
<H1> Cost and Benefits</H1>

<p>
This course, like ICS 125,  will demand a lot, but I think that you may well find this
to be the most rewarding courses that you will take in your
undergraduate career.  ICS Alumni have said repeatedly that ICS 125 was
<em> the most important </em> class that they took at UCI.  The
techniques presented in class actually work and will help you in future
software development.    Since 126 "does 125"  with a "double helping"
it should be even more popular.

<p>
At the end of the class I encourge you to make copies of your
project website/notebook for each team member.  Take them with you when
you go to a job interview.  Students from past ICS 125 classes
have frequently said that it was their project notebook that 
clinched a job for them.  Some interviewers have commented that 
the quality of the process followed by the ICS 125 teams and the
quality of the product exceeds those of the production engineers
in their companies.  Since ICS 126 should be even more realistic and 
in-depth than 125 I suspect employers will be even more impressed!
