The body of contract law -- defining the way that the legal system will, or will not, enforce the promises that people make to one another -- is as complex and profound as any.  It is the foundation upon which most commercial activity (and much non-commercial activity) takes place in the "real world," and it will surely play a significant role in determining the shape of "e-commerce" in the coming years. Needless to say, this is not the forum for an extensive discussion of the many subtleties of contract doctrine.  Our focus here is on a small slice of contract doctrine: do interactions on the global electronic network pose any special contract problems, or require any change in the way we ordinarily think about contractual relationships?<P>
 Like many complicated subjects, contract law has a simple set of principles at its foundation.  Contracts are fundamentally *voluntary* exchanges, and contract law looks for evidence that the parties have MUTUALLY ASSENTED to the terms of a particular set of obligations before it will impose those obligations on them.  Anglo-American law has stylized this idea as follows:  before the law will recognize the existence of a binding contract, there must be
<blockquote>    
<TABLE>
<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN="1">1.</td><td>A definite OFFER by one party (called the "offeror"),  and<BR>
<tr><td>2.</td><td>A timely ACCEPTANCE (by the "offeree").</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></blockquote>
<P>
 Thus, if one party makes an offer -- "Pay me $500 and I will paint your living room" -- and another party accepts the offer -- "OK, that sounds like a good deal, go ahead and I'll pay you when you're done" -- the law infers that the parties have voluntarily agreed to be bound to the set of mutual obligations.<P>
In addition, there is another pre-requisite:
<blockquote>    
<TABLE>
<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>
<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN="1">3.</td><td>Some CONSIDERATION must pass between the offeree and the offeror.</TD></TR>
</TABLE></blockquote><P>
 This needs a bit of explaining.  Suppose you meet someone at a party (call her Alice), and during the conversation you discover that a few months ago she began work as a computer consultant.  "That's funny," you say, "My firm is looking for a consultant to help out with a new system we're installing. First thing tomorrow, I'm going to call our MIS Director and tell him to get in touch with you."  Alice replies "That would be terrific - thanks so much for your help." Unfortunately, you completely forget to make the call.  Have you "breached your contract"?<P>
The answer is no -- your promise to Alice is not enforceable as a binding contract.  Not because you didn't make an offer (to call the MIS Director), or that Alice didn't accept it. And it's not because your promise was not in writing; as we'll see, the legal system is prepared to enforce all sorts of contracts merely on the basis of an oral understanding. The reason this is unenforceable is that there was no *exchange* between you, no quid pro quo; Alice didn't give *you* anything of value in exchange for your promise. Without that -- without what the law calls "consideration" for your promise -- your promise is not enforceable in court.<P>
 With this basic framework in hand, let's look, in the next few messages, at common contract problems that are likely to crop up on the Net.<P>
