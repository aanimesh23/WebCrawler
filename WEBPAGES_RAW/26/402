<H2>Grasping and Fixturing</H2>

Although one version of this problem comes from
<A HREF="robot.html">robotics</A> and the other comes from
<A HREF="cam.html">manufacturing</A>, the aim of both is the same:
to construct a
placement of obstacles (robot fingers or fixtures) preventing the
movement of some part.

This paper by Marek Teichmann, at the 5th MSI Worksh. Comp. Geom.,
shows that grasping and fixturing are
related by geometric duality to problems of approximating many-faceted
convex polyhedra by
simpler shapes (previously studied for their application in
<a href="graphics.html">graphics</a>).
