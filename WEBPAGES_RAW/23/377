    <div class=section>Text</div>
    There is one required text for the course:
    <a href="http://www.mhhe.com/rosen"><i>Discrete Mathematics and its applications</i></a>,
    Fourth Edition, by Kenneth H. Rosen (McGraw-Hill 1995).
    <p>
    <div class=section>Course Grades</div>
<div class=justify>
There will be 7-8 homeworks and 7-8 quizzes.
Homeworks will be given each Tuesday and scheduled the following week.
Quizzes will be given every Thursday at the beginning of class.
There will be one midterm and a final.
The grading criteria for the course is:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Homework assignments 10%<br>
<li>Quizzes 40%<br>
<li>Midterm 20%<br>
<li>Final 30%<br>
</ul>
We will drop the two lowest quiz
scores and the two lowest homework scores in determining your
final grade.
<p>
<div class=section>Obtaining Assistance</div>
The best way to get your questions answered is by coming
to lecture, section or office hours and asking them there.
In addition, you can send email to <a href="mailto:6a-questions@ics.uci.edu"><tt>6a-questions@ics.uci.edu</tt></a>
which will automatically
forward the mail to the TAs and myself.
It is generally preferable to use this email address instead of our
personal addresses because you are likely to get an answer to
your question faster if it is sent to the three of us.
If you ask a question by email which requires a lengthy response,
we are likely to ask you to come in to discuss the answer in person.
<p>
<div class=section>Announcements</div>
Class announcements will be made in lecture and in section.
Important announcements will also be posted on the class web page.
The web page will contain the most up-to-date
course information. Any corrections or additional explanations  for
the homework
assignments will also be posted there, so please check the web page
occasionally to stay up to date.
<p>
<a name=handouts><div class=section>Handouts</div></a>
The homework solutions  and other handouts
will be made available at the lecture or on the
<a href="ics-6a-f2000.html">course webpage.</a>
<p>
<div class=section>Homework And Quizes</div>
On each Tuesday, a new homework assignment and the solution for
the previous homework will be available after lecture.
The new homework which is distributed in a given week
will cover material covered in lecture that week and will be
due the following Tuesday.
This means that when you receive a new homework assignment,
we will not have covered all of the material in lecture
necessary to do the assignment, but will have covered
everything by the end of Thursday's lecture.
A quiz covering the same material will be given in
class the following Thursday (two days, after handing out the solutions).
<p>
You should hand your homework in to class by 11:00 AM on Tuesday.
<strong> Absolutely no homework assignments will be accepted after
11:00AM </strong>.

<p>
You can pick up your graded homeworks and quizes from
the distribution center which is located in the
ICS Trailers. The office hours for the distribution center are:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Monday and Wednesday 1:00 - 4:00, Tuesday and Thursday, 10:00 - 10:50, 12:00 - 4:00<br>
</ul>
Each homework assignment and quiz will be available
by the second Tuesday after it was handed in.

<p>
<div class=section>Questions On Grading</div>
If you have a question on how any of your quizzes or homeworks were
graded, talk to the TAs, grader, or me during office hours or after section.
<p>
<div class=section>Collaboration</div>
You are allowed, and even encouraged, to discuss the solutions to
the homework with your fellow classmates.  However, you are required to
sit down and write up your own solutions independently.
In addition, you need to write down the names of any classmates with
whom you have collaborated on a given assignment, clearly indicating
that they are your collaborators.  Copying the homework assignment of
another student is considered cheating.  Keep in mind that the homework
contributes little to your final grade in comparison to the quizzes.
Thus, it is very much in your own best interest to have a thorough
understanding of the homework assignments before the quiz.
<p>
<div class=section>Academic Honesty</div>
All work done on quizzes, midterms and finals should be your own work.
Cheating on any kind of in class examination will be taken very seriously.
Any such incident will result in a letter describing the incident
which is placed in your file on campus. Depending on the severity of the
incident, the resulting grade can range from an F on the particular
examination to an automatic F in the course.
Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can result in suspension or
expulsion from the university.</div><br><br></font>
