Unfolded Polyhedra
</H2>
A common way of making models of polyhedra is to unfold the faces into a
planar pattern, cut the pattern out of paper, and fold it back up.
Is this always possible?

The image below depicts a way of making five folds in a 2-3-4 triangle,
so that it folds up into a tetrahedron.  Toshi Kato asks if you can fold
the triangle into a tetrahedron with only three folds.
It turns out that there is a unique solution, although many
tetrahedra can be formed with more folds.

polyhedron into the polyhedron itself.  It turns out that the familiar
cross hexomino pattern for folding cubes can also be used to fold three other
polyhedra with four, five, and eight sides.
