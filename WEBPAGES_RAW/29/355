<p>Check back here every day or so.  I will generally post important coursewide announcements here.  They will be listed in reverse-chronological order (i.e., newest items first).</p>

    <td><a href="ProjectGuide/Project4">Project #4</a> is now available.  Note that there will not be a fifth project &mdash; I'd rather have you be able to spend longer on this project and wrap it up early enough to have time to study for the final in mid-Week 10 &mdash; so this change has been noted in the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>W 8/7</td>
    <td>A set of "sanity-check" tests has been included in <a href="ProjectGuide/Project3">Project #3</a>.  You can use these tests to verify that your <b>lotterysets</b> module has everything it's supposed to have (i.e., functions and methods have names that are spelled correctly, etc.).  See the new section of the <a href="ProjectGuide/Project3">Project #3</a> write-up titled <i>Sanity-checking your 'lotteryset' module</i> for more details and a link to the test module.</td>

    <td>Tu 7/23</td>

    <td>W 7/17</td>
    <td>A minor bug was found in the <a href="ProjectGuide/Project2/Bumpkin.html">example Bumpkin interpreter</a>.  The IF statement had been implemented to expect the == operator to be used to check for equality, but Bumpkin uses = (a single equals sign) instead.  That's now been fixed.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>M 7/15</td>
    <td>A detailed <a href="CodeExamples">code example</a> showing a step-by-step test-driven development process and the use of the <b>unittest</b> module in the Python standard library is now available.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Th 7/11</td>
    <td>An <a href="ProjectGuide/Project2/Bumpkin.html">example Bumpkin interpreter</a> that runs in your browser is now available, so you can experiment with the language and become comfortable with it as you proceed with <a href="ProjectGuide/Project2">Project #2</a>.</td>

    <td>Tu 7/2</td>
    <td>I've added a new error message to the PURCHASE and PAYMENT commands in <a href="ProjectGuide/Project1">Project #1</a>.  Based on the documentation, both of these commands are expected to fail when given a nonpositive (i.e., zero or negative) amount, but I had no error message to express that scenario.  So I added a NONPOSITIVE_AMOUNT error message to both commands.</td>

    <td>Tu 6/25</td>
    <td>I've made a minor adjustment to the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>.  It seems I had the calendar dates wrong starting at about Week 5, which led me to quote the wrong dates for the Midterm and Final Exams in lecture this afternoon.  This has been adjusted to match my original intent.</td>

      <p>Welcome!  Please note a couple of things as we get started this quarter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first lecture will meet on Tuesday, June 25.  Lab sections will begin meeting on Thursday, June 27.  For more information about meeting times of lab sections, see the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>.  For information about lecture material and readings, see the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>.</li>
        <li>I encourage you to spend some time reading through the material on the course web site.  It will be updated periodically throughout the quarter, and there will always be an announcement here describing each update.  For now, notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>, the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>, and the <a href="ProjectGuide">Project Guide</a>, as well as a set of <a href="CodeExamples">Code Examples</a> &mdash; mostly emanating from the lectures &mdash; that will be posted throughout the quarter.</li>
        <li>For those of you planning on using your own machines for at least some of your work &mdash; and who didn't take ICS 32 with me previously &mdash; it might be worth spending some time working through <a href="ProjectGuide/Assignment0">Assignment #0</a>, which provides instructions on getting the necessary software installed and configured.  (Read the <a href="ProjectGuide">Project Guide</a> page first, for some context on the necessary software and some background on what we're going to be doing.)</li>
      </ul>
