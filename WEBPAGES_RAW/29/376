<h2> Teaching Philosophy </h2> I am your guide and collaborator in
learning. However the primary responsibility in learning rests with
you. Evaluate yourself before I do.  Use all the available
resources. Ask questions.  Writes lots of very simple programs to
verify and deepen your understanding of the various concepts. Doing
only the homeworks assignments is not sufficient. If you can't use
a concept, you don't know it. Explain the concept to friend. 
Teaching often reveals holes in understanding. Everytime you make
an error, it is an oppportunity to learn. Enjoy the process of learning.

<hr>
<h2>  Course Goals </h2>

Learn the properties and
implementation details of the fundamental data structures (arrays,
lists, queues, stacks, dictionaries, trees) that often are at
the heart of any program. Implementations will be done in Java.
Learn the elements of analysis of algorithms, including O notation.
as well as basic elements of object-oriented
design and implementation. 

<hr>
<h2> Grading </h2>

There will be approximately 4 quizzes and 8 programming
assignments. The coding assignments are all Java. Your lowest quiz
score and your lowest homework score will be dropped. Approximately,
the final, quizzes, and homework will count equally.  The final exam
will be based on the text, lecture notes, homeworks, and quizzes.
Each chapter ends with a summary. Be sure that you know every concept
discussed in the summary in the Preiss text.

 The fastest way to get questions answers is
to email either Steve or myself. Answers of general interest will be
posted on the bulletin board (ics.H22). You may also use the bulletin
board to ask classmates for appropriate help. Any form of inappropriate
help will result in an F grade in the class and a letter in your file.

<h2> Required Text </h2>
Text </strong>  <em> Data Structures and Algorithms with Object-Oriented
Design Patterns in Java </em> by Bruno Preiss.
<h2> Suggested Text </h2>
   Any book on Java that you can learn from. Many students like
<em>Core Java </em> but I like <em> The Java Programming Language 3rd edition
</em> by Ken Gosling et al.


<hr>
<h2> Java Language Notes </h2>

Lecture notes for  the Java Language are available on-line
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kibler/javacourse/java.html"> Java Notes </a>.
Please tell me if you find any errors or misrepresentations.

<h2> Homework Assignments </h2>
Homeworks are duly weekly and need to typed. No handwritten
assignments will be accepted.

<ol>
<li>  <h3>Object design</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Use Visual Cafe's IDE and write any program at all. Hand in the code.
 You may have help in using Visual Cafe, but not in writing the program.
    <li> Suppose you are design an computer implementation of a personal
telephone book. In English, provide a list of the constructors  and
methods you would expect to have. Include a sentence describing each
method/constructor. Do not write any code.  For example:  <br>
 TelephoneBook() : constructs an empty telephone directory.
We have done this in class for complex numbers as part of the design
process.

    <li> Suppose a math professor hires you to write a class for polynomials.
   As above provide in English a list of the constructors and the methods.
   Do not write any code.
  </ul>
<li> <h3> Other Peoples classes </h3>
 <ul> 
   <li> Using BufferedReader and StringTokenizer, write a program to
count the number of words in a file. Precisely define what a word is.
  <li> Use Double, TreeSet, and CurrentTimeMillis to time
sorting 100, 200, ... 12800 random doubles ( Math.random() )
Printout a table of times, times/n, times/n*logn, times/(n*n)
  <li> Using BufferedReader and Hashtable, write a program to
count the number of words of length equal to the length of your
last name in the file XX.
  </ul>
<li>  <h3> Gui Interface </h3>

<li>  <h3> Analysis </h3>    
 <ul>
   <li>  Do problems XX
   <li>  Use the linked list class provided in the Collections class
     to implement a sparse polynomial. Implement the following:
     <ol>
      <li> Poly(String s) where s has looks like 2x3+11x14 etc. <br>
          Use StringTokenizer and add "x" to the delimiter set.
       <li> void add(Poly p) adds p to the current polynomial
       <li> int degree(Poly p) returns the highest degree of the polynomial
       <li> Extra credit:  void mult(Poly p) multiplies p with current polynomial
      <li> Extra credit: double solve(P, int a, int b)  returns a solution
           to P within the range [a,b]. 
     </ol>
  </ul>
<li> <h3> Arrays   </h3>
  <ul>
     <li> Write a dynamic arrays as an array, a singly linked list, a doubly
linked list  pointer, and an array.
Time the results of adding the elements 1...1000 to it.
        


   </ul>
<li> <h3> LinkedLists  </h3>
   <ul>
     <li> Expand the program from the previous assignment to include deletion. To time
     deletion, first create an fixed array of size 1000, with the
     the integers in random order. Now you can delete elements from
each representation in the same order.
   </ul>
<li> <h3> Stacks and Queues  </h3>
<li> <h3> Ordered Lists  </h3>
  In this program you will create a book index of all the "content"
words. We will somewhat arbitrarily define a content word as one 
containing at least 7 characters.
Your program will accept a file and output
an ordered list of  word  linenumber, linenumber etc. For example
a typically output line might be:     government at lines: 15, 123, 3004

<li> <h3> Hash tables  </h3>
<li> <h3> Trees  </h3>
</ol>
