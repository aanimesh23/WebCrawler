</font></p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><font size="+2">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</font></font><p>

</p><p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The international Java community
develops and evolves Java&#8482; technology specifications using the Java Community
Process (JCP). The JCP produces high-quality specifications in "Internet
time" using an inclusive, consensus building approach that produces a specification,
a reference implementation (to prove the specification can be implemented),
and a technology compatibility kit (a suite of tests, tools, and documentation
that is used to test implementations for compliance with the specification). 
</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Experience has shown that the best
way to produce a technology specification is to gather a group of industry
experts who have a deep understanding of the technology in question and then
have a strong technical lead work with that group to create a first draft.
Consensus around the form and content of the draft is then built using an
iterative review process that allows an ever-widening audience to review
and comment on the document. </font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">This version of the JCP was developed
by Sun based on input from leading Java partners. In this version, an Executive
Committee (EC) representing a cross-section of both major stakeholders and
other members of the Java community is responsible for approving the passage
of specifications through key points of the JCP and for reconciling discrepancies
between specifications and their associated test suites. There are two ECs:
one to oversee the Java technologies for the desktop/server space (with responsibility
for the J2SE&#8482; and J2EE&#8482; specifications) and the other to oversee the Java
technologies for the consumer/embedded space (with responsibility for the
J2ME&#8482; specification). </font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">There are four major steps in this version of the JCP:
</font></p>

<ol>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">	<li><b>INITIATION</b>: A specification
targeted at the desktop/server or consumer/embedded space is initiated by
community member(s) and approved for development by the responsible EC.<br><br>

	</li><li><b>COMMUNITY DRAFT</b>
: A group of experts is formed to develop a first draft of the specification
that both the community and the responsible EC will then review. The expert
group uses feedback from the review to revise and refine the draft. At the
end of the review, the responsible EC decides if the draft should proceed
to the next step.<br><br>

	</li><li><b>PUBLIC DRAFT</b>: The draft goes
out for review by the public where anyone with an Internet connection can
read and comment on the draft. The expert group uses the public feedback
to further revise the document. Finally, the leader of the expert group sees
that the reference implementation and its associated technology compatibility
kit are completed before sending the specification to the responsible EC
for final approval.<br><br>

	</li><li><b>MAINTENANCE</b>: The completed
specification, reference implementation, and technology compatibility kit
are updated in response to ongoing requests for clarification, interpretation,
enhancements, and revisions. The responsible EC can review all proposed changes
to the specification and indicate which ones can be carried out immediately
and which will require the specification to be revised by an expert group.
Challenges to one or more tests in a specification's technology compatibility
kit are ultimately decided by the responsible EC if they cannot be otherwise
resolved. </li></font></ol>

: An agreement between Sun Microsystems and an individual that allows that
individual to serve on an Expert Group at the invitation of the Specification
Lead. There is no fee associated with the IEPA and it is valid until the
Expert Group disbands. The IEPA allows individual technical experts who do
not represent companies or organizations to participate on Expert Groups. 
</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><b>Executive Committee (EC)</b>:
The Members who guide the evolution of the Java technologies. The EC represents
a cross-section of both major stakeholders and other Members of the Java

: A Specification that defines a baseline API set that provides a foundation
upon which applications, other APIs, and Profiles can be built. There are
currently three Platform Edition Specifications: J2SE, J2EE, and J2ME. </font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><b>Profile Specification (Profile)</b>
: A Specification that references one of the Platform Edition Specifications
and zero or more other JCP Specifications (that are not already a part of
a Platform Edition Specification). APIs from the referenced Platform Edition
must be included according to the referencing rules set out in that Platform
Edition Specification. Other referenced specifications must be referenced
in their entirety. </font></p>

company or organization) must be a Java Community Process Member. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">One or more Members can initiate
a request to develop a new Specification, or carry out a significant revision
to an existing one, by sending a JSR to the PMO. The JSR should follow the
template available at the JCP Web Site. The JSR serves to identify the Members
making the request (the sponsors), a Specification Lead, and the initial
members of the Expert Group. It will also describe the proposed Specification,
the reason(s) for developing or revising it, the primary target Java Platform
Edition, an estimated development schedule, and any preexisting documents,
technology descriptions, or implementations that might be used as a starting
point. Any JSR under consideration can be withdrawn by its sponsors without
explanation at any time prior to the completion of the JSR approval vote
(see section 1.3) upon request by the initiator(s) to the PMO. </font></p>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="1.1.1"><h4>1.1.1 REVISE EXISTING SPECIFICATIONS</h4></a>

</font><p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Existing Specifications, along with
their associated RIs and TCKs, are maintained by a designated Maintenance
Lead using the processes described in section 4 of this document. Maintenance
Leads (and their host company or organization) are expected to assume long
term ownership of their Specification, RI, and TCK with due respect of the
will of the Java Community Members with regard to evolution. This means that
a Maintenance Lead will automatically be the Spec Lead for all significant
revisions to their Specification going forward but he or she will not have
the exclusive right to decide when a significant revision will take place.
That will be decided by the EC in response to a revision JSR that can be
initiated by any Java Community Member (or Members). The only provision is
that the initiator(s) should make a reasonable effort to get some of the
members of the previous Expert Group to join the revision effort. </font></p>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="1.1.2"><h4>1.1.2 PROTECT THE INSTALLED BASE AND GUARD AGAINST FRAGMENTATION</h4></a>

</font><p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Changes to the Java programming language,
the Java virtual machine (JVM), the Java Native Interface (JNI), packages
in the "java.*" space, or other packages delivered as part of J2SE, have
the potential to seriously disrupt the installed base if carried out inconsistently
across the Platform Editions. In order to protect the installed base, any
such changes can only be accepted and carried out within a UJSR for J2SE. 
</font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In order to guard against fragmentation,
new Platform Edition Specifications will not substantially duplicate existing
Platform Editions or Profiles. </font></p>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="1.1.3"><h4>1.1.3 PROFILES AND API SPECIFICATIONS TARGET CURRENT PLATFORM EDITIONS</h4></a>

</font><p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">All new or revised Specifications
must be compatible with the most recent versions of the targeted Platform
Edition Specifications. In order to achieve this, all UJSRs to define new
Profile Specifications, or revise existing Profile Specifications, must reference
the latest version of the Platform Edition Specification they are based upon. 
</font></p>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a name="1.1.4"><h4>1.1.4 J2ME PROFILES AND J2ME BUILDING BLOCKS </h4></a>

</font><blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><b>definition - J2ME Building Block (Building Block)</b>
: A subset of one or more APIs defined in the J2SE or J2EE Platform Edition
Specifications. The J2ME Platform Edition Specification is a collection of
Building Blocks. J2ME Profile Specifications can build up desired functionality
by combining new API sets with existing Building Blocks. </font></blockquote>

<p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">J2ME Profiles will normally be based
upon the existing Java virtual machine and language Specifications. When
such profiles also need to include subsets of J2SE and/or J2EE functionality,
they will reference J2ME Building Blocks. </font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Building Blocks are created and revised
within the UJSR for the J2ME Platform Specification. It is likely that different
J2ME Profiles will require different J2SE/J2EE subsets. For example, different
categories of devices may need different subsets of the "java.net" package.
In order to accommodate this, no fundamental restrictions are placed upon
the number of times or ways in which J2SE/J2EE functionality can be packaged
into J2ME Building Blocks. </font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Building Blocks can be proposed in
a UJSR for the J2ME Specification. However, it is recognized that the consumer
and device marketplaces can change very rapidly in comparison to the desktop
and server marketplaces. The definition of new Building Blocks (as well as
the revision of existing blocks) may need to be carried out very quickly
in order for some J2ME Profiles to keep up with changing market needs. In
the interest of speed, J2ME Building Blocks may also be defined and revised
within the JCP Maintenance Cycle (see section 4.2) for the J2ME Specification.
 </font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Expert Groups that need to quickly
create or update a J2ME Building Block should approach the Maintenance Lead
for the J2ME Platform Edition Specification with their requests. The J2ME
Maintenance Lead, after consultation with both the J2ME Expert Group and
the Maintenance Lead(s) of the Platform Edition(s) the block is to be derived
from, may propose the new Building Block as part of a maintenance update
to the J2ME specification. Note that the EC can require any Building Block
proposed as part of the Maintenance Cycle to be defined in a major revision
to the J2ME Specification (see section 4.2.2). </font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">If the Maintenance Lead declines
a Building Block request, the requesting Expert Group has the options of
initiating a UJSR for J2ME (which may be time consuming) or creating the
needed APIs in any namespace not reserved for use by existing Platform Edition
Specifications.  </font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">In exceptional circumstances, the
J2ME Specification may define J2ME Building Blocks for use with special classes
of devices that can only implement subsets of the Java virtual machine or
language Specifications. Such Building Blocks can be defined and approved
only within a UJSR for J2ME. They cannot be defined using the Maintenance
Cycle because proposals for Building Blocks for these special classes of
devices must be subject to the widest possible review. </font></p>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">When a JSR is approved, the PMO will
notify the identified Spec Lead to form the Expert Group. If the Member contributing
the Spec Lead withdraws from the Community before the JSR is approved, the
PMO will request the initial Expert Group to choose a replacement from among
themselves who is willing to take on the duties defined in this document
(including taking responsibility for the RI and TCK, working towards the
estimated schedule given in the JSR, and assuming the position of Maintenance
Lead as described in section 4). </font></p>

<p>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">There is no size limit on the Expert
Group. The Spec Lead may add additional Experts at any time provided the
existing Expert Group is consulted first. New members may be added, for example,
to increase diversity of opinion. A Spec Lead recruits new Experts by approaching
other Members directly and working with them to identify an expert and bring
him or her into the Expert Group. Individual experts can be brought into
the Expert Group if they sign an IEPA. </font></p>

and follow whatever working style it finds most productive and appropriate
as long as it is compatible with the JCP. Use of the Internet is encouraged.
E-mail exchanges on mailing lists established for the use by the Expert Group,
along with conference calls and group meetings, have been used by past Expert
Groups to discuss and resolve issues raised as the draft evolves. In-person
group meetings are useful but they tend to slow down work considerably due
to the need to coordinate schedules. </font></p>

Group at any time. When this happens, the Spec Lead may approach the Member
who originally contributed the Expert and work with them to find a replacement.
If no replacement is offered, the Spec Lead may recruit a replacement from
another Member if desired. If the departing Expert is the Spec Lead, the
Expert Group should choose one of their members as the new Spec Lead provided
he or she is willing to take on all of the responsibilities defined in this

acting in ways that advance the work of the Expert Group. These concerns
should be brought to the attention of the Spec Lead and/or the EC as quickly
as possible so they may be proactively addressed and resolved. The Expert
Group is expected to make a reasonable effort to resolve any such issues
among themselves. If a 2/3 majority of the members of the Expert Group find
that a Spec Lead is being unresponsive, and the Spec Lead does not work to
resolve the situation in a timely manner, the EC may direct the PMO to ask
the Member who provided the Spec Lead to provide a replacement. </font></p>

is a revision of an existing Specification, the Change Log kept by the Maintenance
Lead (see section 4). Additional input can be obtained from discussions with

	</li><li>
Except where noted otherwise in this document, EC ballots are approved if
(a) a majority of the votes cast are "yes" votes, and (b) a minimum of 5
"yes" votes are cast. Ballots are otherwise rejected. 	</li><li>"No" votes must be accompanied by an explanation along with changes (if any) that are necessary to change the vote to "yes".
	</li><li>It is highly recommended that abstentions be accompanied by comments.
	</li><li>When a failed EC ballot results in the closing of a JSR, at least 1 month must pass before the JSR can be reinitiated.
	</li><li>
EC ballots to approve UJSRs for new Platform Edition Specifications or UJSRs
for J2SE that propose changes to the Java language, are approved if (a) at
least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast are "yes" votes, (b) a minimum
of 5 "yes" votes are cast, and (c) Sun casts one of the "yes" votes. Ballots
are otherwise rejected. 	</li><li>EC ballots to override a first-level decision on a TCK challenge
are approved if (a) at least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast are
"yes" votes, and (b) a minimum of 5 "yes" votes are cast. 	</li><li>An item listed in an Item Exception Ballot will be deferred to
the next JSR if at least one-third of the EC Members cast "no" votes for
that item. </li></font></ol>
