<h1>
On the Complexity of Delaunay Triangulations on Manifolds
</h1>

<h2>Nina Amenta (UC Davis)</h2>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
Even more than most spatial data structures,
the Delaunay triangulation suffers from the "curse of dimensionality".
A classic theorem of McMullen says that the worst-case complexity
of the Delaunay triangulation of a set of <I>n</I> points in dimension
<I>d</I> is &theta;(<I>n</I><sup>&lceil;<I>d</I>/2&rceil;</sup>).
The point sets constructed to realize this exponential bound are
distributed on one-dimensional curves.
What about distributions of points on manifolds of dimension
1 &lt; <I>p</I> &le; <I>d</I>?&nbsp;
<P>
We consider sets of points distributed nearly uniformly on a polyhedral
surfaces of dimension <I>p</I>,
and find that their Delaunay triangulations
have complexity O(<I>n</I><sup>(<I>d-k</I>+1)/<I>p</I></sup>),
with <I>k</I> being the ceiling of (<I>d</I>+1)/(<I>p</I>+1),
and we show that this bound is tight.
