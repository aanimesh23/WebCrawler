<h3>Formal Bio</h3>

<p>
Here is a formal biography, suitable for talks and other
announcements:
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px">
Paul Dourish is a Professor of Informatics in the Donald Bren
School of Information
and Computer Sciences at UC Irvine, with courtesy appointments in
Computer Science and Anthropology. He teaches in the Informatics
program and in the interdisciplinary graduate program in Arts
Computation and Engineering.
His primary research interests lie at the intersection
of computer science and social science; he draws liberally
on material from computer science, science and technology studies,
cultural studies, humanities, and social sciences in order to
understand information technology as a site of social and cultural
production. In 2008, he was elected to the CHI Academy in recognition
of his contributions to Human-Computer Interaction.

He is the author of
"Where the Action Is: The Foundations of Embodied
Interaction" (MIT Press, 2001), which explores how
phenomenological accounts of action can provide an alternative to
traditional cognitive analysis for understanding the embodied
experience of interactive and computational systems. With Genevieve
Bell, he is the author of
"Dividing a Digital Future: Mess and Mythology in Ubiquitous
Computing"
(MIT Press, 2011), which examines the social and cultural aspects of
the ubiquitous computing research program.

Before coming to UCI, he was a Senior Member of
Research Staff in the Computer Science Laboratory of Xerox PARC; he
has also held research positions at Apple Computer and at Rank Xerox
EuroPARC.
He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from University College, London,
and a B.Sc. (Hons) in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science
from the University of Edinburgh.
