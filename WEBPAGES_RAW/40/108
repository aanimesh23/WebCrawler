<P>
The software community has long been awaiting the public release of the
draft of the updated Capability Maturity Model for
Software. In the first public presentation after the model's release,
members of the CMMI project will talk about the details of the
new model (termed the CMMI-SW/SE) and appraisal methods, and changes
from version 1.1.
Information on how to obtain the new model and appraisal documentation
will be provided.

<P>
The CMMI project is a collaborative effort sponsored by the Office of
the Secretary of Defense/Acquisition and Technology
(OSD/A&T), with participation by government, industry, and the Software
Engineering Institute (SEI). The project's objective
is to develop a capability maturity model integrated product suite that
provides industry and government with a set of integrated
products to support process and product improvement. The project's
outputs include integrated model(s), assessment method(s),
and training materials.


<P>

<MMI project's objective is to improve the usability of the CMM
technology in a wider set of disciplines than simply
software. The concept calls for use of common terminology, common
components and rules for constructing capability models,
to reduce the training and process improvement effort needed by users of
multiple disciplines. In the initial phase, the scope of
the CMMI project is restricted to the most needed disciplines: software
engineering and systems engineering. The initial set of Capability Models 
to be produced include:

<DL>
<DD><LI>Software CMM (in both staged and continuous representations)</LI></DD>
<DD><LI>Systems Engineering CMM</LI></DD>
<DD><LI>Software and Systems Engineering CMM</LI></DD>
</DL>
</UL>

<P>
The public release of the draft is your opportunity to provide comments 
of the new structure and content of the CMM.
