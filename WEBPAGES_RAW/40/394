<h1>
Graph Algorithms in PEM: Part II
</h1>

<h2>presented by Nodari Sitchinava</h2>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
<p>
This is the second part in the two part series on graph 
algorithms in the Parallel External Memory model.  I will present 
algorithms for finding connected and bi-connected components, minimum 
spanning trees and ear decomposition
in graphs; tree contraction, expression tree evaluation and lowest 
common ancestor queries on trees. All these solutions use Euler tour 
technique as the building block just like in the PRAM algorithms. 
Therefore, I'll review this technique and simple problems one can solve 
with it in parallel.
<p>
This is joint work with Lars Arge and Michael Goodrich.
