This talk will focus on a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) 
Phase II effort that developed product line and supplier management
practices for insertion into the processes that organizations are 
using to develop/acquire software and systems. These practices are
becoming increasingly important as organizations try to figure out 
how to implement changes to their business practices that have been 
fostered by the increased use of COTS, outsourcing and open systems. 
This SBIR's aim was to make product line, architecture and software 
reuse concepts a natural part of the processes organizations like 
yours use to develop systems and software according to the Systems, 
Software and Software Acquisition Capability Maturity Models 
(SE-CMM, SW-CMM and SA-CMM). The talk will start by providing background
on the SBIR effort, its motivation and what it has accomplished to date.
It will then summarize its Phase I and Phase II findings, conclusions 
and recommendations. Finally, the talk will describe the best processes/
practices that RCI has developed based upon these results and inputs 
from a market survey and six process assessments. The talk will conclude
with a stimulating question and answer session.
