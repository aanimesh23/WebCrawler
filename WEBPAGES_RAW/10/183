<p>
Informatics and computer science professor <strong>Alfred Kobsa</strong> will co-chair the 8th Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2014), held Oct. 6-10 in Silicon Valley&#8217;s Foster City. The conference is the premier international forum for the presentation of new research results, systems and techniques in the broad field of recommender systems. Such systems, as part of broader information filtering system networks, attempt to predict user preferences and ratings for items by exploiting users&#8217; past behaviors. Their use has surged in popularity in recent years. 
</p>
<p>
According to the <a href="http://recsys.acm.org/">website</a>, the conference &#8220;will bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their latest results and identify new trends and challenges in providing recommendation components in a range of innovative application contexts.&#8221; Netflix&#8217;s chief product officer Neil Hunt will deliver the keynote speech, titled &#8220;Quantifying the Value of Better Recommendations.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Kobsa praised Silicon Valley as an ideal location for RecSys 2014, saying that it &#8220;allows local high-tech industry to learn about the most recent research results in recommender technology.&#8221; Attracting local industry has proved successful: Tickets to the conference sold out before the early registration deadline.

<p>
Computer science chair <strong>Alex Nicolau</strong> and professor <strong>Alex Veidenbaum</strong> have each been published in the 25th anniversary volume of the International Conference on Supercomputing. The volume is a collection of author retrospectives for the best papers published in the first 25 years of the conference &#8212; the Association for Computing Machinery's flagship conference in high-performance computing. Thirty-five papers were selected for their impact on the field, out of the approximately 1000 papers published in the first 25 years of the conference. 
</p>
<p>
Nicolau&#8217;s paper &#8220;A Global Resource-Constrained Parallelization Technique,&#8221; co-authored with Kemal Ebcio&#287;lu and originally published in 1989, helped to innovate the obstacle-ridden process of automatic parallelization of arbitrary sequential code. In their retrospective on the paper, Nicolau and Ebcio&#287;lu remark, &#8220;Automatic parallelization of arbitrary sequential code remains an exciting and active area as of today, and promising research and industry efforts continue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Veidenbaum&#8217;s paper &#8220;Compiler-Directed Data Prefetching in Multiprocessors with Memory Hierarchies,&#8221; co-authored with Edward H. Gornish and Elana D. Granston, was the first paper on compiler-managed data prefetching for multiprocessor systems with caches. Prefetching is used to reduce large memory access times. The group explains in their retrospective that compiler-prefetching algorithms used in memory management have not changed much since the paper&#8217;s original publishing in 1990. They ask: &#8220;Are there better ways to do it for today's hardware?&#8221;

Three ICS professors have received a Google Faculty Research Award as part of Google&#8217;s biannual open call for proposals in computer science, engineering and related fields. Computer science Chancellor&#8217;s Professor <strong>Pierre Baldi</strong>, informatics and computer science professor <strong>Alfred Kobsa</strong> and informatics professor <strong>Gloria Mark</strong> join several other ICS faculty who have received the award in recent years. 
</p>
<p>
As part of Google&#8217;s mission to &#8220;organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,&#8221; Faculty Research Awards identify and support faculty pursuing research of mutual interest at internationally renowned universities. The award is an unrestricted gift, and is typically funded at the amount needed to support one graduate student for one year.
</p>
<p>
Baldi received $65,000 for his proposal, &#8220;Deep Learning and Dropout.&#8221; The proposal studies the properties of dropout &#8212; a recently introduced deep learning approach with applications in computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing &#8212; and seeks to develop optimized randomization strategies and algorithms for deep learning, to be applied to challenging problems in the natural sciences and other areas.
</p>
<p>
Kobsa received $60,000 for his proposal, &#8220;Predicting People&#8217;s Privacy Preferences for Ubiquitous Personal Data Disclosure,&#8221; which will investigate the predictability of user privacy preferences in a ubiquitous personal data disclosure scenario. In a world where apps and websites increasingly ask users to make privacy decisions, predicted privacy preferences may allow for a balance between desired privacy and personal data disclosure.
</p>
<p>
Mark&#8217;s proposal, &#8220;In Situ Precision-tracking of Online Behavior: A Comprehensive View of Focus, Mood and Context,&#8221; garnered $64,000. Her work seeks to understand how people's focus, mood and stress change while using digital media in a real-world context, through precision tracking using wearable sensors and other methods.

<p>
A team of ICS undergrads garnered an honorable mention at the Association for Computing Machinery&#8217;s 
<a hre="http://icpc.baylor.edu/" href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/">International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals</a>
held in Ekaterinburg, Russia in late June. The team known as UCI Constructors &#8212; consisting of 
<strong>Nick Alajat</strong>, <strong>Alan Castro</strong> and <strong>Michael Cappe</strong> 
&#8212; finished 88th out of 122 teams, beating out fellow North American competitors UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University, among others.
</p>
<p>
Computer science senior lecturer <strong>Richard Pattis</strong>, who sponsored the team, pointed out that UCI Constructors was the first UCI team in over a decade to qualify for the world finals. &#8220;These students resurrected competitive programming at UCI,&#8221; Pattis declared.
</p>
<p>
During a five-hour span, international teams tackled 12 difficult programming questions. The UCI team was able to solve one problem, while the winning team from Russia&#8217;s St. Petersburg State University solved seven.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The World Finals were just as difficult as we expected them to be,&#8221; explained <strong>Gio Borje</strong>, coach of UCI Constructors and chair of UC Irvine&#8217;s ACM chapter. &#8220;Relative to other West Coast teams, UC Irvine had a great start at the beginning of the competition by solving the first problem faster than the others, but eventually the other teams caught up.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
Apart from competing, the team was able to squeeze in some sightseeing and tour the Iset River in Ekaterinburg. 
</p>
<p>
UCI Constructors had 
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/spotlight/spotlight_uci_constructors_acm.php">taken second place</a> 
in ICPC&#8217;s Southern California Regional last year. This year&#8217;s tournament starts up again soon, with the Southern California Regional taking place at Riverside Community College Nov. 8.

<p>
Professor <strong>Ramesh Jain</strong> has recently published a new textbook on multimedia computing. Co-written with Gerald Friedland, director of audio and multimedia research at the International Computer Science Institute (a private research lab affiliated with UC Berkeley), the book is simply titled 
<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Multimedia-Computing-Gerald-Friedland/dp/0521764513">Multimedia Computing</a></i>.
</p>
<p>
The textbook presents emerging techniques in multimedia computing, treating each medium &#8212; audio, images, text, etc. &#8212; as a strong component of the complete exchange of information. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The multimedia field needed a textbook,&#8221; states Mubarak Shah, a professor at the University of Central Florida, in his back-cover blurb for the book, &#8220;and it is finally here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Jain and Friedland introduce the fundamentals of multimedia computing, describing the properties of perceptually encoded information; presenting common algorithms and concepts for handling it; and outlining the typical requirements for emerging applications that use diverse information sources. Designed for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate courses, the book also serves as an introduction for engineers and researchers interested in understanding the elements of multimedia and their role in building specific applications.

<p>
Informatics professor <strong>Andr&#233; van der Hoek</strong> and postdoctoral scholar <strong>Thomas LaToza</strong> have received a $1.4 million grant over four years from the National Science Foundation for their research into what they have termed &#8220;crowdprogramming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Where crowdsourcing leverages the power of mass individual input to complete tasks that were previously too labor-intensive to be feasible or even possible, van der Hoek and LaToza propose applying those same principles to software development. Their research will address the fundamental question of how the nature of software affects what may and may not be possible in terms of crowdsourcing.
</p>
<p>
In their NSF-funded project, the pair will develop theoretical understandings of crowd programming in terms of whether it can be achieved, in which form, under what conditions and with which benefits and drawbacks; and also create a publicly available crowdsourcing platform, CrowdCode, that will offers a tool set specifically designed to address the intricacies of crowdprogramming.

(RWJF) to create a network of researchers, scientists, companies and others to catalyze the use of personal health data for the public good.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://hdexplore.calit2.net/">The Health Data Exploration Project</a>, 
a multi-campus collaboration led by the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2), seeks to establish a network that will &#8220;bring together companies that collect and store personal health data, captured through the use of wearable devices, smartphone apps and social media, with researchers who mine these data for patterns and trends and other strategic partners,&#8221; according to a

<p>
Intel Labs has awarded informatics and computer science professor <strong>Alfred Kobsa</strong> a $70,000 grant for his research on users&#8217; privacy decision-making in the context of mobile and ubiquitous computing. 
</p>
<p>
Computer users are increasingly asked to make privacy decisions, but research has shown that such decisions are cumbersome and difficult. Kobsa&#8217;s research proposes a &#8220;privacy adaptation procedure&#8221; that predicts users&#8217; decisions through machine learning, and sets personal default privacy preferences accordingly. 
</p>
<p>
The research is in the vein of Intel&#8217;s &#8220;context-aware&#8221; computing&#8212;in which devices anticipate user needs and desires and help fulfill them before users ask.
</p>
<p>
Kobsa&#8217;s proposed &#8220;privacy adaptation procedure&#8221; could allow Intel to act as an information broker between the user and the app developer. This information broker could provide privacy decision support in two ways: by informing the app about the users&#8217; privacy preferences, which the app can then use to determine permissible requests; and by providing a safe subset of the users&#8217; personal information to the app without user intervention, based on its predictions about the users&#8217; disclosure preferences. The research maintains that in either case, the user should choose the level of automation.

</div>
Informatics professor <strong>Crista Lopes</strong> has published a book titled <i>Exercises in Programming Style</i>, available in June 2014. Published by Chapman and Hall and CRC Press, the book helps readers understand the various ways of writing programs and designing systems, using a simple computational task &#8212; term frequency &#8212; to illustrate different programming styles. Written for anyone who regularly practices programming, the book is designed for use in conjunction with code provided on an online repository.
<p>
The book contains 33 different styles for writing the term-frequency task, grouped into nine categories: historical, basic, function composition, objects and object interactions, reflection and metaprogramming, adversity, data-centric, concurrency and interactivity.
</p>
<p>
Computer scientist James Noble of Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, has hailed the book as &#8220;the most important book on programming in the last 20 years.&#8221; Industry veteran and IBM Fellow Grady Booch calls it &#8220;an instant classic.&#8221;

Informatics professor <strong>Gloria Mark</strong>&#160;also earned a Best Paper Award. Her paper &#8220;'Narco'&#8221; Emotions: Affect and Desensitization in Social Media during the Mexican Drug War," co-authored with Andres Monroy-Hernandes and Munmun de Choudhury, both of Microsoft Research,&#160;found that tweets can reveal the desensitized emotions of a society that is experiencing violence during a war &#8212; in this case, the Mexican drug 
war.</p>
<p>Mark also received two Honorable Mention Awards for her papers, &#8220;Bored Mondays &amp; Focused Afternoons: The Rhythm of Attention &amp; Online Activity in the Workplace,&#8221; and &#8220;Stress and Multitasking in Everyday College Life: An Empirical Study of Online Activity.&#8221;&#160;&#8220;Bored Mondays &amp; Focused Afternoons,&#8221; co-authored with Microsoft researchers Shamsi T. Iqbal, Mary P. Czerwinski and Paul R. Johns, explores engagement in workplace activities by presenting a framework of how engagement and challenge in work relate to focus, boredom and rote work. &#8220;Stress and Multitasking in Everyday College Life,&#8221; co-authored with ICS graduate student <strong>Yiran Wang</strong> and education graduate student Melissa Niiya, reports on multitasking among Millennials who grew up with digital media, with a focus on college students.</p>
<p>
A research team comprising associate professor <strong>Gillian Hayes</strong>, assistant professor <strong>Melissa Mazmanian</strong>, graduate student <strong>Lynn Dombrowski</strong> and former postdoctoral scholar <strong>Amy Voida</strong>, received an Honorable Mention Award for their paper &#8220;Shared Values/Conflicting Logics: Working Around E-Government Systems,&#8221; which provides an analytic framework for exploring value tensions as values are enacted in practice &#8212; the result of fieldwork conducted at a social services site where the workers evaluate citizens&#8217; applications for food and medical assistance submitted via an e-government system.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Chancellor's Professor <strong>Pierre Baldi</strong> was part of a team whose study was featured in the December 2013 issue of the life science journal <i>Cell</i>. Baldi, director of the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics, played a key role in the study, collecting and analyzing highly complex genetic data.
</p>
<p>
Titled &#8220;Reprogramming of the Circadian Clock by Nutritional Challenge,&#8221; the paper reveals a surprising connection between diets and gene oscillation, finding that a high-fat diet (HFD) generates a profound reorganization of specific metabolic pathways, leading to disruption of the normal circadian cycle regulated by the liver clock. 
</p>
<p>
The research also demonstrates that the nutritional challenge specifically, and not the development of obesity, causes reprogramming of the liver clock. This indicates that the reprogramming takes place independent of the state of obesity and that the effects of diet on the liver clock are reversible.

The <a href="http://www.rwjf.org/en/about-rwjf/our-mission.html">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</a> (RWJF) has published a report titled 
&#8220;<a href="http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/reports/2014/rwjf411080">Personal Data for the Public Good: New Opportunities to Enrich Understanding of Individual and Population Health</a>,&#8221; to which ICS associate adjunct professor <strong>Judith Gregory</strong> and assistant project scientists <strong>Matthew Bietz</strong> and <strong>Scout Calvert</strong> contributed. The report examines attitudes toward personal health data from the individuals who self-track personal data; the companies designing self-tracking devices, apps, or services; and the researchers who might use the data.
</p>
<p>
The report is a culmination of research that comes out of the <a href="http://www.calit2.net/hdexplore/index.html">Health Data Exploration</a> project, a multi-campus collaboration led by the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) with support from RWJF &#8212; the nation&#8217;s largest health-focused philanthropic organization. Key findings include: high willingness of individuals to share self-tracked data for research with assured privacy; how current methods of informed consent are challenged by the use and reuse of personal health data in research; and researcher enthusiasm for personal health data tempered by concern for its validity and the lack of standardization of devices.

The National Science Foundation has awarded a grant to Bren Professors 
<strong>Gary Olson</strong> and <strong>Judith Olson</strong> 
for their project &#8220;Micro-Analytics of Collaboration in Distributed Work: What Makes Collaboration Work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The study is a four-phase examination of the micro-processes of collaborative document creation to identify what processes and tool features ensure a high-quality end product &#8212; and to determine what new features might contribute to more successful collaborations. Distributed work has become ubiquitous in industry as well as in the sciences, but, as the project abstract notes, current theories of collaborative work were generated when technology-supported distributed work was less common. With the help of nearly $397,000 in NSF funding, the Olsons will expand these theories to include the collaboration patterns when people use new tools and cope with the challenges of being distant.

Professors <strong>Michael Carey</strong> and <strong>Chen Li</strong> have received $750,000 from the National Science Foundation and nearly $400,000 from corporations &#8212; including Google, Oracle and HTC &#8212; to continue the development of their Big Data system, AsterixDB.
</p>
<p>
Carey, Li and UCI project scientist <strong>Vinayak Borkar</strong> developed the system in collaboration with Vassilis J. Tsotras, a professor at the University of California, Riverside. AsterixDB promises to be the most versatile among platforms aimed at managing Big Data; the open source software is now available for free download at 
<a href="http://asterix.ics.uci.edu">http://asterix.ics.uci.edu</a>.
</p>
<p>
The AsterixDB engine operates on a &#8220;shared nothing&#8221; architecture, in which each computer node is independent and self-sufficient. Its distinct advantages come by adding management of semi-structured data (data not organized in the traditional tabular form), supporting a variety of data types (e.g., spatial and temporal as well as textual and numeric data), and borrowing techniques from parallel databases that increase the speed and scale at which it can operate.

</p>
<p>
Sadowski and Zeller, students in professor <strong>Pierre Baldi</strong>&#8217;s group and researchers at the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics, developed a pipeline for translating protein phosphorylation status from rat primary lung cells to human primary lung cells after subjecting cells to various stimuli consisting of known drugs and chemicals. Their pipeline consisted of two parts: an artificial neural network; and a statistical analysis that aggregated evidence from the replicated measurements. They placed second out of 13 teams and were awarded travel-cost reimbursement to the 2013 sbv IMPROVER Symposium in Athens, Greece, where they presented their findings.

Professors <strong>Judith Olson</strong> and <strong>Gary Olson</strong> have 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Together-Apart-Collaboration-Human-Cenered/dp/1608450503">published a new book</a>, 
titled <em>Working Together Apart: Collaboration over the Internet</em>. Published by Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers, the Olsons&#8217; new offering reviews the latest insights into how teams work together when they are not in the same location. 
</p>
<p>
Guided by a framework they developed during two decades of research on this topic, the professors organize a series of factors they have found to differentiate between successful and unsuccessful distributed collaborations. They then review the kinds of technology options that are available today, focusing more on types of technologies rather than specific instances. They describe a database of geographically distributed projects they have studied and introduce the Collaboration Success Wizard, an online tool for assessing past, present, or planned distributed collaborations. The book closes with a set of recommendations for individuals, managers, and those higher in the organizations who wish to support distance work.

These abilities improve driving efficiency and safety and are the first steps towards an automated driving network. But what happens if the communication network fails? Or worse, is hacked into?
</p>
<p>
Regan&#8217;s article, &#8220;<a href="http://www.uctc.net/access/43/access43_almanac.shtml">Vehicular ad hoc Networks: Storms on the Horizon</a>,&#8221; describes the advantages and challenges these networks present. While the latest technology turns both cars and even pedestrians into nodes on the network, issues of security, privacy and liability continue to be major barriers to broad implementation.

Two members of the Department of Informatics have received a National Science Foundation grant for 
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1321065&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">their inquiry</a> 
into how the maker movement is changing material culture, production and creativity. Postdoctoral scholar <strong>Silvia Lindtner</strong> and assistant project scientist <strong>Garnet Hertz</strong> have been awarded $500,000 for their work studying makerspaces in China, New York City and San Francisco.
</p>
<p>
Their project uses ethnographic investigation to examine how DIY (Do-It-Yourself) making as a practice, and makerspaces as physical sites, contribute to the development of technical, economic and social innovation.

<p>
Professor <b>Geoffrey C. Bowker</b> is part of a team that has earned a $1.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation&#8217;s EarthCube awards program. A partnership between the NSF&#8217;s Directorate for Geosciences and Office of Cyberinfrastructure, EarthCube awards seek &#8220;to greatly increase the productivity and capability of researchers and educators working at the frontiers of Earth system science,&#8221; according to the NSF website.
</p>
<p>
The grant awarded to Bowker&#8217;s team was given under EarthCube&#8217;s Building Blocks category. Titled &#8220;A Broker Framework for Next Generation Geoscience,&#8221; the project, sponsored by the University of Colorado, Boulder, brings together an accomplished team of geoscientists, social scientists, cyberinfrastructure experts and educators to explore how expert systems can improve access between scientific fields.
</p>
<p>
Such interdisciplinary initiatives and academic community building have long been a focus of Bowker&#8217;s work. As scientific director of the EVOKE Lab at UCI, he brings together a community of scholars, makers and designers that builds new technology and digital experiences with social concerns as the starting point.
