<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This invited workshop aims to bring together
researchers and designers from academia and
industry to discuss directions in the development
of high-performance, parallel, distributed,
and multimedia processors and systems. The
workshop invitees are computer architects
and compiler, operating system, and application
experts. The main goal of the workshop is
to discuss future trends in the development
of architecture and software systems and
to explore the assumptions made by the architects
about software systems and by software writers
about architecture. The increased complexity
in each of these areas calls for increased
interaction with researchers from all of
the other disciplines to accurately assess
the potential directions and future trends
in architecture and systems.<BR>
<BR>
The main themes of the workshop are software-
and technology-driven and constrained new
architectures, compiler/architecture interaction
and co-design, and application requirements
and characteristics. Both numerical and non-numerical
applications, such as database, data mining,
Web- and Java-based, and (high-performance)
embedded applications, are of interest. In
all cases a longer-term view and assessment
of the future is of most interest.<BR>
<BR>
This year's special focus is on multi-core
systems and ways to explore single-program
parallelism on such systems. All aspects
of design, compilation, and application design
are of interest for both single-chip multi-core
processors and multi-processor systems built
from such chips and are the 2009 special
topics.<BR>
<BR>
Other topics of interest include but are
not limited to the following:<BR>
<BR>
* All aspects of processor design<BR>
* Multi-threaded processors<BR>
* Large-scale multiprocessors<BR>
* Memory technology and memory hierarchy
organization<BR>
* Applications and their performance<BR>
* Power management<BR>
* Embedded system design<BR>
<BR>
The workshop will consist of sessions combining
individual presentations with discussion.
Presentations will be limited to ~20 min
to provide sufficient time for discussion.
An ideal presentation will concentrate on
trends and future directions in addition
to recently obtained results. Speculation
is encouraged.<BR>
<BR>
</P>
<H3>Submission and Publication</H3>
<P>The invitees wishing to make a presentation
should submit an extended abstract, up to
3 pages, by 2/28/09. Submissions should be
electronic in pdf format. The abstracts will
be reviewed and printed in the on-site proceedigns.<BR>
<BR>
The final proceedings consisting of full
papers will be published by IEEE Computer
Society Press after the meeting. The papers
will undergo an additional review process
and will be selected for publication in the
post-proceedings. Papers will be due by July
1st 2009.<BR>
Publication instructions will be distributed
by CS Press at a later date. </P>
