<ul>
<li><b>Coursework.</b> Coursework will consist of homeworks,
class presentations, and a course project. The overall grade
will be determined 30% from homeworks, 30% from class
presentation(s), and 40% from the final project.
Group work on homeworks is permitted, but each student must
list his or her collaborators in writing for each problem. If a student
turns in a solution without listing the others who helped produce this
solution, this act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).
(See the
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html">ICS 
Cheating Policy</a>.)
Late homework assignments will not be accepted.<br>
