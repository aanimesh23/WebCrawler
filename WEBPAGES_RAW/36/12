<h3>Getting Started</h3>
Please refer to the <a href="docs/GettingStartedDoc.html">Flamingo Getting Started Guide</a>.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This release (in C++) includes the source code of several
algorithms for approximate string matching developed at UC Irvine. It
includes algorithms for approximate selection queries, location-based approximate keyword search, 
selectivity
estimation for approximate selection queries, approximate queries on
mixed types, and others.  Although an implementation for approximate
joins is included, the focus of this release is on approximate
selection queries.

<p>Here is a brief explanation of the terms used above:

<ul>  
<li><b>Approximate String Search</b>: Given a collection of strings and a single string,
how to find those strings in the collection that are "similar to" the
given string? 
<br>
This functionality is implemented by the modules
<a href="docs/CommonDoc.html">Common</a>, 
<a href="docs/FilterTreeDoc.html">FilterTree</a>,
<a href="docs/ListMergerDoc.html">Listmerger</a>, 
<a href="docs/StringMapDoc.html">StringMap</a>,
and
<a href="docs/PartEnumDoc.html">PartEnum</a>.  
We recommend getting started with
the FilterTree module for this purpose.

<li><b>Selectivity Estimation for Approximate String Search</b>: Given
a collection of strings and a single string, how can we estimate the
number of strings that are "similar to" the given string?  This
functionality is implemented in the SEPIA module.

<li><b>Approximate String Join</b>: Given two collections of strings (possibly the same
collection), how to find those pairs of strings that are "similar to"
each other?

<li><b>Location-Based Approximate Keyword Search</b>: Given a collection of spatial objects with 
descriptive keywords, find those objects within a given spatial region 
that have a given set of keywords. 
In addition, the keywords don't need to match exactly, but approximately.
<br>
This functionality is implemented by the module:
<a href="docs/LbakTreeDoc.html">LBAK-Tree</a>
</ul>  

<p>There are various string similarity functions, such as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein Distance (aka the Edit Distance)</a>,

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_Similarity_Coefficient">Jaccard Similarity</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">Cosine Similarity</a>, and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice%27s_coefficient">Dice
Similarity</a>.  The following is a description of the modules
corresponding to the source directory structure:

<ul>
<li><b><a href="docs/CommonDoc.html">Common</a></b>: This module contains classes for supporting 
the following similarity functions / distance measures: 
Levenshtein Distance (aka Edit Distance), Jaccard Similarity, Cosine Similarity, Dice Similarity. It also
provides functionality for decomposing strings into grams.

<li><b><a href="docs/FilterTreeDoc.html">FilterTree</a></b>: This module provides functionality for approximate string search
using an inverted-list index. Furthermore, 
query performance can be improved by adding filters, i.e. partitioning the string collection into 
disjoint subsets according to some property (e.g. the length of the strings). 
The use of filters is facilitated by a hierarchical structure (the FilterTree), 
in which each level in the tree corresponds to one filter. 
We have implemented the length and charsum filter. This package contains three flavors of indexes: 
in-memory indexes compressed & uncompressed and a disk-based index.

<li><b><a href="docs/ListMergerDoc.html">ListMerger</a></b>: Answering approximate string queries based on an inverted-list index 
requires finding elements that occur at least T times on the inverted lists belonging 
to the grams in the query string (T depends on the similarity metric and the similarity threshold). 
This problem is commonly referred to as the T-occurrence problem.
This module implements several algorithms for solving the T-occurrence problem
as described in "Efficient Merging and Filtering Algorithms for Approximate String Searches",
Chen Li, Jiaheng Lu and Yiming Lu, ICDE 2008.
In addition, we have implemented efficient algorithms for disk-based indexes.

<li><b><a href="docs/MatTreeDoc.html">MAT-Tree</a></b>: MAT-tree is an indexing structure to support
queries on data with an approximate string predicate and a numeric
predicate.  A typical query is: "Find employee records whose name is
similar to Speilberg and whose age is close to 45."  The indexing
structure is proposed in the following paper: "Indexing Mixed Types
for Approximate Retrieval," Liang Jin, Nick Koudas, Chen Li, Anthony
K.H. Tung, VLDB 2005, Trondheim, Norway.

<li><b><a href="docs/SepiaDoc.html">SEPIA</a></b>: This technique solves the problem of estimating the
selectivity of an approximate string predicate.  It can answer
questions such as: "From a collection of strings, how many of them
have an edit distance within 3 to a given string?".  Such information
can be used in optimizing queries of approximate string matching.  The
technique was published in the paper: "Selectivity Estimation for Fuzzy
String Predicates in Large Data Sets," Liang Jin and Chen Li, VLDB
2005, Trondheim, Norway.

<li><b><a href="docs/StringMapDoc.html">StringMap</a></b>: This algorithm maps strings from the
edit-distance metric space to a high-dimensional Euclidean space, and
uses a multi-dimensional indexing structure to answer approximate
queries.  The algorithm is published in the paper: "Efficient Record
Linkage in Large Data Sets," by Liang Jin, Chen Li, and Sharad
Mehrotra, in 8th International Conference on Database Systems for
Advanced Applications (DASFAA) 2003, Kyoto, Japan.

<li><b><a href="docs/PartEnumDoc.html">PartEnum</a></b>: This algorithm is published in the paper:
"Efficient Exact Set-Similarity Joins," Arvind Arasu, Venkatesh Ganti,
Raghav Kaushik, VLDB 2006.  We implemented the algorithm to
support approximate string matching queries, excluding approximate joins.

<li><b><a href="docs/TopkDoc.html">TopK</a></b>: This package contains algorithms for efficient Top-K approximate string search.

<li><b><a href="docs/LbakTreeDoc.html">LBAK-Tree</a></b>: This module implements 
location-based approximate keyword search as described in 
"Supporting Location-Based Approximate Keyword Search", by Sattam Alsubaiee, Alexander Behm and Chen Li.
It enhances an R*-Tree with inverted indexes for approximate selection queries. It implements various 
algorithms for choosing R*-Tree nodes to place inverted indexes in.
The FilterTree module is used to provide the inverted indexes for approximate selection queries.
</ul>

In addition, we have provided some commonly used functions in the
<a href="src/util">util</a> directory.
