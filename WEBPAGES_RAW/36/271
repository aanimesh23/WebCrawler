<h5>ICS 10 • David G. Kay • UC Irvine</h5>
<h1>Fourth Homework</h1>


<p>As usual, you'll do parts of this assignment with a partner, preferably someone you haven't worked with on a prevoius assignment. Please do what it takes to get partnered up early in the week: Having a partner is part of each assignment; not having one will lower your score. Be sure to use the <a href="http://ics-10-partner-app.appspot.com">Partner App</a> so your partnership is recorded.
<!--This week, again we need you to send a message to <a href="mailto:ics10@uci.edu"><code>ics10@uci.edu</code></a> with the names and UCInet IDs of both partners.--></p>
<h4>Part (a) </h4>
<p>Read Chapters 1 and 3 of <em><a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/">Blown to Bits</a>,</em> which talk about the consequences of representing information digitally. We'll be touching on this material over the next week or two, so there's no huge rush.</p>
<h4>Part (b) </h4>
<p>Start with this code that plays a simple game of &quot;tag&quot;: <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/10/hw/TagGame.xml">[Snap version]</a> <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/10/hw/TagGame.ypr">[BYOB version]</a> (right- or control-click on the link to download it). Click the green flag to start. If you move your mouse over the sprites, they say &quot;Ouch,&quot; draw a square, and jump somewhere else (that's it). </p>
<p>With your partner, improve the code in these ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Change the &quot;draw square&quot; block (right-click or control-click on it to edit) to take an additional parameter: the pen color. (In Snap/BYOB, colors range from 0 (reddish) to 100 (blueish); colors 101 through 200 cycle back from blue towards red.) Then create a new sprite that behaves like the other(s), except that it draws squares in a different color.</li>
  <li>To make the game a little harder, have each sprite change its size (perhaps by –10) every time it's tagged.</li>
  <li>Change the &quot;React if touched&quot; block so that it takes parameters for what to say when tagged, the pen color, and the amount to change size. Then for each of your sprites, call the &quot;React if touched&quot; block with different parameter values so that each sprite behaves differently when tagged (even though each sprite calls the same &quot;React if touched&quot; block).</li>
</ul>
<p>When you're done, export your Snap project into a file whose name is in the usual form (e.g., <code>hw4b-joeq-jane25</code>). Submit this document via <a href="http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/">Checkmate</a>. Just one partner should submit one copy; the file name and your Email message will let us give both partners credit.</p>
<h4>Part (c) </h4>
<p>This part is optional, in that you're not required to turn anything in. But if you didn't get a perfect score on <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/10/hw/DeusXercises.pdf">last week's (Deus X) assignment</a>, we'd recommend that you get a little more practice since similar problems will turn up on the midterm and final. First of all, go back and make sure you know how to get the correct answers on the assignment itself (not just what the correct answers are—we sent those out—but how to get them). If you tried to &quot;eyeball&quot; the problems rather than painstakingly step through each instruction, or worse yet, if you just relied on your partner to figure it out, you're missing the point: The first key concept to understand is the rudimentary, step-by-step nature of machine language program behavior. So step your way through each of the two programs on the assignment, using the input data we provided. If you don't remember what an instruction does, drop us a message (at <a href="mailto:ics10@uci.edu"><code>ics10@uci.edu</code></a>) and we'll help you out. It's also a good idea to re-read the instructions and advice we provided on the assignment page. We've also put a copy of the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/10/DeusXInstructionSet.pdf">Deus X Instruction Set</a> on line, in case you lost yours.</p>
<p>If you're still not seeing the big picture, don't worry. Try the programs again, but this time with different input. Try Part I with these input lines
<pre>  7
  9
  1
  2
  0
  1
  <em>(blank line)</em> 
</pre>  
and again with these
<pre>
    7

    1
    <em>(blank line)</em>
</pre>
Try Part II with these input lines 
<pre>
  4
  Mycroft</pre>
and again with these:
<pre>
  1
  Watson</pre>
</p>For most people, working through these problems is not quite as much fun as a trip to Disneyland.  But the concepts will show up again and again in this course, so it's worth learning them because they'll help  you understand other concepts (that you may enjoy more).

<p>Nadine will hold some lab hours during the week: Wednesday, 11:00 to noon and 2:30 to 3:30; Thursday, 11:00 to noon and 3:00 to 4:00.<!--in the third-floor ICS lab, room 364 ICS: Tuesday 25 January, 11:00–noon and 1:00–2:00; Wednesday 26 January, 2:30–3:30. She will also be glad to make appointments for other times; just send mail to  <code>ics10@uci.edu</code>.  For the best chance at finding a workable time, give a few alternatives and don't wait until the end of the week.
