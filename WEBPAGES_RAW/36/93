Approximating the Shortest Path in a Line Arrangement
<br>
Speaker: David Hart, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

<p>
No one knows how to compute the shortest path between two points in
a line arrangement in less than \theta(n^2).  We first show that one
can simplify this to finding a shortest path in a grid of quadrilaterals
(which has the complication of having paths traveling on a boundary
around the grid).  
</p>
<p>
The only previously published approximation algorithm gives a factor
of 2 approximation to the shortest path in O(n log n).  We use the
simpler grid structure to give a much better approximation algorithm.
</p>
<p>
This is a preliminary version of what will be a job talk.  The
associated paper is to be submitted for publication.
