Welcome to the lab for Machine Learning and Bioinformatics at [[http://www.ics.uci.edu|School of Information and Computer Sciences]] of [[http://www.uci.edu| University of California, Irvine]]!   \\
\\
Our lab studies a broad range of problems in machine learning and computational biology/bioinformatics. We are interested in both developing machine learning methods and applying these methods to study problems from biology, computer vision and NLP.
