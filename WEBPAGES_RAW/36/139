    <LI>Options: Concentrate on <em>Show Toolbar, Show Location, 
      Show Directory Buttons, Auto Load Images</em>;
    <LI>Window: You need to use the <em>Bookmarks</em> window to
       manipulate your own collection of bookmarks:
       <UL>
        <LI> Organize your bookmarks in folders which you create.
        <LI> Move bookmarks between folders, 
        <LI> Give bookmarks and bookmark folders reasonable,
             descriptive names.

             disk and use Netscape to view the contents of that file.
        <LI> Import bookmarks and delete unwanted ones.
        </UL>
    <LI>Help: <em>Handbook</em> is worth exploring a bit.
    </UL><P>
    The most important things here are
    <ol>
    <li> to become familiar with the various options, 
    <li> to start building your own personal bookmark list, and 
    <li> to be able to use the <em>Open Location</em> fluently.
    </ol>
    <B>NOTE:</B> You must position the mouse inside
    type-in windows such as
    <em>Open Location</em> and <em>Find</em>.  You can click the mouse
    or use the arrows to reposition the cursor within the window, 
    but <b>(beware)</b> the Macintosh <em>delete</em>
    key deletes to the <b>left</b> of where the cursor is within
    the window.  So to edit strings in type-in windows, one typically
    <b>must</b> use a button click or arrow keys to position the cursor
    to the <b>left</b> of where the insertion is to be made or to the 
    <b>right</b> of a desired deletion.)

    use Netscape to view that file.
