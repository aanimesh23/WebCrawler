<H2> Abstract </H2>

The User Interface Design Assistant (UIDA)
addresses the specific design problems of style and integration 
consistency throughout the user interface development process 
and aids in the automated feedback and evaluation of a system's 
graphical user interface according to knowledge-based rules and 
project specific design examples.  The UIDA system is able to 
quickly identify inconsistent style guide interpretations and 
UI design decisions resulting from distributed development of 
multiple UI sub-systems. This case arises when each sub-system
conforms to the general style guide rules, but when
integrated together, may appear inconsistent.
