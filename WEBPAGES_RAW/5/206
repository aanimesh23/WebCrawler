<h3 class="trigger">How do I get into the Bren School of ICS Honors Program?</h3>
<div>
<p>The Bren School Honors Program provides an opportunity for selected students in any one of the Bren School majors to pursue advanced work in one of the research areas in the School. </p>
<p>Admission to the program is based on a formal application submitted to the School in the spring. Applications are available each year beginning May 1 and should be submitted by June 1 to ensure consideration. Students are notified during August and September since spring and summer (if applicable) grades are considered.</p>
<p>Major-specific courses and GPA requirements are <a href="../honors/index.php">listed at the Bren School Honors Opportunities Program page</a>.</p>
<p>In selecting students for the honors program, the School also considers evidence of ability and interest in research. </p>
<p>Students admitted to the program participate in the Bren School Honors Seminar (ICS H197), which provides an introduction to research areas in the School, followed by a minimum of two quarters of independent supervised research (CS H198 or Informatics H198).</p>
<p>Passing two H198s counts for one of the project courses required for the ICS and CS majors, provided that at least one of the remaining two project courses is taken in a different area. </p>
<p>In order for the student to be considered to have successfully completed the honors program, the work must be written up as a final report and certified to be of honors quality by the student&#8217;s faculty advisor and the Honors Program advisor.</p>

<h3 class="trigger">What does it mean to be on academic probation?</h3>
<div>
<p>You are subject to probation any time your quarterly or cumulative GPA falls below 2.0. </p>
<p>The Student Affairs Office will notify you of your probation status by email to your UCI account and U.S. mail to your permanent address, and will specify conditions that must be met to return to good academic standing (quarterly and cumulative GPAs above 2.0). &#160;<br/><br/>The conditions constitute a &#8220;contract&#8221; that outlines specific academic progress expectations and a timeframe by which you must return to good academic standing.&#160;&#160; </p>
<p>Contact your Bren School academic counselor soon after your probation notification to ensure that your academic plan is reasonable and to learn about campus resources and success strategies that may be helpful. </p>
<p>It is your responsibility to manage your UCI account and to read and respond to official messages from your academic counselors in a timely manner. Failure to follow through on the steps outlined in your probation letter may result in an administrative hold being placed on your record.</p>

<h3 class="trigger">What does it mean to be "subject to disqualification"?</h3>
<div>
<p>A student who fails to meet the conditions of an academic contract after two consecutive quarters, OR whose GPA falls below 1.5 for any quarter, will be notified that he/she is &#8220;subject to disqualification&#8221; (note:&#160; this is a preliminary step in the review and decision-making process &#8211; it is NOT the same as being &#8220;formally disqualified&#8221;).&#160; <br/><br/>Official notification will be sent from the Bren School&#8217;s Associate Dean for Student Affairs to the student&#8217;s UCI email address and by certified letter to the student&#8217;s permanent address. </p>
<p>The notification letter provides instructions for <strong>appealing</strong> the disqualification action. <br/><br/><i><strong>All students are strongly encouraged to appeal the disqualification</strong></i> by submitting a letter to the Associate Dean,<a href="mailto:adsa@ics.uci.edu">adsa@ics.uci.edu</a>.&#160; <br/><br/>This appeal letter should explain any unusual or extenuating circumstances that contributed to the student&#8217;s academic difficulties and detail the student&#8217;s plans and actions for effectively addressing these circumstances (including the use of campus resources).&#160; <br/><br/>The Associate Dean will carefully review the student&#8217;s appeal letter, transcript and academic file with the counselors before making a decision.&#160; <br/><br/>If the appeal is granted, the student will be held to an academic contract that outlines the expectations and timeframe for returning to good academic standing.&#160; <br/><br/>If the appeal is not granted, the student will be formally disqualified (this means dismissed from the major, the Bren School of ICS, and UC Irvine) and restricted from registering for courses or using university services after a stated date.&#160; The Registrar&#8217;s Office will also be instructed to note the effective date of the disqualification on the student&#8217;s official transcript.&#160; </p>
<p>The Associate Dean for Student Affairs is the chief academic officer for the Bren School of ICS; therefore, his decisions regarding disqualification appeals are FINAL. </p>

<h3 class="trigger">What is the readmission policy?</h3>
<div>
<p>Readmission to UCI and the Bren School of ICS is NOT automatic.&#160; </p>
<p>Please <a href="http://www.reg.uci.edu/registrar/soc/read.html">visit this link for more information about fees, procedures and deadlines</a>.</p>
<p>The Readmission Application Form is available at Registrar's Office or the Bren School Student Affairs Office.&#160; </p>
<p><strong>Bren School Student Affairs Office requires additional documentation for consideration of readmission. </strong></p>
<p>All materials required for readmission petition must be submitted to the Bren School Student Affairs Office as a complete package. An academic counselor will attach a summary of previous course work and/or contract conditions for the Associate Dean&#8217;s consideration. </p>
<p>Only UC-transferable courses (<a href="http://www.assist.org">www.assist.org</a>) will be considered when determining a student&#8217;s eligibility for readmission to one of the Bren School majors.</p>
<p>The Associate Dean for Student Affairs will consider the applicant&#8217;s number of completed units while at UCI, number of units remaining for completion of general education and degree requirements, grades for coursework taken at other institutions or through ACCESS UCI, and demonstrated readiness for the academic challenge of UCI coursework. </p>
<p>A readmitted student who has not been enrolled at UCI for three or more consecutive quarters must adhere to the graduation requirements: <strong>(a)</strong> in effect for the quarter in which the student is readmitted; or <strong>(b)</strong> those subsequently established.</p>
<p><strong>Readmission to the Bren School after voluntary withdrawal from UCI <i>while in good standing</i>:<br/><br/></strong>Readmission will be automatic if the student re-enrolls within one year and will otherwise be considered on a case by case basis. </p>
<p>A readmission petition can be submitted at the same time as a withdrawal form is filed. </p>
<p>If known, students should indicate their intended quarter of re-entry at the time of withdrawal.</p>
<p><strong>Readmission to the Bren School after voluntary withdrawal from UCI <i>while student is on Academic Probation</i>:</strong><br/><br/>In certain situations, the Bren School may approve a student&#8217;s time-limited withdrawal if it becomes evident that doing so will prevent further damage to the student&#8217;s academic record. </p>
<p>Conditions for readmission in this case would be discussed at the time of withdrawal; any academic contract conditions in place at the time of withdrawal would remain in effect upon the student&#8217;s return.</p>
<p><strong>The UCI readmission application must be accompanied by:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> A written statement no longer than 2 pages that details the reason(s) for leaving, the reason(s) for returning (including new or renewed interest/focus on Bren School major), and ways that previous or existing obstacles to academic progress have been addressed and will be addressed in the future.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> An official transcript showing completion of at least 1 full-time quarter or semester of transferable courses in Computer Science or mathematics with a GPA satisfying the conditions specified in the student&#8217;s academic contract.</p>
<p><strong>Readmission to the Bren School <i>after academic disqualification</i>:</strong><br/><br/>The Associate Dean will consider the number of units remaining towards breadth and major degree requirements. </p>
<p>In general, a student applying for readmission will need to demonstrate that he/she can finish remaining coursework within a timeframe that does not violate university policies regarding excessive units (see Catalogue, &#8220;UCI Policy on Excessive Units&#8221; for more information). </p>
<p>A student readmitted after academic disqualification will be held to the conditions of a two quarter contract specifying a course plan, unit maximum per quarter, GPA expectations, and mandatory advising sessions. </p>
<p>Failure to meet the contract conditions for any of two quarters may lead to automatic disqualification.</p>
<p><strong>The UCI readmission application must be accompanied by:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> A written statement no longer than 2 pages that details the reason(s) for leaving, the reason(s) for returning (including new or renewed interest/focus on Bren School major), and ways that previous or existing obstacles to academic progress have been addressed and will be addressed in the future.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> An official transcript showing completion of a minimum of one full-time academic year of courses taken through UCI Extension (ACCESS), a community college or another comparable institution. </p>
<p>At least six of these courses must meet major requirements (includes math courses). </p>
<p>The overall GPA for this year of work must be at least a 2.5. In some cases the requirement that a full year of coursework be completed elsewhere can be waived, if there is considerable evidence that the student is fully prepared to return to UCI full time.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> If the student intends to petition for a Change of Major into or out of the Bren School upon readmission, he/she must submit a completed Change of Major form.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Students considering applying for readmission after academic disqualification are strongly encouraged to meet with an academic counselor well in advance of preparing their application.</p>
