      <h1>A Brief Introduction to WEBDAV</h1>
      
<P>Today the typical use of the World Wide Web is to browse information
in a largely read-only manner. However, this was not the original
conception of the Web; as early as 1990, a prototype Web editor and
browser was operational on the Next platform, demonstrating how Web
content could be read and written. Unfortunately, most of the world
never saw this editor/browser, instead developing their view of the
Web from the widely distributed text-based line mode browser. When
NCSA Mosaic was developed, it improved the line mode browser by adding
a graphical user interface and inline images, but had no provision for
editing. As Mosaic 2.4 reached critical mass in 1993-4,
"publish/browse" became the dominant model for the Web.

<P>However, the original view of the Web as a readable and writable
collaborative medium was not lost. In 1995 two browser/editor products
were released: NaviPress by NaviSoft and FrontPage by Vermeer. These
products began developing a market for authoring tools which allow a
user to edit HyperText Markup Language (HTML) pages remotely,
taking advantage of the ability to work at a distance over the
Internet. In early 1996, NaviSoft and Vermeer were purchased by
America Online and Microsoft respectively, presaging major corporate
interest in Web distributed authoring technology. In 1995-96, Netscape
released Navigator Gold, a Web browser/editor tool, with the ability
to publish pages to a remote Web server. 1996-7 also saw the release
of Web-integrated word processors, with Microsoft Word 97, Lotus
WordPro 97, and Corel WordPerfect 7 all having HTML editing and remote
publishing capability.

<P>In this setting, an ad-hoc collection of people interested in
remote authoring (now known as the WEBDAV working group) met first at
the WWW4 conference in December, 1995, and then next at America Online
in June, 1996. Comprised of developers working on remote authoring
tools, and people generally interested in extending the Web for
authoring, this group identified key issues encountered in writing
these authoring tools. The group also found that there was a pressing
need to develop standard extensions to the HyperText Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) for the following capabilities:

<ul>
<li><i>Metadata.</i> The ability to create, remove, and query
information about Web pages, such as its author, creation date,
etc. Also, the ability to link pages of any media type to related
pages.

<li><i>Name space management.</i> The ability to copy and move Web
pages, and to receive a listing of pages at a particular hierarchy
level (like a directory listing in a file system).

<li><i>Overwrite prevention.</i> The ability to keep more than one
person from working on a document at the same time. This prevents the
"lost update problem" in which modifications are lost as first one
author, then another writes their changes without merging the other
author's changes.

<li><i>Version management.</i> The ability to store important
revisions of a document for later retrieval. Version management can
also support collaboration by allowing two or more authors to work on
the same document in parallel tracks.
</ul>

<P>From its inception, the WEBDAV group has been working steadily to
produce an interoperability specification which defines HTTP methods
and their semantics for the above capabilities. Work in this direction
has focused on three documents, a <i>scenarios document</i>, which
gives a series of short descriptions of how distributed authoring and
versioning functionality can be used, typically from an end-user
perspective, a <i>requirements document</i>, which describes the
high-level functional requirements for distributed authoring and
versioning, including rationale, and a <i>protocol specification</i>,
which describes new HTTP methods, headers, request bodies, and
response bodies, to implement the distributed authoring and versioning
requirements.  On March 20, 1997, the Internet Engineering Steering
Group (IESG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) approved
the charter of the WEBDAV Working Group, making WEBDAV an official
working group in the Applications Area.  WEBDAV is working
cooperatively with the World Wide Web Consortium, which provides
technical assistance and help contacting interested people within the
Web community.
