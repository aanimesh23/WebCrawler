<h1>CS 263, Spring 2014, Homework 2</h1>
<h2>Due at the start of class, Thursday, April 17</h2>

<ol>
<li>[Mitzenmacher and Upfal 3.8]<p>Suppose that algorithm A chooses a single random number in the range from 1 to <i>n</i> and then performs a computation that, if all choices are equally likely, takes expected time <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>). What can you say about the worst-case time for algorithm A?</p>
<p><i>Hint: use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov's_inequality">Markov's inequality</a>.</i></p></li>

<li>[Mitzenmacher and Upfal 3.21]<p>Let <i>p</i> be a random permutation of <i>n</i> items, with all permutations equally likely. What is the probability that item <i>i</i> is mapped to itself by permutation <i>p</i>?
Use your answer and linearity of expectation to compute <i>E</i>[<i>X</i>] where <i>X</i> is the number of items that are mapped to themselves.</li>

<li><p>Define a graph to be "tight" if every two vertices are either
adjacent or connected by a path of length two (or both). We wish to find
the threshold probability that determines whether a random graph is
tight.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>In the <i>G</i>(<i>n</i>,<i>p</i>) model of random graphs,
what is the probability that a given pair of vertices are not
tight?</p></li>
<li><p>Approximately how large does <i>p</i> need to be to ensure that
with constant probability the whole graph is tight? (Apply Markov's
inequality to the expected number of non-tight pairs.)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the expected number of edges in a random graph with this probability?</p></ol></li>

<li><p>We saw in class that if <i>n</i> balls each choose the less full
of two random bins, from a set of <i>B</i> bins, then:</p>
<ul><li>If <i>n</i> is much smaller than &radic;<i>B</i> then with high
probability each bin will have at most one ball (the birthday paradox),
and</li>
<li>if <i>n</i> and <i>B</i> are approximately equal, then with high probability the most full bin will have <i>O</i>(log&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>) balls (the power of two choices).</li></ul><p>The aim of this problem is to interpolate between those two results.</p>
<p>Recall the following facts:</p>
<ul><li>For <i>n</i> smaller than a constant times <i>B</i>,
each connected component of the random graph <i>G</i> whose vertices are
bins and whose edges are the pairs of cells for each ball is (with high
probability) either a tree or a tree-plus-one-edge.</li>
<li>When the <i>i</i>th ball lands in a bin, and that bin belongs to a
component that is either a tree or a tree-plus-one-edge, we can find a
complete binary tree of height&nbsp;<i>i</i> on the balls in that
component, showing that <i>i</i> is at most logarithmic in the size of
the component.</ul>
<p>Now suppose that <i>n</i> is significantly smaller
than <i>B</i>. Calculate (in terms of <i>n</i> and <i>B</i>) the
expected number of components of <i>G</i> that have at least one edge,
the expected number of components that have at least two edges, etc. Use
Markov's inequality to find the maximum value <i>c</i> such that there
is constant probability of having a component of size at
least <i>c</i>. What does this bound on component size, together with
the complete binary tree argument, imply about the maximum number of
balls per bin?</p></li>
