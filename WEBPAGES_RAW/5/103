<p>

Department of Defense policy states that DoD design and development 
of systems must be based on systems engineering principles. 
For software-intensive systems, these principles include selecting 
contractors with domain experience in developing comparable 
software systems, a successful past performance record, and a 
demonstrable, mature software development process. At the Space and 
Missile Systems Center (SMC), the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), 
and Air Force Material Command (AFMC), two methods for evaluating 
contractor capability are in use. The first method is based on the 
Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model (CMM) 
for software and uses the Software Capability Evaluation (SCE) process. 
The second method is the Software Development Capability Evaluation (SDCE), 
which includes its own model and process. Conducting either of these 
evaluations during the source selection process increases the likelihood 
of selecting a contractor capable of developing the required software 
within program constraints. Additionally, the SCE and SDCE help identify 
and manage risks early in a program's lifecycle and provide a means to 
obtain contractual commitment to the use of sound software engineering 
practices throughout the lifecycle.

<p>

The purpose of our presentation is to introduce the SDCE and compare it 
with the SCE. We will begin with an historical background of the SDCE and 
a brief description of its model and process, including revisions to the 
model that were developed at The Aerospace Corporation. We will then compare 
the SDCE and SCE in terms of their purposes, models, and processes, review 
applications of the SDCE and SCE to various DoD programs, and discuss the 
benefits of their use. Finally, we will examine lessons learned from past 
evaluation experiences.
