<h1>CS 263, Spring 2014: Analysis of Algorithms</h1>

<p>This course meets Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays, 3:00 - 3:50 in Bren 1429.
Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks, graded during the
class period on which they are due, and a final exam. Group work on
homeworks is permitted and encouraged. Knowledge of a previous course in
the design and analysis of algorithms (such as the CS 161 or CS 260
courses taught at UCI) is expected, but otherwise all CS graduate
students are welcome.</p>

<p>The textbook for this course will
be <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Vijay.Vazirani/book.pdf"><i>Approximation
Algorithms</i></a>, by Vijay Vazirani.
The tentative schedule of topics is to go through the chapters of this book at a rate of approximately one chapter per lecture.</p>

<p>Tentative schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Week 1: Chapters 1-2 (combinatorial algorithms). Homework, due in class Friday, Jan 16: Exercises 1.1, 1.3, 2.8, 2.14.</li>
<li>Week 2: Chapters 3-5 (combinatorial algorithms). Homework, due in class Friday, Jan 23: Exercises 3.2, 3.5, 4.7, 5.1</li>
<li>Week 3: Holiday Monday. Chapters 6-7 (combinatorial algorithms).</li>
<li>Week 4: Chapters 8-10 (approximation schemes). Homework, due in
  class Friday, Jan 30: (1) Exercise 3
  of <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/304362.html">this blog post</a>.
  (2) Find a counterexample to the "clearly" equality on page 56,
  mentioned in the footnote of the blog post. (3,4) Exercises 6.1, 7.1.

  randomized comparison-based sorting algorithm must use
  &Omega;(n&nbsp;log&nbsp;n) comparisons to sort n items. (Hint: in a
  binary tree with k leaves, the average distance to a leaf is at least
  log<sub>2</sub>k.)</li>
