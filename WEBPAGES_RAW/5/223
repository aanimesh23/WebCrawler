<p class="p3"><b>Description</b><br>
Now that we have talked through some examples in Lecture 3, improve your design based upon what we have discussed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Prepare a presentation slide that contains your revised UML design (if it is not easily visible on one slide, you may put parts of it on multiple slides, but no more than 3 slides, please).</li>
  <li class="li4">Be prepared to talk for at most 3-4 minutes about your design in front of the class.</li>
  <li class="li4">Presentations will take place in class on January 15th and January 20th. Students will be called up to present in a randomized order.</li>
  <li class="li4">On January 22nd, bring SIX copies of your revised design: one with your name and ID on it, and five anonymized copies with a number on each that I will email to you.</li>
  <li class="li4">You may revise your design between the time you present it and the time you turn in the final version on January 22nd.</li>
</ul>
