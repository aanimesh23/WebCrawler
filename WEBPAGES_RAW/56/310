      <p>Welcome!  Please note a couple of things as we get started this quarter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first lectures will meet on Tuesday, January 10.  Lab sections begin meeting on Friday, January 13.  For more information about meeting times of lab sections, see the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>.  For information about lecture material and readings, see the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>.</li>
        <li>I encourage you to spend some time reading through the material on the course web site.  It will be updated periodically throughout the quarter, and there will always be an announcement here describing each update.  For now, notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>, the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>, and the <a href="ProjectGuide">Project Guide</a>, as well as a set of <a href="Notes">Notes and Examples</a> &mdash; mostly emanating from the lectures &mdash; that will be posted throughout the quarter.</li>
        <li>For those of you planning on using your own machines for at least some of your work, it might be worth spending some time working through <a href="ProjectGuide/Assignment0">Assignment #0</a>, which provides instructions on getting the necessary software installed and configured.  (Read the <a href="ProjectGuide">Project Guide</a> page first, for some context on the necessary software and some background on what we're going to be doing.)</li>
