<h2>ICS 269, Fall 2005: Theory Seminar</h2>

<h1>Minimum Dilation Stars in Metric Spaces</h1>

<h2>Kevin Wortman</h2>

<h3>October 21, 2005, in CS 259</h3>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>We consider the following problem: given a collection of <i>n</i> sites
separated by distances obeying the triangle inequality, create a star
(tree of depth 1) whose root is a new center site and whose leaves
are the input sites, such that the dilation of the star is minimal.
The problem amounts to computing a weight for each of the <i>n</i> edges
from the root to the leaves, such that all the weights in the star obey
the triangle inequality.  This talk will describe an
O(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>)-time algorithm
for computing the optimal dilation value, which is a significant
component of an algorithm that computes the edge weights.</p>
