	    Red-black tree
	    BB[alpha] tree
	    Splay tree
	Skip list
	Flat tree and fusion tree (integers)

    Range queries on point data
	Augmented binary search trees

	(very briefly) kD-trees and quadtrees
	Recursive data structures with BB[alpha]-trees
	Range minimization structure

    Range queries on interval data
	Interval trees
	Segment trees
	Recursive structures with segment trees

    String searching

    Structure in trees
	Navigation in trees (parent pointers, child pointers, both)
	Cutting and linking trees
	Least common ancestors

    Disjoint sets and incremental connectivity

General techniques
    Find a way to transform the problem into a tree
	(e.g. Cartesian tree for range min)
    Fractional cascading (speed up repeated binary searches)
    Persistence
    Micro-macro structure
	(precompute solutions for small data subsets, organize overall data
	with less space-efficient structure with one data item per subset
	as in range minimization data structure)
