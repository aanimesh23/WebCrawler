<H1>ICS 180, Winter 1999:<BR>
Strategy and board game programming</H1>

<H2>Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11:00, CS 243</H2>

<P>IBM's chess program "Deep Blue" gained national headlines
when it beat the world champion, Gary Kasparov, in a
six-game match.  How did it do it?  How can you program a computer to
play chess, go, or other board games, if not well enough to beat
Kasparov, at least well enough to beat other strong humans?

<P>This class attempts to answer these questions, by describing the
techniques and programming tricks used to build efficient game-playing
programs.
There will be no homeworks or exams.  However, students
will be expected to do a <A HREF="project.html">programming project</A>.
