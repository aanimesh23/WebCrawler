<h1>On maximizing welfare when utility functions are subadditive</h1>

<h2>Authored by Uriel Feige, appeared in STOC 2006</h2>

<h2>Presented by Matthew Ba Nguyen</h2>

<p>
Abstract:
<p>
The author considers the problem of maximizing welfare when allocating
<I>m</I> items to <I>n</I> players.  In this problem, a feasible
allocation allocates every item to at most one player.
For every player <I>P<sub>i</sub></I>, her utility <I>w<sub>i</sub></I>
depends only on the set of items she receives.  The goal is to find a
feasible allocation that maximizes social welfare, that is,
maximizing &sum;<I>w<sub>i</sub></I>(S).
<p>
The author presents a rounding technique that converts a fractional LP
solution to a feasible allocation resulting in a 1/2 approximation.
More importantly the author shows this is true even when utility
functions are subadditive.
