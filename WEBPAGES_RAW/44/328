Situational awareness (SA) applications monitor the real world and
the entities therein to support tasks such as rapid
decision-making, reasoning, and analysis. Raw input about
unfolding events may arrive from variety of sources in the form of
sensor data, video streams, human observations, and so on, from
which events of interest are extracted. Location is one of the
most important attributes of events, useful for a variety of SA
tasks. In this article, we consider the problem of reaching
situation awareness from textual input. We propose an approach to
probabilistically model and represent (potentially uncertain)
event locations described by human reporters in the form of free
text. We analyze several types of spatial queries of interest in
SA applications. We design techniques to store and index the uncertain locations, to support the efficient processing of queries. Our extensive experimental evaluation over real and synthetic datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
