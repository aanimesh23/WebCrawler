<h1>The Rainbow Skip Graph:  A Fault-Tolerant Constant-Degree
Distributed Data Structure</h1>

<h2>Michael Nelson</h2>

<h3>October 14, 2005, in CS 259</h3>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>We present a distributed data structure, which we call the
rainbow skip graph. To our knowledge, this is the first peer-
to-peer data structure that simultaneously achieves high
fault-tolerance, constant-sized nodes, and fast update and
query times for ordered data. It is a non-trivial adaptation
of the SkipNet/skip-graph structures of Harvey et al. and
Aspnes and Shah, so as to provide fault-tolerance as these
structures do, but to do so using constant-sized nodes, as
in the family tree structure of Zatloukal and Harvey. It
supports successor queries on a set of n items using O(log n)
messages with high probability, an improvement over the
expected O(log n) messages of the family tree.</p>
