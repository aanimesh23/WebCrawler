Weaving Patterns of Lines and Line Segments in Space<br>
<a href="/~javid/">Javid H&uuml;seynov</a>, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

<p>A weaving W is a simple arrangement of lines (or line segments)
in the plane together with a binary relation specifying which line
is "above" the other. Two weavings are equivalent if the underlying
arrangements of lines are combinatorially equivalent and the
"above-below" relations are the same. An equivalence class of
weavings is called a weaving pattern.</p>

<p>In a perfect weaving pattern, along each line l of W, the lines
intersecting it are alternately "above" and "below". This paper
discusses the realization of weavings and weaving patterns in
3-space. The authors prove that:</p>

<ol>
<li>A perfect weaving pattern of n lines is realizable iff
n&lt;=3</li>

<li>A perfect m by n (bipartite) weaving pattern of line segments
is realizable iff min(m,n) &lt;= 3</li>

<li>If n -&gt; infinity, then almost all weaving patterns are
nonrealizable.</li>
</ol>

Welzl, in <i>Algorithmica</i> 9:561-571, 1993.)</p>
