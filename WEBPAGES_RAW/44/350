  In this lecture, we will discuss a powerful aggregate data structure: arrays.
  Arrays allow us to store collections of arbitrary-sized sequences of values
    (both primitive types and references to objects), and easily access and
    manipulate all these values.
  We will learn how to declare arrays, picture them, and perform operations
    on arrays (mostly by looping, and performing operations on the individual
    values in the arrays).
  We will examine how arrays can be used as instance variables in classes.
  <p>
  Once we have learned the basic array material, we will discuss wrapper
    classes and the <b>Object</b> class.
  Putting all this information together, we will learn how to represent two
    simple, general, and powerful collection classes (stack and queue) with
    expandable arrays stored as instance variables.
  We will follow-up on this material later in the semester, with a systematic
    study of even more powerful Java collection classes.
  <p>
  Arrays are very similar to objects from a special class, and we will
    exploit this similarity throughout our discussion of arrays.
  There is also a strong connection between arrays (which are indexed by a
    sequence of integers) and <b>for</b> loops (which easily generate a
    sequence of such integers).
  Finally, there is also a connection between files and arrays: often the
    information stored in a file (easily processed sequentially) is read and
    stored into an array (where it can be easily and efficiently processed -and
    reprocessed- either sequentially or randomly).

  We declare and initialize array variables like other class variables, but by
    specifying the type and constructor in a special form: for 1-dimensional
    (1-d) arrays, the type is specified as any Java type (primitive or
    reference) followed by <b>[]</b>; the constructor uses that same type,
    with an <b>int</b> value (computed by a literal or more general expression)
    inside the brackets.
  The value computed from this expression specifies the length of the array:
    how many values it contains.
  Once we construct an array object, its length may not change: there is
    no mutator for that operation.
  So, for example, we can declare and initialize an array variable storing a
    reference to an object containing 5 <b>int</b>s by the declaration
  <pre><b>  int[] a = new int[5];</b></pre>
  This variable, and the object it refers to, are illustrated in the following
    picture.

  Pronounce <b>[]</b> as "array"; so <b>int[]</b> is pronounces as "int array".
  Array objects are labelled by their array type; they contain two major parts:
    a sequence of indexed boxes and a special box named <b>length</b>.
  Notice four important facts about arrays illustrated by this picture.
  <ul>
    <li>
      An array is a <b>homogeneous</b> data structure: each of its indexed
        members is labelled by (and stores) the same type (here <b>int</b>).
      Constrast this with the other classes that we have discussed, which are
        <b>heterogeneous</b>: each of their instance variables can store a
        different type.
      We can declare arrays to store sequences of either primitive or reference
        types.
      Because this is an <b>int[]</b>, each box in the sequence stores an
        <b>int</b> value, and is so labelled.
      Each box in the sequence is also labelled by its index (<b>0</b>,
        <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, etc.) which is always an <b>int</b> no matter what
        type is stored inside each box.
    <p>
    <li>
      The indexes are numbered from <b>0</b> to one less than the length of the
        array (here the maximum index is <b>4</b>, which is one less than the
        length of the array, which is <b>5</b>).
      This decision, while elegant from a mathematical perspective, is a
        disaster from a psychological perspective: most humans start counting
        at <b>1</b>, not <b>0</b>, and most of us expect the length of the
        array to be the same as the index of the last box in the array.
      But C, C++, and Java all start the indexes of their arrays at <b>0</b>,
        so, we must overcome human nature when we use arrays in programming.
    <p>
    <li>
      Each array object defines a <b>public final int length</b> instance
        variable that stores the length of the array.
      Its value is specified when the array object is constructed, and is
        unchangeable after that: because <b>length</b> has the <b>final</b>
        access modifier, we CANNOT attempt to change its value.
      But, we can directly access (i.e., not through an accessor) the value
        stored in this field.
      In this example, we could write <b>a.length</b> in our code: it is an
        expression that evaluates to <b>5</b>.
      In fact, we can always specify the highest legal index in the array
        object by the expression <b>a.length-1</b>.
      So given a reference to an array, we can always determine its length,
        and from it the highest index.
    <p>
    <li>
       Like all instance variables, ALL INDEXED MEMBERS ARE AUTOMATICALLY
         INITIALIZED when the array object is constructed.
       Java initializes them as it initializes all instance variables: for the
         primitive types, it uses <b>0</b> for <b>int</b>, <b>0.</b> for
         <b>double</b>, <b>false</b> for <b>boolean</b>, and the null character
         for <b>char</b>; for all reference types it uses <b>null</b>
         (meaning that they do not refer to any object).
       Here all the indexed members are initialized to <b>0</b>.
  </ul>
  <p>
  We must use only non-negative lengths when we construct arrays objects
    (a length of <b>0</b> is allowed, and does have some interesting uses).
  If we specify a negative value, the special constructor for arrays throws the
     <b>NegativeArraysSizeException</b>.
  <p>
  We can also construct an array by declaring all the values that it must
    contain; in such a case, the length of the array is automatically inferred
    from the number of values.
  So, for example, we can declare and initialize an array variable storing a
    reference to an object containing the five <b>int</b> values 4, 2, 0, 1,
    and 3 (in that order) by the declaration
  <pre><b>  int[] a = new int[]{4, 2, 0, 1, 3};</b></pre>
  If you think about <b>int[]</b> as the class name and <b>{4,2,0,1,3}</b> as
    the parameters to the constructor for an object from that class, this
    syntax is reasonable.
  Of course, we cannot take this similarity too far, because constructors
    always have a set number of parameters, while any number of arguments
    are allowed between these braces.
  The types of all the values in the braces must be compatible with the
    type of the array used in the constructor.
  <p>
  We illustrate the result of executing this declaration by the following
    picture.

<!-- Accessing Arrays-->

<a name="AccessingArrays"><hr align="left" width="33%">

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Accessing Arrays by their Indexed Members</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  We can access any individual member stored in an array object by using
  <ul>
    <li>the variable that refers to the array object,
    <li>and the index of the member that we want to access
         (written as an expression inside brackets).
  </ul>
  So, if we declare <b>int[] a = new int[]{4, 2, 0, 1, 3};</b> then we  can
    write <b>System.out.println( a[0] );</b> Java would print the value stored
    in index <b>0</b> in array <b>a</b>, which is <b>4</b>.
  We pronounce <b>a[0]</b> as "a at index 0" or just "a sub 0" (similar to the
    subscript in mathematical notation: think of the sequence 
    <b>a<sub>0</sub></b>, <b>a<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>a<sub>2</sub></b>, etc.)
  Likewise, we can write
  <pre><b>  if (a[2] == 0)
    ...some statement</b></pre>
  which checks to see whether or not zero was stored in the array object
    referred to by  <b>a</b>, at index <b>2</b>. 
 <p>
  Note that <b>a</b> is of type <b>int[]</b> (pronounced <i>int array</i>);
    any access to a member stored in an index of <b>a</b> is of type
    <b>int</b>.
  Generally, if <b>a</b> is of type <b>T[]</b> (pronounced <i>t array</i>),
    then any access to a member stored in an index of <b>a</b> is of type
    <b>T</b>.
  <p>
  The golden rule of arrays says, <i>"Do unto any array member as you would do
    unto a variable of the same type"</i>.
  So wherever we can use an <b>int</b> variable, we can use an <b>int[]</b>
    member.
  Thus, we can write <b>a[2] = 8;</b>, using <b>a[2]</b> on the left side of
    the <b>=</b> state-change operator (changing the value stored in index
    <b>2</b> from <b>0</b> to <b>8</b>).
  We can even write <b>a[2]++;</b>, which increments the value stored in index
    <b>2</b> of the array.
  So, when you ask yourself the question, "Can I use access an array member and
    use it here?", the question simplifies to, "Can I use a variable (of the 
    same type) here?"
  <p>
  In fact, the value written inside the brackets can be any expression that
    evaluates to an <b>int</b>; we will see how variables and more complicated
    expressions are used for  indexing arrays later in this lecture.
  For now, note that writing <b>a[a.length-1] = 0;</b> stores <b>0</b> in the
    last index of the array object. 
  <p>
  Note that when accessing a member in an array, if the value computed for the
    index is less than 0, or greater than OR EQUAL TO the length of the array,
    then trying to access the member at that index causes Java to throw the
    <b>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</b> which contains a message showing what
    index was attempted to be accessed.
  So, writing <b>a[a.length] = 0;</b> throws this exception, since the index
    <b>5</b> is not in the array object.
  <p>
  Finally, here is a picture that shows how to declare a variable refering to
    an array object, but this time the array object stores a <b>String</b> in
    each index.
  After this declaration are three expression statements that intialize these
    indexes with new <b>String</b> objects.
<p>

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%">&nbsp</td>
<td width ="80%">
  Although indexes are always integers, the values stored at each index 
    depends on the type used to declare/construct the array.
  In this example, each index stores a reference to a <b>String</b> object.
  Finally, using what we learned above, we could have declared and intialized
    this variable and its array object in just one declaration: by either
</tbody>
</table>
  <pre><b>String[] s = new String[]{new String("ABC"), new String("LMN"), new String("XYZ")};</b></pre>
  <pre><b>String[] s = new String[]{"ABC", "LMN", "XYZ"};</b></pre>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%">&nbsp</td>
<td width ="80%">
  The second, more simple, declaration is correct because of the special
   property of <b>String</b> literals that they construct their own objects.
  <p>
  Note that because of the golden rule, we can use <b>s[0]</b> just like any
    variable of type <b>String</b>; therefore, we can write the expression
    <b>s[0].length()</b> which returns 3 (the length of the <b>String</b>
    object referred to in index <b>0</b> in the <b>String</b> array <b>s</b>).
  So generally, when arrays store references to objects in their indexed
    members, we can call an appropriate method (based on the type of the
    reference) on any member in the array.
  Here we can call any <b>String</b> method on any object stored in this array.

<!-- Processing Arrays -->

<a name="ProcessingArrays"><hr align="left" width="33%">
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Processing Arrays</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  Most code that processes an array does so by iterating through it: looking at
    the value stored in each indexed member in the array object.
  Typically, a <b>for</b> loop is used to generate all the indexes for the
    array object.
  Study the following code carefully; although short, it contains all the
    fundamentals that you need to understand for writing array processing code.
  This code computes the sum of all the values in an <b>int[]</b>.
  <pre><b>  int sum = 0;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;a.length; i++)
    sum += a[i];
  System.out.println("Sum = " + sum);</b></pre>
  Below is a (non-compact) trace table that illustrates the hand simlation of
    this code.
  Notice how the same statement <b>sum += a[i];</b> is repeatedly executed,
    but it has a slightly different meaning every time, because the value
    stored in <b>i</b> changes, so the indexed member being added to <b>sum</b>
    is always different.
  <p>
  <img src="images/sumtrace.gif"></image>
  <p>
  Notice the <b>for</b>'s continuation test: <b>i&lt;a.length</b>.
  When the length is <b>5</b> (as in this example), the final <b>i</b> for
    which the body is executed is <b>4</b>(the highest index in the array);
    when <b>i</b> increments to <b>5</b>, the test is <b>false</b> for the
    first time, so the body is not executed, and instead the loop is
    terminated.
  We can write this test as <b>i&lt;=a.length-1</b>, which has the same meaning,
    but few "real" programmers write the test this way.
  <p>
  The following code prints on one line, separated by spaces, all the values
    stored in an array.
  After all the values are printed (and the loop terminates), it ends the line.
  Notice that the same <b>for</b> loop code is used (this time to examine and
    print, not add together) every member stored in the array object; only the
    body of the loop (telling Java what to do with each indexed member) is
    different.
  <pre><b>  for (int i=0; i&lt;a.length; i++)
    System.out.print(a[i]+" ");
  System.out.println();</b></pre>
  <p>
  Below, a more interesting version of this loop prints a comma-separated list
     of values stored in the array: the last one is not followed by a comma,
     but by a new line.
  The <b>String</b> to catenate is decided by a conditional expression.
  <pre><b>  for (int i=0; i&lt;a.length; i++)
    System.out.print( a[i]+(i&lt;a.length-1?",":"\n") );</b></pre>
  <p>
  The following code prompts the user to fill in each value in an array.
  Notice that the same <b>for</b> loop code is used (this time to store into
    every indexed member in the array object); again, only the body of the
    loop is different.
  <pre><b>  for (int i=0; i&lt;a.length; i++)
    a[i] = Prompt.forInt("Enter value for a["+i+"]");</b></pre>
  <p>
  The following code computes and prints the maximum value stored in an array.
  Because the original maximum value comes from index <b>0</b> in the array
    (the first value stored in the array), the <b>for</b> loop starts at index
    <b>1</b> (the second value stored in the array).
  <pre><b>  int max = a[0];
  for (int i=1; i&lt;a.length; i++)
    if (a[i]>max)
      max = a[i];
  System.out.println("Max = " + max);</b></pre>
  We also could have also written this code as follows, initializing
    <b>max</b> to <b>Integer.MIN_VALUE</b> and starting the <b>for</b> loop at
    index <b>0</b>, guaranteeing <b>a[0]</b>'s value will be stored into
    <b>max</b> during the first loop iteration.
  <pre><b>  int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;a.length; i++)
    if (a[i]>max)
      max = a[i];
  System.out.println("Max = " + max);</b></pre>
  <p>
  Examine the Javadoc for the <b>Integer</b> class to learn about this
    <b>public static final int</b> value.
  Then, hand simulate this second loop to understand why/how it works.
  In fact, we could replace the <b>if</b> statement by either
    <b>max = Math.max(max,a[i]);</b> or 
    <b>max = (a[i]>max ? a[i] : max);</b> and compute the same result,
    although I prefer the <b>if</b> statement.
  <p>
  Finally, the following code loads all the information from a file into an
    array.
  We often perform this operation early in a proagram, and then process the
    information in the array one or more times, beause it is easier to
    manipulate the information in an array than a file.
  To work, the file must first store the length of the array needed; it is read
    first and used to construct an array object exactly the right size to
    store all the remaining values.
  Then, we must read the remaining values from the file individually, and
    store them into the array.
  <pre><b>  TypedBufferReader tbr = 
    new TypedBufferReader("Enter file to load in array");
  String[] s = new String[tbr.readInt()];
  for (int i=0; i&lt;a.length; i++)
    a[i] = tbr.readString();
  tbr.close();</b></pre>
  Note that we have omitted a <b>try</b>/<b>catch</b> block for catching
    exceptions: we are assuming that the file contains all correct data, and
    we never try to read past the last data value in the file.
  Of course, writing this code in a block allows us to decide how to handle
     exceptions (wrong type of data, not enough data, etc).
  <p>
  The <a href="../../programs/arraydemo.zip">Array Demonstration</a>
    application contains all the code described in this section (and more).
  Please download, unzip, run, and examine this code (it is discussed again
    in the secion illustrating how arrays appear in the Eclipse debugger).

  A brief observation.
  The <b>String</b> reference type also has "array-like" properties:
    a <b>String</b> is a sequence of characters and you can access the
    individual <b>char</b>s in a <b>String</b>.
  There are a few relevant differences to know (also check out this material
    in Sun's Javadoc for the <b>String</b> class).
  Assume that we declare <b>String s = "ABC";</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Unlike arrays, <b>String</b>s employ a <b>public int length</b> method
          (not a <b>public</b> instance variable) for accessing the length of
          the <b>String</b>.
        Thus we must write something like <b>s.length()</b> (which returns
          <b>3</b>); this inconsistency is foolish.
    <li>Unlike arrays, <b>String</b>s employ a <b>charAt</b> method (not
          <b>[]</b>) for accessing the <b>char</b> at a specified index in the
          <b>String</b> (e.g., <b>s.charAt(0)</b>, which is <b>'A'</b>.
        Because this class is immutable, there is no way to change the
          character stored at an index.
    <li>Unlike arrays, when accessing an illegal index in a <b>String</b> (with
           <b>charAt</b>), Java throws <b>StringIndexOutOfBoundsException</b>
           (not <b>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</b>).
  </ul>
  We often think about processing the members in a <b>String</b> using the same
    techniques (a <b>for</b> loop) as when processing members in an array.
  For example, here is a typical loop for processing all the characters a
    <b>String</b>: it adds up the ASCII values of all the characters.
    <pre><b>  String s = Prompt.forString("Enter Name");
  int asciiCharSum = 0;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;s.length(); i++)
     asciiCharSum += s.charAt(i);  //Implicit conversion char->int
  System.out.println(s +"'s ASCII sum = " + asciiCharSum);</b></pre>
  Hand simulate this code with the input <b>HOLYBIBLE</b> or <b>al gore</b>.

<!-- Array Methods -->

<td width ="20%"><b>Array Methods</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  It is often convenient to move array processing operations into methods.
  In this section, we will show how to write <b>public static</b> methods
    that process arrays (we can put such methods in our application, or in
    a library class); then we will exame non-<b>static</b> methods for
    processing arrays that are stored as instance variables.
  <p>
  The first method finds and returns the lowest index that stores the
    <b>String</b> value specified by the second parameter.
  Note the form of the parameter variable for the array: it is the same as
    declaring a local variable of the <b>String[]</b> type.
  <pre><b>  public static int findLowestIndexOf(String[] a, String value) {
    for (int i=0; i&lt;a.length; i++)
      if (a[i].equals(value))
        return i;

    return -1;
  }</b></pre>
  Here the code immediately returns the value stored in <b>i</b> if it finds an
    <b>i</b> such that <b>a[i]</b> stores the same (<b>.equals</b>)
    <b>String</b> as <b>value</b>; there is no reason to search any further.
  By standard convention, returning <b>-1</b> means <b>value</b> was not found
    in <b>a</b> (since <b>-1</b> is NEVER a legal index in an array).
  This method returns <b>-1</b> only after it discovers that no member in the
    array store <b>value</b>.
  Note the use of two <b>return</b> statements, which I believe simplify this
    code (don't agree? try writing this method with only one <b>return</b> and
    show it to me if it is simpler).
  <p>
  The next method returns whether every member in the array stores 0.
  It has a similar test/return structure as <b>findLowestIndexOf</b>.
  <pre><b>  public static boolean all0(int[] a) {
    for (int i=0; i&lt;a.length; i++)
      if (a[i] != 0)
        return false;

    return true;
  }</b></pre>
  Here the code immediately returns <b>false</b> as soon as it finds a non-0
     member in the array (there is no reason to search any further).
  This method returns <b>true</b> only after it discovers that every member
    in the array does store a <b>0</b>.
  <p>
  I often see beginners write such code as follows.
  This code is more complicated and slower than the code above: it is terrible.
  If you want to be a programmer, avoid overly complicated and slow code.
  <pre><b>  public static boolean all0(int[] a) {
    int count0s = 0;                     //terrible code
    for (int i=0; i&lt;a.length; i++)       //terrible code

  The next method determines whether an array is stored in increasing order
    (technically, non-decreasing order, because we ensure only that a
    subsequent value is no smaller than -at least as big as- the preceeding
    one).
  Note the interesting <b>for</b> loop bounds, and the interesting use of the 
    index in the body of the loop.
  If an array stores N values, we must compare N-1 pairs of values to compute
    this answer.
  For the first iteration, we are comparing <b>a[0]>a[1]</b>; for the last
    iteration we care comparing <b>a[a.length-2] > a[a.length-1]</b>, which
    is comparing the next-to highest index with the highest one in the array.
   <pre><b>  public static boolean increasing(int[] a) {
    for (int i=0; i&lt;a.length-1; i++)
      if (a[i] > a[i+1])
        return false;

    return true;
  }</b></pre>
  Here the code immediately returns <b>false</b> as soon as it finds a member 
    in the array that is followed by a smaller value (there is no reason to
    search any further).
  This method returns <b>true</b> only after it discovers that every member
    (but the last) in the array is followed by a value that is at least as big.
  <p>
  The following three-parameter method swaps the values in positions
    <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> in array <b>a</b>.
   <pre><b>  public static void swap(int i, int j, int[] a) {
    int temp = a[i];
    a[i] = a[j];
    a[j] = temp;
  }</b></pre>
  We can illustrate an example of a call to this method using the following
    call frame.

  Notice that this method changes the state of the array object whose
    reference it is passed.
  The argument <b>x</b> still refers to the same object (the method cannot
    change what object it refers to), but the state of that object has been
    changed inside the method.
<p>
  Finally, here is an interesting method: interesting because it returns
    a new array object.
  The <b>lengthAtLeast</b> method takes a <b>String[]</b> as a parameter and
     returns another <b>String[]</b> as a result: the returned result contains
     only those  <b>String</b>s from the parameter array that are at least
     <b>n</b> characters long (specified by the second parameter).
  <pre><b>  public static String[] lengthAtLeast(String[] a, int n) {
    int answerLength = 0;
    for (int i=0; i&lt;a.length; i++)
      if (a[i].length() > n)
        answerLength++;

    String[] answer  = new String[answerLength];
    int      answerI = 0;
    for (int i=0; i&lt;a.length; i++)
      if (a[i].length() > n)
        answer[answerI++] = a[i];  //Note the different values used for indexes

    return answer;
  }</b></pre>
  This method works by first determining how many values must be returned.
  Then it declares an array with exactly that length.
  Next it fills the array with the required values: notice how the
    postfix <b>++</b> operator returns as a result the original value
    of <b>answerI</b> but also increments it for the next interation.
  Finally the method returns the new array it constructed and filled.
  <p>
  Assume that we declare
   <b><pre> String[] s = new String[]{"a", "ab", "abc", abcd", "abcde"}</pre></b>
  We can then write <b>String[] special = lengthAtLeast(s,3);</b> or even
    <b>s = lengthAtLeast(s,3);</b> if we never need to access the original
    array object (making <b>s</b> now refer to the one <b>lengthAtLeast</b>
    constructed.

<td width ="20%"><b>Arrays Instance Variables</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  We can also write classes that define arrays for their instance variables,
    constructors that intialize them, and methods that process these intialized
    instance variables.
  In fact, the <b>DiceEnsemble</b> class (not <b>SimpleDiceEnsemble</b>)
    does extactly this.
  It defines just three instance variables:
  <b><pre>  private int   sidesPerDie;
  private int   rollCount;
  private int[] pips;</pre></b>
  Here, the <b>pips</b> array stores the number of pips showing on each of
    the dice in the ensemble.
  Recall from our original pictures (which will now make more sense, because
    we know about array objects)
    that we illustrated the declaration of
    <b><pre>  DiceEnsemble d1 = new DiceEnsemble(2,6);</pre></b>
  by
<p>
</tbody>

   <img src="images/diceobject.gif"></image>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%">&nbsp</td>
<td width ="80%">
  The constructor for this class reinitializes <b>sidesPerDie</b> and
    <b>pips</b> (<b>rollCount</b> is declared to store <b>0</b>).
  <b><pre>  public DiceEnsemble (int numberOfDice, int sidesPerDie)
    throws IllegalArgumentException {
    if (numberOfDice < 1)
      throw new IllegalArgumentException
        ("DiceEnsemble constructor: Number of dice ("+numberOfDice+") < 1"); 
    if (sidesPerDie < 1)
      throw new IllegalArgumentException
        ("DiceEnsemble constructor: Sides per die ("+sidesPerDie+") < 1"); 

    this.sidesPerDie  = sidesPerDie;
    this.pips         = new int[numberOfDice];
    //No name conflict for pips; we could write: pips = new int[numberOfDice]
  }</pre></b>
    which reinitializes the instance variable <b>sidesPerDie</b> with the
      value of the second parameter and
    reinitializes the instance variable <b>pips</b> (by using the first
      parameter) to refer to an array that is exactly the right length to
      contain values for each of the dice in the ensemble.
  Once these instance variables are initialized, the <b>getNumberOfDice</b>
    method becomes just
  <b><pre>  public int getNumberOfDice ()
  {return pips.length;}</pre></b>
  So, there is no need to use another instance variable to store the number
    of dice; that information is already stored in -and can be accessed via-
     the <b>public final int length</b> instance variable of the <b>pips</b>
     array.
  <p>
  Likewise, the <b>roll</b> mutator/command becomes simply needs to 
    increment <b>rollCount</b> and fill in every member in the array to which
    <b>pip</b> refers with new and random pip values for the dice.
  <b><pre>  public DiceEnsemble roll () {
    rollCount++;
    for (int i=0; i&lt;pips.length; i++)
      pips[i]  = (int)Math.round(Math.random()*sidesPerDie + .5); 
    return this;
  }</pre></b>
  Many other methods use the <b>pip</b> array to compute their results.
  After <b>roll</b> has stored new pips, the <b>getPipSum</b> method
    becomes just
  <b><pre>  public int getPipSum ()
    throws IllegalStateException {
    if (rollCount == 0)
      throw new IllegalStateException
        ("getPipSum called, but dice not rolled");

    int pipSum = 0;
    for (int i=0; i&lt;pips.length; i++)
      pipSum += pips[i];
    return pipSum;
  }</pre></b>
  which adds up all the values in the <b>pips</b> array.
  Notice that this method declares a local variable <b>pipSum</b>.
  Why is this not declared as an instance variable?
  Because this information is used only while the method is executing;
    after that, its values can be forgotten, therefore there is no need
    to store it as an instance variable.
  Generally, if a variable can be declared locally instead of as an
    instance variables, that is to be preferred.
  <p>
  Finally, the <b>getPips</b> method is also simple, but a bit subtle.
  <b><pre>  public int getPips (int dieIndex)
     throws IllegalStateException, IllegalArgumentException {
    if (rollCount == 0)
      throw new IllegalStateException
       ("getPip called, but dice not rolled");

    if (dieIndex < 1 || dieIndex > pips.length)
      throw new IllegalStateException
        ("getPip called, but dieIndex("+dieIndex+
         ") is not in the range [1,"+pips.length+"]");

    return pips[dieIndex-1];
  }</b></pre>
  It first checks for either no rolls or a <b>dieIndex</b> that is not legal;
    it is not in the range <b>[1..number of dice]</b>; in either case, it
    throws an exception.
  Otherwise it returns the pips showing on the die specified by
    <b>dieIndex</b>: die <b>1</b> is stored in array index <b>0</b>,
    die <b>2</b> is stored in array index <b>1</b>, etc.; which is
    why the subtraction occurs in the index calculation.
  <p>
  So, it is easy to declare array instance variables in classes, initialize 
    them in constructors, and manipulate them in non-<b>static</b> methods.
  I recommend that you examine how the other methods in the <b>DiceEnsemble</b>
   class work with the <b>pips</b> array instance variable.

  The Eclipse debugger easily displays arrays in the <b>Variables</b> pane.
  Recall that the disclosure box in the debugger allows us to observe each
    instance variable in an object; for arrays it displays each index and the
    indexed member stored in the array.
  Surprisingly, the debugger doesn't display the <b>length</b> instance
    variable, but we can infer its value from the index of the last member
    shown.
  <p>
  As with any object, the array's indexed members are available by clicking on
    the disclosure box (plus sign); doing so changes the contents of this box
    (to minus sign) and discloses the indexes and their members in the array.
  Of course, if the array members themselves refer to objects, they too
    will have their own disclosure boxes, which we can click to disclose
    further information about these objects.
  <p>
  The sample program declares
  <pre><b>  int   howBig = Prompt.forInt("Enter length for the array");
  int[] a      = new int[howBig];</b></pre>
  If we enter <b>5</b> at the prompt, the <b>Variables</b> pane in the
    debugger shows
  <p>
  <img src="images/debug1.gif"></image>
  <p>
  Note that <b>a</b> is not yet shown, because it has not been declared.
  After <b>a</b>'s declaration is executed, the debugger shows
  <p>
  <img src="images/debug2.gif"></image>
  <p>
  Now <b>a</b> appears; its value shows as <b>int[5]</b>, which means a five
    element <b>int</b> array.
  Ignor the <b>id</b> part of the value.
  If we click the disclosure box (plus sign), it changes into a minus sign,
    and discloses all the indexes and their members in the array.
  <p>
  <img src="images/debug3.gif"></image>
  <p>
  Here all the array values are shown to store zero initially, because that
    is the default for <b>int</b> instance variables, and the members of arrays
    are much like these.
  After prompting the user for a new value to store in each index (I entered
    <b>3</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>-5</b>, <b>7</b>), the debugger shows
  <p>
  <img src="images/debug4.gif"></image>
  <p>
  These values are all highlighted in yellow, because I set a breakpoint after
    the entire input loop, executing it completely before the debugger stops.

  Finally, arrays and classes act together synergistically.
  A class is a heterogeneous data type: it defines any number of instance
    variables, each declared with its own individual name to store a different
    type of value.
  An array is a homogeneous data type: it defines one name storing an arbitrary
    number of indexed values, all declared to store the same type of value.
  <p>
  Combinations of arrays and classes have all the descriptive power that we
    need to model almost any kind of information in the computer.
  As the semester progresses, we will see more sophisticated uses of arrays and
    classes combined: e.g., an array where each of its members is an object
    from a class (and inside each object in the class is an instance variable
    in which an array of other values is stored).
  <p>
  Before continuing with our discussion of arrays as instance variables in
    collection classes, we take short detour to discuss four related topics:
    wrapper classes, the <b>Object</b> class, the <b>instanceof</b> operator,
    and reference casting.

<!-- Wrapper Classes -->

<a name="Wrapper"><hr align="left" width="33%">
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Wrapper Classes</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  Java provides four <b>wrapper classes</b>, one for each of the four
    primitive types in Java.
  Their names are <b>Integer</b>, <b>Double</b>, <b>Character</b>, and
    <b>Boolean</b> (note the standard capitalization for class names).
  All these classes are defined in the <b>java.lang</b> package.
  The main purpose of each wrapper class is to be able represent a primitive
    value as an object: one that contains just that primitive value as its
    state.
  Each class has a constructor whose parameter is a primtive; each has a
    method that returns the value of the primitive stored in the constructed
    object (<b>intValue</b>, <b>doubleValue</b>, <b>charValue</b>, and
     <b>booleanValue</b> name these methods respectively).
  Objects of these classes are immutable, so once an object is constructed the
    primitive it stores never changes.
  Examine the Javadoc pages for these wrapper classes; observe their many
    constructors and methods (all accessors/queries).
  <p>
  So, for example, we can define <b>Integer x = new Integer(10);</b>
    the variables <b>x</b> now stores a reference to an object constructed
    from the <b>Integer</b> class whose state is <b>10</b>.
  We cannot write <b>x+1</b> because <b>x</b> is not an <b>int</b> but is
    an <b>Integer</b>, and there is no prototype for <b>+</b> that adds
    an <b>Integer</b> to an <b>int</b>.
  But, we can write <b>x.intValue() + 1</b> because the <b>intValue</b> method
    returns an <b>int</b>: the one stored in the object <b>x</b> refers to.
  <p>
  Because wrapper classes are immutable, there is no way to increment the
    primitive value that is stored in the object <b>x</b> refers to.
  But, we could write <b>x = new Integer(x.intValue()+1)</b> whose execution
    is illustrated below.
  <p>
</tbody>

   <img src="images/incinteger.gif"></image>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%">&nbsp</td>
<td width ="80%">
  After executing this statement, the value in the object <b>x</b> refers to
    is one bigger: but instead of changing the state of the original object,
    <b>x</b> now refers to a different one.
  When we discuss increasing the length of an array, we will see a similar
    solution.
  <p>
  Wrapper classes also define various other useful information (and sometimes,
    quite a lot).
  For example, we have seen that the <b>Integer</b> class stores the
    <b>static final int</b> values <b>MIN_VALUE</b> and <b>MAX_VALUE</b>;
    it also stores the <b>static int</b> method <b>parseInt</b>): e.g.,
    <b>int i = Integer.parseInt("123");</b>
  <p>  
  From what we know of Java so far, there is no reason to use wrapper classes!
  But, we are about to explore two simple but general collections, stack and
    queue, which can store only references to objects, and not primitives.
  In this context, if we want to store a primitive value in such collections,
    we must first wrap it in an object (using a constructor of the appropriate
    wrapper class), and store a reference to that object in the collection.

<!-- The Object Class -->

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>The Object Class</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  The <b>Object</b> class in Java is a very special class.
  When we learn about inheritance hierarchies, we will see that this class is
    special because it is at the root of the inheritance hierarchy: every
    class in Java is an extension/specialization of the <b>Object</b> class.
  (You can see this trivially if you look at the Javadoc for any other class:
    it will always show <b>java.lang.Object</b> as the first class in
    the hierarchy.)
  This class is defined in the <b>java.lang</b> package.
  For now, though, we will concentrate on just two salient facts about the
    <b>Object</b> class, discussed below.
  <p>
  We can specify <b>Object</b> as the type of a variable: this includes local
     variables, parameter variables, instance variables -and now, even the
     type stored as the indexed members in array variables.
  If we declare a variable to be of the <b>Object</b> type...
  <ol>
    <li>The variable can store a reference to an object constructed from any
          class.
      <li>The only methods that we can call on the variable are those methods
          defined in the <b>Object</b> class.
  </ol>
  We have always spoken of a reference variable storing a reference to a
    object constructed from a <b>compatible</b> class: up to now, this has
    always meant "constructed from the same class": e.g., Java ALLOWS
    <b>Timer t = new Timer();</b> but DOES NOT ALLOW
    <b>Timer t = new Rational(1,2);</b>
  Now, we see from the rule above that a variable declared to be of type
    <b>Object</b> can store any reference, because any reference is
    compatible with <b>Object</b>.
  <p>
  So, Java ALLOWS <b>Object o = new Object();</b> and
    <b>Object o = new Timer();</b> and
    <b>Object o = new Rational(1,2);</b>
  Note, though, that we still cannot store a value of a primitive type
    in such a variable: e.g., Java DOES NOT ALLOW
    <b>Object o = 10;</b> because it must store a reference value, not a
    primitive value.
  But remember that we can use wrapper classes to achieve an equivalent result:
    e.g., Java allows <b>Object o = new Integer(10);</b>
  <p>
  The <b>Object</b> class defines only about a dozen methods, of which
    <b>toString</b> is the only one that we have studied.
  Thus, Java allows calling <b>o.toString()</b> regardless of which
    ALLOWABLE declaration above we use.
  Regardless of what kind of object the reference in an <b>Object</b>
    variable refers to, we can call only <b>Object</b> methods on it.
  So, even if we wrote <b>Object o = new Integer(10);</b> Java DOES NOT ALLOW
    calling <b>o.intValue()</b> because <b>intValue</b> is not a method defined
    in the <b>Object</b> class.
  <p>
  Thus, using the type <b>Object</b> gives us power in one dimension but 
    restricts power in another.
  It is powerful because variables of this type can store (generic) references
    to any objects.
  But, it restricts us from calling all but a few methods on these variables.
  This balance of power will be explored throughout the rest of this lecture
    and addressed later, as the basis of inheritance hierarchies and
    polymorphic behavior.
  <p>
  There is an important distinction between the declared type of a variable
    and the class of the object to which it refers.
  There was no distinction before, because the type of a variable and
    the class of the object to which it refers were always the same.
  What seems like a small leak in this rule will turn into a mighty river
    as we discuss interfaces and inheritance hierarchies.
<!---
  Examine the following code
  <b><pre>  Object o;
  if (Math.random() < .5)
    o = new Rational(1,2);
  else
    o = new Integer(10);
  ...code using o</pre></b>
  We know after the <b>if</b> statement that <b>o</b> refers to an object
    constructed from either the <b>Raional</b> or <b>Integer</b> class.
  What methods should we be able to call on <b>o</b>? The methods defined in
    <b>Rational</b>? The methods defined in  <b>Integer</b>?
  Java (and we) cannot tell, because a random number determines what object
    reference is stored in <b>o</b>.
  Because of inheritance (both classes inherit from <b>Object</b>), the only
    methods thate we can guarantee are callable are those defined in the
    <b>Object</b> class.

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>The instanceof operator</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  We have learned that variables declared of type <b>Object</b> can store
    references to objects constructed from any class.
  Java provides a way for us to check whether a reference refers to an
    instance of a specified class.
  The <b>instanceof</b> operator (one of two operators in the Java that are
    also keywords) performs this operation, returning a <b>boolean</b> result.
  Its form of use is <b>x instanceof Integer</b>; it is a binary infix
     operator whose second operand is the name of a class.
  <p>
  When we learn about reference casting below, we will see statements like
  <b><pre>  if (x instanceof Integer)
  ...do something with x knowing it is a reference to an Integer</pre></b>
  Finally, Java considers <b>null</b> to not be an instance of any class (it
     refers to no instance of a class).
  So <b>null instanceof <i>C</i></b> returns <b>false</b> for any class
    <b><i>C</i></b>.
  Lets summarize our current understanding of the <b>instanceof</b> operator.
  If <b>r instanceof <i>C</i></b> returns <b>true</b> it means that
    <b>r</b> stores a non-<b>null</b> reference to an object constructed from
    class <b><i>C</i></b>; if it returns <b>false</b> it means that either
    <b>r</b> stores <b>null</b> or it stores a reference to an object
     constructed from a class other than <b><i>C</i></b>.

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Reference Casting</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  We have learned that we can store any reference into an <b>Object</b>
    variable.
  But once we do so, we can use the <b>Object</b> variable to call only
    methods defined in the <b>Object</b> class.
  We will now learn how to tell Java to treat a reference stored in an
    <b>Object</b> variable just like a reference to the class that the object
    it refers to was really constructed from (gulp! reread the previous
     sentence, it it tortuous).
  This allows us to use <b>Object</b> variables to call all the methods defined
    in that class of the object to which it refers..
  We will discuss this asymmetry in this lecture, and explore it further and
    deeper in the lectures on inheritance.
  <p>
  Assume that we define <b>Object o = new Integer(10);</b>
  Java DOES NOT ALLOW us to call <b>o.intValue()</b>; it would detect
    and report such an error at compile time.
  But Java DOES ALLOW us to call <b>((Integer)o).intValue()</b>.
  Here we are using reference casting to cast <b>o</b> to be a
    reference to an object of type <b>Integer</b> (which it is) and then we
    are calling the <b>intValue</b> method on that casted reference.
  In casting, we always write the type that we are casting TO in parentheses;
    here we are casting <b>o</b> to be of type <b>Integer</b>.
  We need the other (outer) parentheses because casting has a lower precedence
    than member selection (the dot operator), and we want to cast first.
  <p>
  When we cast an <b>Object</b> reference to another class, we are telling the
    Java compiler to act as though that reference really refers to an object
    from that class.
  Afterward, the Java compiler allows us to use the casted reference to call
    any methods defined in that class.
  When Java actually runs our code (after the program compiles correctly) it
    checks each cast: if Java discovers that the cast won't work  -that the
    reference doesn't really refer to an object from the specified
    class- then it throws the <b>ClassCastException</b> before trying to call
    the method.
  Java checks the cast by automatically using the <b>instanceof</b>
    operator: if the cast <b>(Integer)o</b> appears in our code, Java first
    checks <b>o instanceof Integer</b>, throwing an exception if this
    expression evaluates to <b>false</b>.
  (technically, if <b>o</b> stores <b>null</b> Java throws the
    <b>NullPointerException</b> before even checking <b>instanceof</b>.)
  <p>
  Thus, even given the declaration <b>Object o = new Integer(10);</b> we
    could write <b>((Double)o).doubleValue()</b> in our code.
  Because <b>o</b> is casted to a <b>Double</b>, the Java compiler allows
    us to call the <b>doubleValue()</b> method on it.
  But, whent the program runs, this cast will throw the
    <b>ClassCastException</b> because the cast fails: when Java checks
    <b>o instanceof Double</b> this expression evaluates to <b>false</b>.
  <p>
  Thus, we separate our understanding of casting into <b>Compile Time</b> and
     <b>Run Time</b> components.
  Assume that we write the cast <b>(<i>C</i>)o</b> in our code.
  <ul>
    <li><b>Compile time</b>: Java allows <b>o</b> to be treated as if it 
             refers to an object from class <b><i>C</i></b>.
           Specifically, we can call any methods defined from class
             <b><i>C</i></b> on it.
    <li><b>Run time</b>: Java checks the cast to make sure it is correct: that
             the casted reference really does refer to an object from class
             <b><i>C</i></b>
           If it does, the code continues executing; if it doesn't, Java throws
             <b>ClassCastException</b>.
  </ul>
  So, a cast is a promise that Java believes while it is compiling the program,
    but also checks while running the program.
  It is an excellent example of Reagan's statement about arms reduction
    treaties with the former Soviet Union: Trust but verify.
  <p>  
  We can explicitly use the <b>instanceof</b> operator to ensure that our
    code will never throw <b>ClassCastException</b>.
  We can write code like
  <b><pre>  if (o instanceof Integer) {
    Integer i = (Integer)o;
    ...use of i; e.g., i.intValue()
  }</pre></b>
  In this code, the cast cannot fail beause the block containing the cast is
    executed only when the <b>if</b>'s test, <b>o instanceof Integer</b>,
    evaluates to <b>true</b>.
  <p>
  Pragmatically, casting is most often performed by itself in a variable
    declaration, as illustrated above.
  As an example, most classes include an <b>equals</b> method that allows
    comparison with a reference to any object.
  For example, the <b>Rational</b> class should include an <b>equals</b>
    method defined by
<b><pre>  public boolean equals(Object other)
  {
    if ( !(other instanceof Rational) )   //From a different class?
      return false;
    if (other == this)                    //Is the same object?
      return true;                        //  no need to check fields!

    //Cast is guaranteed to work: other is instanceof Rational
    Rational otherRational = (Rational)other;

    //Check State (both fields)
    return this.numerator   == otherRational.numerator &&
           this.denominator == otherRational.denominator;
  }</pre></b>
  Most <b>equals</b> methods follow the same three-part strategy:
  <ol>
    <li>If the parameter is not a reference to an object of the correct type,
          it returns <b>false</b>.
    <li>If the parameter is <b>==</b> to <b>this</b>, then we are comparing
          an object to itself, in which case it returns <b>true</b>
          immediately, without checking the state of the object; we know that
          any object stores the same state as itself.
    <li>Otherwise, it legal to cast the parameter and store it in a local
          variable of the correct type; once that is done, the states of
          <b>this</b> object and the other one are compared.
  </ol>

<td width ="80%">
  Collection classes manage collections of values.
  They include methods to add values to the collection, remove values from the
    collection, and inquire about values in the collection.
  We use arrays to store these values, and unlike our previous discussion
    the arrays are not always filled.
  Generally, a collection class can be represented by two instances variables:
    one refers an array storing all the values in the collection; the other
    is an <b>int</b> that keeps track of how many indexed members in the array
    are actually being used.
  <p>
  In the rest of this lecture we will discuss two simple and well-known
    collection classes: stack and queue.
  These classes are useful in many programs that model real-world data and
    processes.
  Their definitions will heavily rely on the <b>Object</b> type: both in
     methods and for array instance variables.
  Such collections can be used, unchanged, in any programs that we write.
  This kind of generality and reusability is the holy grail of effective
    class design.
  <p>
  The stack and queue collections are straightforwad to implement.
  The straightforward implementation of the stack collection (which implements
    a last-in/first-out ordering) is efficient.
  But, the straightforward implementation of the queue collection (which
    implemements a first-in/first-out ordering) is not efficient; later in
    the semester we will examine a second, more complicated but efficient
    implementation of queues. 
  A fundamental component of both implementations is a <b>doubleLength</b>
     method to increase the length of the array storing the collection.
  <p>
  The <b>SimpleStack</b> and <b>SimpleQueue</b> classes that we cover in 
    this lecture (along with a simple driver application for each), are
    available online.

  We can visualize a stack as a vertical array, whose indexes increase as the
    array goes upward.
  The biggest index that stores a non-<b>null</b> reference is known as the
    <b>top</b> of the stack.
  Each <b>SimpleStack</b> object stores two instance variables: a reference to
     such an array and a value <b>top</b>.
  References are both added (pushed on) and removed (popped off) near the top 
   of the stack; this means that we characterize a stack as Last-In/First-Out:
    the last reference added to (pushed on) the stack is the first one removed
    (popped off).
  Such a stack is declared and initialized simply by
     <b>SimpleStack x = new SimpleStack();</b>
  The following picture shows a stack onto which three strings have been
     pushed.

  Also, we represent <b>null</b> by a slash (<b>/</b>), as appears in array
    index 3 in the picture above; we will continue to use this graphical
    notation throughout the rest of the course for <b>null</b> references.
  <p>
  The <b>SimpleStack</b> collection class consists of definitions (elided here,
     but fully shown in the discussion below) for the following constructors,
     methods, and fields.

<!-- Length Doubling -->

<a name="LengthDoubling"><hr align="left" width="33%">
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Length Doubling</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  Before looking at all the <b>public</b> constructors and methods, we 
    will examine the <b>private doubleLength</b> method, which is called
    only in <b>push</b>
  As we push more values onto a stack, the array storing these values must get
    bigger.
  Although the length of an array object cannot be changed once it has been
    constructed, the <b>doubleLength</b> method does the equivalent by
    constructing a new, bigger object; we used much the same approach to
    "increment" a variable refering to an immutable <b>Integer</b> object.
  Thes code for length doubling is quite simple, but subtle.
  <b><pre>  private void doubleLength ()
  {
    Object[] temp = new Object[stack.length*2];
    for (int i=0; i&lt;stack.length; i++)
      temp[i] = stack[i];
    stack = temp;
  }</pre></b>
  This method is called only when the array object that <b>stack</b> refers to
    is filled with references.
  It works in three steps:
  <ol>
    <li>It declares the local variable <b>temp</b> and initializes it to refer
          to a newly constructed array object whose length is twice as big as
          the length of the array <b>stack</b> refers to.
        Initially, all indexed members store <b>null</b>.
    <li>It copies all the non-<b>null</b> references from <b>stack</b> to
          <b>temp</b> in order (from <b>0</b> up to <b>top</b>).
    <li>It makes <b>stack</b> refer to the new object.
  </ol>
  Thus, for all intents and purposes, we have doubled the length of
    <b>stack</b>: it now refers to an array that stores the same values, but
    whose length (for storing new values) is twice as long.
  The picture below illustrates how this method executes.
<p>
</tbody>
</table>
   <img src="images/doublelength.gif"></image>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%">&nbsp</td>
<td width ="80%">
  Notice that <b>top</b> remains unchnaged at <b>1</b> because there are
    still only two references stored in the array (at indexed members
    <b>0</b> and <b>1</b>).
  The instance variable <b>stack</b> no longer refers to the old array object,
    so eventually Java will recycle this object.
  <p>
  Another, similar way to write this method (maybe a bit clearer than
    using <b>temp</b>) is
  <b><pre>  private void doubleLength ()
  {
    Object[] old = stack;
    stack = new Object[stack.length*2];
    for (int i=0; i&lt;old.length; i++)
      stack[i] = old[i];
  }</pre></b>
  <p>
  Although this class doesn't define it, I have written the <b>trimLength</b>
    method below.
  This method shrinks the array to be just big enough to store all the
    current references in <b>stack</b>.
  Here, the first line constructs a "just big enough" array and then the
    <b>for</b> loop copies all the references into it.
  <b><pre>  private void trimLength()
  {
    Object[] temp = new Object[top+1];
    for (int i=0; i&lt;=top; i++)
      temp[i] = stack[i];
    stack = temp;
  }</pre></b>
  We could likewise implement this method with <b>old</b> instead of
    <b>temp</b>.
  Note that we could include an <b>if</b> to immediately return if 
    <b>stack.length</b> were equal to <b>top+1</b>, but his code,
    while redundant, works.
  If we called <b>x.trimLength()</b> the actions in the picture above would be
    reversed.

<!-- Stack Implementation -->

<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Stack Implementation</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  We will now explore all the <b>public</b> constructors and methods in this
    class.
  You are invited to hand simulate this code and draw the relevant pictures
    to help you better understand it.
  We start with the definition of the general constructor.
  <b><pre>  public SimpleStack (int initialSize)
    throws IllegalArgumentException
  {
    if (initialSize < 1)
      throw new IllegalArgumentException
        ("SimpleStack Constructor: initialSize("+initialSize+") < 1");

    stack = new Object[initialSize];
  }</pre></b>
  Basically, this constructor verifies the <b>initialSize</b> parameter
    and then uses it to construct an array that can contain that many
    references.
  Recall that when arrays of references are constructed, all indexed members
    store <b>null</b>.
  Observe that <b>top</b> is declared to store <b>-1</b> initially, and no
    change is made to it here.
  We say that the stack is empty if it is in this state.
  In fact, it is a class invariant that there are always <b>top+1</b> values
    stored in the stack; so at constuction there are <b>0</b> values stored.
  Another explanation for this intial value will emerge when
    we study the code for the <b>push</b> method.
  <p>
  The second constructor has no parameter and constructs an array with
    enough room for just one value.
  It is written simply as
  <b><pre>  public SimpleStack ()
  {this(1);}</pre></b>
  Unless we know  something special about how many values we will push on
    a stack, we will often use this simpler constructor.
  <p>
  The <b>makeEmpty</b> method removes all references from the stack and 
    reinitializes <b>top</b> to <b>-1</b>; so, after this method call the
    stack is again empty.
  We define this method, a mutator/command, by
  <b><pre>  public void makeEmpty ()
  {
    for (int i=0; i&lt;=top; i++)
      stack[i] = null;
    top = -1;
  }</pre></b>
  To understand this method, hand simulate it in the state illustrated in the
    picture above.
  Note that all indexed members greater than <b>top</b> already store
    <b>null</b>.
  <p>
  The <b>push</b> method, a mutator/command, adds a reference on top of the
    stack; the reference in its parameter <b>o</b> is stored one beyond the
    old top of the stack, and becomes the new top of the stack.
  It first checks to see if there is no more room in the array; if so, it
    doubles the length of the array as described above.
  Then it always increments <b>top</b> and stores the reference <b>o</b> at
    this new index in the array (there will always be room to store it).
<b><pre>  public void push (Object o)
  {
    if ( getSize() == stack.length)
      doubleLength();
        
    top++;
    stack[top] = o;        //or just stack[++top] = o;
  }</pre></b>
  Notice that a newly constructed <b>SimpleStack</b> stores <b>-1</b> in 
    <b>top</b>; the first time that this method is called it increments that
    value to <b>0</b> and then stores the parameter into the array at index
    <b>0</b>.
  Notice that the <b>if</b> calls <b>getSize</b> to check whether there is 
    not enough room for the new reference on the stack (we can worry about the
    details of this method later).
  Finally, notice that the semantics of the prefix operator <b>++</b> allows us
    to perform both state changes in a single statements:
    <b>stack[++top] = o;</b>
  <p>
  Because its parameter type is <b>Object</b>, we can call <b>push</b>
    with any argument that refers to an object.
  In fact, we can easily push different classes of objects onto the same stack,
    as illustrated below.
<p>

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" rules="none" width="100%">

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%">&nbsp</td>
<td width ="80%">
  The <b>pop</b> method, a mutator/command and accessor/queury, returns a
    reference to the object
    currently at the top of the stack, and it also removes that reference from
    the stack (replacing it by <b>null</b>); the value underneath it becomes
    the new top of the stack.
  Of course, if the stack is empty when this method is called, it throws
    <b>IllegalStateException</b> (the stack is in an illegal state to perform
    the <b>pop</b> operation).
  This code is written as
  <b><pre>  public Object pop () throws IllegalStateException
  {
    if ( isEmpty() )
      throw new IllegalStateException
        ("SimpleStack pop: Stack is empty");
    
    Object answer = stack[top];
    stack[top] = null;
    top--;                       //or just stack[top--] = null;
    return answer;
  }</b></pre>
  Notice how the reference at the top of the stack is stored in the local
    variable <b>answer</b>; then the old indexed member is set to <b>null</b>
    and <b>top</b> is decremented; then the stored <b>answer</b> is returned.
  Notice that the <b>if</b> calls <b>isEmpty</b> to check whether there is no
    value on the stack to be popped (we can worry about the details of this
    method later).
  Finally, notice that the semantics of the postfix operator <b>--</b> allows
    us to perform both state changes in a single statement:
    <b>stack[top--] = null;</b>
  <p>
  Notice that the <b>pop</b> method returns a reference of type <b>Object</b>.
  Recall that this means that the reference returned can refer to an object
    from any class.
  Obviously we can write <b>Object o = x.pop();</b> to store this reference,
    but we cannot do anything interesting with <b>o</b> (only call methods
    on it that are defined in the <b>Object</b> class).
  But, if we know the reference is to a <b>String</b> object, we can instead
    write <b>String s = (String)x.pop();</b>
  The cast here is mandatory, otherwise the Java compiler will detect and
    report an error.
  Recall that the member selector operator (the dot) has precedence over the
    cast; in this statement we want to apply the cast last, so we need no 
    extra grouping parentheses.
  <p>
  Finally, note the asymmetry: we can call <b>push</b> without casting
    (any argument reference stored to an <b>Object</b> parameter works); but
     when we call <b>pop</b>, we must cast the reference to do anything useful
     with it.
  Another way of saying this: putting a reference in a stack hides its type;
    when taking a reference out of a stack its type must be restored with a 
    cast.
  Of course, we can check its type with the <b>instanceof</b> operator.
  <p>
  Similarly, the <b>peek</b>, an accessor/query, returns the reference
     currently at the top of the stack (like <b>pop</b>) but it DOES NOT
     remove it (unlike <b>pop</b>).
  <b><pre>  public Object peek () throws IllegalStateException
  {
    if ( isEmpty() )
      throw new IllegalStateException("SimpleStack pop: Stack is empty");
    
    return stack[top];
  }</b></pre>
  The <b>isEmpty</b> accessory/query, used in <b>pop</b> and <b>peek</b>, 
    returns whether or not the stack is empty.
  It is written simply as
  <b><pre>  public boolean isEmpty ()
  {return top == -1;}</pre></b>
  Recall that in an empty stack, <b>top</b> stores <b>-1</b>.
  Another way to implement this method would be <b>return getSize() == 0;</b>
  <p>
  The <b>getSize</b> accessory/query, returns the number of references on the
    stack.
  It is written simply as
  <b><pre>  public int getSize ()
  {return top+1;}</pre></b>
  Recall that in an empty stack, <b>top</b> stores <b>-1</b>; in this case
    the value <b>getSize</b> returns is <b>0</b>.
  Recall that there is a class invariant that states there are always
    <b>top+1</b> values stored in the stack.
  <p>
  Finally, the <b>toString</b> method returns the value of <b>top</b>, the
    <b>length</b> of the <b>stack</b> array, and the <b>String</b> values
    of all the references in the stack.
  It uses lots of catenation to get the job done.
  <b><pre>  public String toString ()
  {
    String answer = "SimpleStack[top="+top+"/length="+stack.length;
    for (int i=0; i<=top; i++)
      answer += ";stack["+i+"]="+stack[i];
    answer +=  "]";
    
    return answer;
  }</pre></b>
  <p>
  In summary:
  Each <b>SimpleStack</b> stores the <b>stack</b> array (storing the references
    in the stack) and <b>top</b> (storing the index of the last reference).
  Generally, <b>push</b> increments <b>top</b> by 1 and <b>pop</b> decrements
     <b>top</b> by 1.
  So that the first <b>push</b> (or any <b>push</b> on an empty stack) stores
    its reference in index <b>0</b>.
  The number of references in the stack is always <b>top+1</b>; an empty stack
    stores <b>0</b> references so <b>top</b> in an empty stack must be
    <b>-1</b>.
  The size of the array is doubled when necessary (and it never shrinks).
  <p>
  Stacks are famous in Computer Science, because method calls are implements
     via stacks.
  When a method is called, it call frame (or the computer equivalent) is pushed
    onto the call stack.
  This is the same call stack that appears in a pane in the debugger (although
    it grows from the top downward).
  Each call to a method pushes that method onto the call stack; each return
    from a method pops that method off the call stack (returning to execute
     code at the new method on top of the call stack -the one that called the
     method that just returned).
  In fact, stacks are so common in computing (see the next section too) most
    computers have special instructions that push/pop a value onto/from a 
    hardware stack.

  We should now all masters of writing formulas as expressions in Java, and
    analyzing such expressions: we know about the precedence of operators,
    parentheses to override precedence, and left to right (or right to left)
    associativity.
  But now we ask the question, "Is that the simplest way to write expressions".
  The answer is no.
  In this section we shall discuss a simpler notation for writing expressions,
    and its relationship to stacks (which we use to evaluate such expressions
    easily).
  <p>
  The notation that we will learn to write expressions is called Reverse Polish
     Notation (RPN).
  The original Polish Notation was invented by a group of famous Polish
    logicians in the late 1930s.
  They wanted to prove things about expressions, and therefore wanted to invent
    the simplest rules possible to write arbitrary expressions.
  This group was wiped out in World War II, and the notation was rediscovered
    in the 1960s and used in the LISP programming language; many calculators
    also use RPN (as well as the programming language Forth).
  In Polish Notation, operators always appear before their operands; in RPN,
    operators always appear after their operands.
  <p>
  RPN is very simple: it has no operator precedence, no associativity rules,
    and no parentheses to override precedence and associativity rules!
  We evaluate an RPN expression (using oval diagrams) in a very straighforward
    manner, scanning it from left to right (we will ignore types here, and
    concetrate on values).
  <ol>

    <li>If the next token is an operator, use one big circle to enclose the

          and write the resulting value below the big circle.

  Note that one property of Java and RPN expressions is that the
    <i>operands</i> appear in the same order; the earlier an <i>operator</i> is
    applied in the Java expression (using all the complicated rules) the
    earlier it appears in RPN.
  Here is a picture illustrating the evaluation process for expressions written
     in RPN.

  We can use a stack to evaluate an expression written in RPN simply.
  We translate the circling rules into 
  <ol>
    <li>If the next token is a number, push it on the stack.
    <li>If the next token is an operator, pop the top two numbers off the
          stack, apply the operator to these values, and push the result value
          back on the stack.
  </ol>
  We can translate this algorithm to use a <b>StringTokenizer</b> to get
    all the tokens and a <b>SimpleStack</b> (always containing objects from
    the <b>Integer</b> wrapper class) to perform the computation.
  For example, if the operator were a plus, then we translate the second
   rule into the following code (note the casting).
  <b><pre>  Integer operand2 = (Integer)x.pop();
  Integer operand1 = (Integer)x.pop();
  x.push ( new Integer (operand1.intValue() * operand2.intValue()) );</pre></b>
  For non-commutative operators (<b>-</b> and <b>/</b>) we must realize the
    the second/right operand is on the top of the stack and the first/left
    operand is underneath it.

  We can visualize a queue as a horizontal array, whose indexes increase as the
     array goes rightward.
  The biggest index that stores a non-<b>null</b> reference is known as the
     <b>rear</b> of the queue.
  Each <b>SimpleQueue</b> object stores two instance variables: a reference to
     such an array and a value <b>rear</b>.
  References are added (enqueued) at the rear of the queue and removed
    (dequeued) from the front of the queue (always index <b>0</b>); this means
    that we characterize a queue as First-In/First-Out: the first reference
    added to the queue is also the first one removed.
  <p>
  Thus, a queue implements a "fair" line, where the first person getting into
    the line is the first person leaving the line to be served (with the others
    getting in line behind him/her).
  In fact, in England, people "queue up" to stand in a "queue" (just as we
    "line up" to stand in a "line").
  Such a queue is declared and initialized simply by
     <b>SimpleQueue x = new SimpleQueue();</b>
  The following picture shows a queue into which three strings have been
    enqueued.

  The <b>SimpleQueue</b> collection class consists of definitions (elided here,
     but fully shown in the discussion below) for the following constructors,
     methods and fields.
  <pre><b>  public SimpleQueue (int initialSize) throws IllegalArgumentException {...}

  Let's explore in detail the implementation of each constructor and method,
    in terms of how they manipulate the instance variables.
  The <b>doubleLength</b> method in this class is almost identical to the
    one we discussed in <b>SimpleStack</b>, but it refers to the instance
    variable <b>q</b>.
  Again, this method is called only when the array object that <b>q</b> refers
    to is filled with non-<b>null</b> references.

  <b><pre>  private void doubleLength ()

    Object[] temp = new Object[q.length*2];

<td width ="20%"><b>Queue Implementation</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  We now will explore all the <b>public</b> constructors and methods in this
    class.
  You are invited to hand simulate this code and draw the relevant pictures
    to help you better understand it.
  Most of these definitions are similar to those in the <b>SimpleStack</b>
    class; <b>pop</b> and <b>dequeue</b> are most different, implementing
    the last-in/first-out and first-in/first-out difference.
  So, make sure you read the description of this method carefully.
  We start with the definition of the general constructor.
  <b><pre>  public SimpleQueue (int initialSize)
    throws IllegalArgumentException
  {
    if (initialSize < 1)
      throw new IllegalArgumentException
         ("SimpleQueue Constructor: initialSize("+initialSize+") < 1");

    q = new Object[initialSize];
  }</pre></b>
  Basically, this constructor verifies the <b>initialSize</b> parameter
    and then uses it to construct an array that can contain that many
    references.
  Recall that when arrays of references are constructed, all indexed members
    store <b>null</b>.
  Observe that <b>rear</b> is declared to store <b>-1</b> initially, and no
    change is made to it here.
  We say that the queue is empty if it is in this state.
  In fact, it is a class invariant that there are always <b>rear+1</b> values
    stored in the queue; so at constuction there are <b>0</b> values stored.
  Another explanation for this intial value will emerge when
    we study the code for the <b>enqueue</b> method.
  <p>
  The second constructor has no parameter and constructs an array with
    enough room for just one value.
  It is written simply as
  <b><pre>  public SimpleQueue ()
  {this(1);}</pre></b>
  Unless we know  something special about how many values we will enequeue in
    a queue, we will often use this simpler constructor.
  <p>
  <p>
  The <b>makeEmpty</b> method removes all references from the queue and 
    reinitializes <b>rear</b> to <b>-1</b>; so, after this method call the
    queue is again empty.
  We define this method, a mutator/command, by
  <b><pre>  public void makeEmpty ()
  {
    for (int i=0; i&lt;=rear; i++)
      q[i] = null;
    rear = -1;
  }</pre></b>
  To understand this method, hand simulate it in the state illustrated in the
    picture above.
  Note that all indexed members greater than <b>rear</b> already store
    <b>null</b>.
  <p>
  The <b>enqueue</b> method, a mutator/command, adds a reference to the rear of
    the queue; the reference in its parameter <b>o</b> is stored one beyond the
    old rear of the queue, and becomes the new rear of the queue.
  It first checks to see if there is no more room in the array; if so, it
    doubles the length of the array as described above.
  Then it always increments <b>rear</b> and stores the reference <b>o</b> at
    this new index in the array (there will always be room to store it).
<b><pre>  public void enqueue (Object o)
  {
    if ( getSize() == q.length)
      doubleLength();
        
    rear++;
    q[rear] = o;        //or just q[++rear] = o;
  }</pre></b>
  Notice that a newly constructed <b>SimpleQueue</b> stores <b>-1</b> in 
    <b>rear</b>; the first time that this method is called it increments that
    value to <b>0</b> and then stores the parameter into the array at index
    <b>0</b>.
  Notice that the <b>if</b> calls <b>getSize</b> to check whether there is 
    not enough room for the new reference in the queue (we can worry about the
    details of this method later).
  Finally, notice that the semantics of the prefix operator <b>++</b> allows
    us to perform both state changes in a single statements:
    <b>q[++rear] = o;</b>
  <p>
  Because its parameter type is <b>Object</b>, we can call
    <b>enqueue</b> with any argument that refers to an object.
  <p>
  The <b>dequeue</b> method, a mutator/command and accessor/queury, returns a
    reference to the object currently at the front of the queue, and it also
    removes that reference from the queue by shifting all remaining values
    in the array left (towards the front) by one index position; this leaves
    duplicate references in <b>q[rear-1]</b> and <b>q[rear]</b>, so the last
    one is replaced by <b>null</b>).
  Of course, if the queue is empty when this method is called, it throws
    <b>IllegalStateException</b> (the queuen is in an illegal state to perform
    the <b>dequeue</b> operation).
  This code is written as
  <b><pre>    public Object dequeue () throws IllegalStateException
  {
    if ( isEmpty() )
      throw new IllegalStateException
        ("SimpleQueue dequeue: queue is empty");
    
    Object answer = q[0];
    
    //Shift all remaining values (q[1..rear]) left by 1 index, into
    //  positions  q[0..rear-1]
    for (int i=0; i&lt;rear; i++)
      q[i] = q[i+1];
   
    //Remove duplicate in q[rear]; it has been copied into
    //  q[rear-1] too 
    q[rear] = null;
    rear--;                 //or just q[rear--] = null;
    return answer;
  }</b></pre>
  Notice that the <b>if</b> calls <b>isEmpty</b> to check whether there is no
    value on the queue to be dequeued (we can worry about the details of this
    method later).
  Finally, note that the semantics of the postfix operator <b>--</b> allows us
    to perform both state changes in a single statement:
    <b>q[rear--] = null;</b>
  <p>
  This method is much different than the <b>pop</b> method for stacks, because
    it requires a <b>for</b> loo to examine every value in the array (as do the
    <b>makeEmpty</b> and <b>toString</b> methods in both classes).
  Thus, the amount of time that it takes to <b>dequeue</b> a value is
    dependent on the number of values already stored in the queue.
  This inefficiency can be eliminated by a more complicated class that 
    implements a queue: we will discuss it later in the semester.
  <p>
  Similarly, the <b>peek</b>, an accessor/query, returns the reference
     currently at the front of the queue (like <b>dequeue</b>) but it DOES NOT
     remove it (unlike <b>dequeue</b>).
  <b><pre>  public Object peek ()
    throws IllegalStateException
  {
    if ( isEmpty() )
      throw new IllegalStateException
        ("SimpleQueue peek: queue is empty");
    
    return q[0];  
  }</b></pre>
  The <b>isEmpty</b> accessory/query, used in <b>dequeue</b> and <b>peek</b>, 
    returns whether or not the queue is empty.
  It is written simply as
  <b><pre>  public boolean isEmpty ()
  {return rear == -1;}</pre></b>
  Recall that in an empty queue, <b>rear</b> stores <b>-1</b>.
  Another way to implement this method would be <b>return getSize() == 0</b>.
  <p>
  The <b>getSize</b> accessory/query, returns the number of references on the
    queue.
  It is written simply as
  <b><pre>  public int getSize ()
  {return rear+1;}</pre></b>
  Recall that in an empty queue, <b>rear</b> stores <b>-1</b>; in this case
    the value <b>getSize</b> returns is <b>0</b>.
  Recall that there is a class invariant that states there are always
    <b>rear+1</b> values stored in the queue.
  <p>
  Finally, the <b>toString</b> method returns the value of <b>rear</b>, the
    <b>length</b> of the <b>q</b> array, and the <b>String</b> values
    of all the references in the queue.
  It uses lots of catenation to get the job done.
  <b><pre>  public String toString ()
  {
    String answer = "SimpleQueue[rear="+rear+"/length="+q.length;
    for (int i=0; i<=rear; i++)
      answer += ";q["+i+"]="+q[i];
    answer +=  "]";
    
    return answer;
  }</pre></b>
  <p>
  In summary:
  Each <b>SimpleQueue</b> stores the <b>q</b> array (storing the references
    in the queue) and <b>rear</b> (storing the index of the last reference).
  Generally, <b>enequeue</b> increments <b>rear</b> by 1 and <b>dequeue</b>
     decrements <b>rear</b> by 1.
  So that the first <b>enqueue</b> (or any <b>enqueue</b> on an empty queue)
     stores its reference in index <b>0</b>.
  The number of references in the queue is always <b>rear+1</b>; an empty queue
    stores <b>0</b> references so <b>rear</b> in an empty queue must be
    <b>-1</b>.
  The size of the array is doubled when necessary (and it never shrinks).
  <p>
  A typical use of queues is in simulating systems where entities move from one
    part of the system to another, in a fixed order.
  For example, we might want to simulate a supermarket by getting data on when
    a customer enters, how long the customer shops in the store, how many items
    the customer buys, and how long it takes the customer to checkout (once
    he/she reaches the front of the checkout line).
  The only remaining piece of information missing is how long the customer
    waits in the checkout line.
  We can use queues (operating on this data) to simulate a variety of cash
    register configurations: some registers may restrict the number of items
    checked through.
  Then we can determine whether certain configurations are better than others
    (in terms of customer throughput).

<!-- Length Doubling Performance  -->

<tr valign="top">
<td width ="20%"><b>Length Doubling: Performance Analysis</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  Before finishing this lecture, we should do a short performance analysis of
    why doubling the length of an expanding stack/queue is a good strategy
    (say, compared to expanding it by increasing its length just by one).
  If we always expand the length of the array by one -the amount needed to
    store the new value, we would still be required to copy all the values
    each time we construct a new array.
  But, if we double the length of the array, we can put many new values into it
     without having to expand it and copy values.
  <p>
  For the analysis below, assume that a program reads from a file and pushes
    each value onto the top of a stack.
  For example, if we are reading 1,024 (2<sup>10</sup>) values from a file and
    pushing them onto the top of a stack; further assume that the stack is 
    initially constructed to refer to an array of length 1.
  <p>
  If we expand the length by just one, we will have to call the expand method
    999 times.
  The first time requires copying 1 value, the next time 2 values, the next 
    time 3 values, ... and the final time 1023 values.
  The total amount of copying is 1+2+...+1023 which is 523,776 copying
    operations!
  The general formula for 1+2+...+n is n(n+1)/2; os the number of copying
    operations grows as the square of the number of values we push.
  <p>
  Now let's analyze the doubling approach. 
  The first time requires copying 1 value, the next time 2 values, the next
    time 4 values, and the final time 512 values (when increasing the array
    from length 512 to length 1024).
  The total amount of copying is 1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128+256+512 which is only
    1,023 copying operations (over 500 times fewer than the previous method):
    so, if this method takes .1 second, the previous method almost takes a
    minute!
  If n is some power of 2, the formula for 1+2+4+...+n is 2n-1.
  <p>
  Thus, to push n values onto the top of a stack we must double the array only
    about Log<sub>2</sub>(n) times; note that logarithm (base 2) is a very
    slowly growing function: Log<sub>2</sub>(1,000) is 10;
    Log<sub>2</sub>(1,000,000) is 20; and Log<sub>2</sub>(1,000,000,000) is 30.
  <p>
  Of course, in the first approach, the array is always exactly the right size.
  With the second approach, we would have to call some kind of <b>trim</b>
    method to reduce it to exactly the right size.
  This would require copying every value again.
  In the previous example, it would require a total of 2,047 copy operations
    (still over 250 times faster than the first method).
  The exact formula is n+2<sup>Log<sub>2</sub>(n)+1</sup> -1.
  <p>
  The bigger the data file, the more efficient the doubling method is.
  For 1,000,000 values, the first method requires about 500,000,000,000
   (500 billion) copy operations; the doubling method requires only about
    3,000,000 (three millon) copy operations: that makes it 166,666 times
    faster).
  <p>
  When we formally study the Analysis of Algorithms we will perform more
    analyses like these for methods defined in collection classes.

           <b>Object o = s.pop().pop();</b>
    </ul>
<p>
<li>Explain why the following implementation of the <b>pop</b> method
    works correctly; notice that it use a <b>try</b>-<b>finally</b>
    combination with no local variable <b>answer</b>.

  <b><pre>  public Object pop () throws IllegalStateException
  {
    if ( isEmpty() )
      throw new IllegalStateException
        ("SimpleStack pop: Stack is empty");
    
    try{
      return stack[top];
    }finally{
      stack[top] = null;
      top--;                       //or just stack[top--] = null;
    }
  }</b></pre>
<p>
<li>Copying the form of the <b>equals</b> method in the <b>Rational</b> class
      (see the bottom of the <a href="#Casting">Reference Casting</a> section),
    write an <b>equals</b> method for <b>SimpleStack</b> or <b>SimpleQueue</b>
    Include all state criteria that you think is relevant.
<p>
<li>How could we change the <b>SimpleQueue</b> class to disallow enqueueing
     <b>null</b> references, either by not modifying the array and returning
     immediately, or by throwing an <b>IllegalArgumentException</b>.
