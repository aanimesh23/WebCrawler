"<b>Data Flow Analysis for Verifying Properties of Concurrent Programs</b>"</A>,
by Matthew B. Dwyer and Lori A. Clarke in
<i>Proceedings of the Second ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on Foundations of 
Software Engineering</i>,
New Orleans, LA, December 1994, pp. 62-75.

<H2> Abstract </H2>
In this paper we present an analysis approach based on data flow analysis 
that has the potential to provide cost-effective analysis of concurrent 
programs with respect to explicitly stated correctness properties. Using 
this approach, developers specify properties of concurrent programs as 
patterns of selected program events and choose whether the analysis should 
attempt to verify that all or no program executions satisfy the given 
property. We have developed a family of polynomial-time, conservative 
data flow analysis algorithms whose results can be used to address such 
questions. 
<P>

To overcome the traditional inaccuracies of static analysis, we have also 
developed a range of techniques for improving the accuracy of the results. 
Prior to analysis, refinements to the flow graph representation of the 
program, based on program and property specific information, increase the 
efficiency of the subsequent analysis and the accuracy of the results. 
During analysis, enforcement of feasibility constraints, which are based 
on the program being analyzed and the programming language in which it 
is written, improves the accuracy of the results. One strength of our 
approach is the flexibility allowed in choosing and combining these 
techniques so as to increase accuracy without making analysis time 
impractical. 

<P>

We have implemented a prototype toolset that automates the analysis for 
programs with explicit tasking and rendezvous style communication. We 
present preliminary experimental results using this toolset.
