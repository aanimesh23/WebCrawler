<H2> Abstract </H2>

The constrained expression approach to analysis of concurrent software 
systems has several attractive features, including the facts that it 
can be used with a variety of design and programming languages and that 
it does not require a complete enumeration of the set of reachable states 
of the concurrent system. This paper reports on the construction of a
toolset automating the main constrained expression analysis techniques and 
the results of experiments with that toolset. The toolset is capable of 
carrying out completely automated analyses of a variety of concurrent 
systems, starting from source code in an Ada-like design language and 
producing system traces displaying the properties represented by the 
analyst's queries. It has been successfully used with designs that 
involve hundreds of concurrent processes.
