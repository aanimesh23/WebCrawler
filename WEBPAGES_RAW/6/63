<H1>Hinged Dissections of Polyominoes</H1>

It's easy to cut one
<A HREF="../polyomino.html"><I>polyomino</I></A> (shape formed by joining 
squares edge-to-edge) into pieces that can be rearranged into any other 
polyomino with the same number of squares: just cut on the edges between 
squares.  But what if the pieces are to be joined together into a connected 
figure by hinges?  Can we make a device by joining polygons with hinges,
so that its hinges can be turned in different ways to form any polyomino?

<P>For tetrominoes (shapes made from four squares), we can again just cut 
on the edges between squares. If we connect four squares by three 
appropriately placed hinges, we can form all five possible 
tetrominoes:

</DIV>

<P>For higher-order polyominoes, the problem seems more difficult.
For instance, it does not seem to be possible to join five squares by 
hinges and form all twelve pentominoes.  However, we can still solve the 
hinged dissection problem by cutting the polyominoes into smaller pieces.

<P>My original solution used the following "ambivalent 
square":

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><P>
<IMG SRC="ambivalent-square.gif" WIDTH=292 HEIGHT=276 ALT="">
</DIV>

<P>The figure shows twelve hinged pieces arranged to form a square.  But 
because of the symmetric way in which the pieces are connected to each 
other, the same pieces can be folded into a square in a different way, in 
which the pieces at the top and bottom left corners of the figure have traded 
places.  A connected sequence
of 4<I>k</I> 
ambivalent squares forms a <I>universal dissection</I> that
can be folded into any <I>k</I>-omino.

<P>Erich Friedman then found a much simpler universal dissection:
Just take 2<I>k</I> isosceles right triangles,
hinged one to the next at their acute angles.
So the straight pentomino could be made by 10 such triangles:
<PRE>
    +--+--+--+--+--+
    |1/|\2|3/|\4|5/|
    |/0|9\|/8|7\|/6|
    +--+--+--+--+--+
</PRE>
You can even join the ends to make a ring of triangles!

<P>Erich and I now have a paper with Erik and Martin Demain,
at the 1999 Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry:
<A HREF="/~eppstein/pubs/p-hinged.html">Hinged Dissections of Polyominos
and Polyforms</A>.  In it, we describe this isosceles triangle construction,
and related constructions for hinging polyiamonds, polyhexes, polyabolos,
and similar shapes made from multiple copies of a single polygon.
