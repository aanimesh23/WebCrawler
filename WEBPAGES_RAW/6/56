					## Interviewing Basics
					- What are interviews good for?
					- What are interviews not fit for?
					- How do you prepare for an interview?
					- How do you conduct an interview?

				</section>

				<section data-markdown id="good">
					## What are interviews good for?
					- Eliciting requirements: understand your domain more
					- Developing personas: understand your users more
					- To prepare for a usability/design/development activity
						- open ended interview followed by a close ended interview
					- To follow up on a usability/design/development activity
						- e.g. follow up for a survey
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## What are interviews not fit for?
					- Collecting data from many users, interviews take time
					- Collecting data very quickly, interviews take time
					- Asking sensitive questions that might require anonimity.
					- Geography can play a small role as well.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Prepare for an interview
					### Steps
					1. Know why you are doing the interview. [...](#/good)
					2. Pick the right type of interview.
					3. Write down the interview.
					4. Practice the interview with each other.
					5. Assign roles for the interview.
					6. Collect all materials required for the interview.
					7. Recruit your users.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Why you are doing the interview. 

					- Define the goal of the interview. [...](#/good)
					- Eliciting Requirements?
						- "What does it mean to be X?"
						- "Does the data need to be secure?"
						- "What should the product do?"
						- "Why should the product do this?"
						- "What are you using now?"
						- Clarify any domain specific jargon or definitions.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Why you are doing the interview (2). 
					- Developing Personas?
						- "What should the product do?"
						- "What are you using now?"
						- "How do you do X now?"
						- Ask about the expertise of the user
						- "When do you use X the most?"
					- **Write out your questions as you are figuring this out!**
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Pick the right type of interview.

					- Unstructured
						- You are unsure of the kind of responses to expect.
						- You only have a general sense of what you want to cover.
						- Easy to follow up with the interviewee about an answer.
						- Data gathered is very rich.
						- More time spent per question.
						- You may not end up asking the same questions.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Pick the right type of interview (2).

					- Structured
						- You know exactly what to ask.
						- You know about the kind of responses to expect.
						- You ask the same questions.
						- You do not ask follow-up questions on the spot. 
						- Data gathered is more structured.
						- Takes lesser time.						
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Pick the right type of interview (3).
					- Semi-Structured
						- The best of both worlds: Exploratory and Well-defined.
						- You know exactly what to ask and cover.
						- You allow the interviewee to dwell deeper into details.
						- You ask follow-up questions on the spot. 
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Recruit your Participants.

					- Who would you ask?
						- potential users, administrators, developers
					- How many do you ask?
						- number of different kinds of users
						- number of personas you need to develop
						- number of domains involved
					- How do you ask?
						- Put up/email notices
						- Invite personally (?)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## 5 min Assignment
					1. Decide on 1 reason to interview  
					2. List 2 possible kinds of users whom you should interview.  
					3. List 2 other reasons for interviewing.  
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Write down the interview.

					- An interview is __not__ a conversation!
					- Write a **lead statement**
						- Goal of the interview
						- Checklist of Topics to be covered
						- Time required
					- Write down the **questions**
						- Frame the questions with proper language.
						- Keep the questions short, (20 words or less).
						- Break down long questions into simpler ones.
						- Remember: the interviewee is not reading these questions.
					- Write down the **closing remarks**.
					- Prepare a script (can simply be lead statement + questions + closing remarks)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## 5 min Assignment
					
					List 5 questions that you will ask your participants.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Practice the interview.

					- Test the questions.
						- clarity. questions easy to understand?
						- validity. questions asking what you think they are asking?
						- check your questions for bias.
							- "don't you think that X takes more time than Y?"
							- "does X take more time than Y?"
							- "which takes more time: X or Y?"
					- Time the interview.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Assign roles for the interview

					- Participant
					- Interviewer
					- Note Taker(s)
					- Videographer
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Collect all materials required for the interview.

					- Script (Lead statement, Questions, Closing remarks)
					- Laptop, Notebook, pen(cil) for note-taking,
					- Audio or video recorder (interviewee's consent)
					- Memory aids, e.g. calculators, calendars
					- Material useful for asking questions, e.g. screen shot of current system.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Conduct an interview
					- The Phases of an Interview
					- Things to keep in mind
					- Professionalism is a must!
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## The Phases of an Interview
					### Five Phases

					- 5–10 minutes: 		Introduction (greetings, instructions, overview)
					- 5–10 minutes: 		Warm-up (easy, non-threatening questions)
					- 85–100 (?) minutes: 	Body of the session (detailed questions)
					- 5–10 minutes: 		Cooling-down (summarize interview, easy questions)
					- 5 minutes:			Wrap-up (thank participant, leave/escort out)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## The Phases of an Interview
					### Other Phases to keep in mind
					- Simple to complex
					- More to less familiar (for the participant)
					- Open to Close? vice-versa?
				</section>


				<section data-markdown>
					## Things to keep in mind
					- Nonverbal responses
						- Facial expression
						- Body language
						- Take notes
					- Acknowledging 
						- be interested, but neutral
						- "uh-huh", "OK", "I see"
					- Paraphrasing
						- useful for your own checking.
						- shows that you are engaged.
						- "If I understand correctly", "Let me summarize everything so far"
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Things to keep in mind (2)
					- Probing
						- "tell me more about X"
					- Focusing, redirecting
						- "Show me" - keep things grounded in the specific
					- Keep on track
						- "That’s really interesting, but I have to get to these other questions before our time runs out."
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Professionalism is a must!
					- Be on time.
					- Be prepared.
					- Dress well.
					- Be polite.
					- Do not argue.
					- Do not force responses.
					- The participant is helping you. Not necessarily the other way around.
