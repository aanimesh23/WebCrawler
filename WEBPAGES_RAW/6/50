Comment:
1. Lots of minor edits
2. Revised definitions:
Removed "or an infinite number" from the definition of "Mapping".  (A definition
seemed like the wrong place to go into a discussion about binding loops.)
Removed definitions of  "strong reference" and "weak reference" 
Defined "Association".  
Revised definitions of "Binding", "Collection", and "Internal Member URI".
Collections contain bindings, not internal member URIs.  Internal member URIs
are derived objects, which come into existence when bindings are created and go
out of existence when bindings are deleted.
Edits throughout to make sure our usage is consistent with the definitions.
3. Simplified diagrams by removing "state" and removing objects not referenced
in the accompanying text.
4. Removed everything related to DAV:refintegrity and the Ref-Integrity header,
as well as general discussions of referential integrity.  The assumptions are
now that the integrity of bindings is guaranteed, and that the integrity of
redirect references is not guaranteed.  Clients don't get any control or
information about referential integrity.
5. Changed Ref-Target to Destination in contexts related to BIND.  Changed
definition of Ref-Target to remove references to its use in BIND requests.
6. Edits throughout to make sure there are no duplicate normative statements.
7. Rewrote the paragraph describing the relationship between our definition of
DELETE and the one in HTTP.  
8. Added example to 4.2.10 MOVE and Bindings
9. Edits throughout 4.2 so that semantics are described abstractly, independent
of any example.  Then examples are presented as needed.
10. Revised discussion of LOCK and bindings to make it clear that the URL
mapping used in the LOCK request is protected.
11. Moved some stuff from 4.1 Overview to the beginning of 4.2 Bindings and 4.3
Redirect References.  All that's left in 4.1 is stuff on the benefits and
limitations of bindings and redirect references.  So general information about
the semantics of bindings (independent of any particular method) now is at the
top of 4.2.  General information about the semantics of redirect references
(independent of any particular method) is now at the top of 4.3.
12. Moved backpointers to the end of 4.2 Bindings, since it will only apply to
bindings.  Revised to reflect that change.  Changed the property name from
DAV:references to DAV:bindings.  Revised the definition of DAV:bindings, added a
new XML element DAV:segment.
13. Passthrough: T is allowed on DELETE and MOVE requests for redirect
references.
14. Revised security considerations. 
15. Added 425 (Unordered Collection) status code
16. Added Failed ORDERPATCH example (5.5.4)
17. Added to 4.2.1 BIND: server MAY allow BIND to content negotiating resources
or to resources that dynamically generate content.
18. Added to general binding semantics:
� There's no difference between a binding created with BIND and any other
binding.
� Bindings are members of collections, and are not unique to advanced
collections.
� The identity of a binding (and hence its existence) is determined by the path
segment (in its collection) and the resource that it associates.
� Integrity of bindings MUST be guaranteed.
� Support for cross-server bindings is OPTIONAL.
19. Revised definition of the BIND method.
20. Server MUST fail BIND request if it can't guarantee integrity of the
resulting binding.
21. Added All-Bindings header for use with DELETE.
22. Servers MUST NOT reclaim system resources associated with a resource while
any bindings to that resource remain.
23. COPY with Depth: 0 on a collection MUST NOT duplicate the bindings contained
by the collection.
24. Combined the sections on "Other HTTP Operations on Redirect References" and
"Other WebDAV Operations on Redirect References" into a single section and
removed duplicate information.
25. Revised 4.3.10 "Redirect References to Collections" to give strictly
syntactic instructions for how to handle Request-URIs with embedded URIs of
redirect references.
26. Renamed DAV:reference to be DAV:redirectref so it will make more sense to
add a DAV:directref later if desired. 
27. Fixed some mistakes in 11 Capability Discovery.
28. Removed section on dependencies on other standards.

Comment:
  Terminology: Kept a definition of "reference," but revised it.  New
definition of binding, modified definition of redirect reference, deleted
definition of direct reference.

Introduction: Replace "references" with "shared resources".
Introduction: To support shared resources, a server must provide both bindings
and redirect references.

Replaced discussion of direct references with a discussion of bindings in 4.2
overview.

Delete everything related to direct references.  Ref-Type and DAV:reftype go
away, as do the direct and redirect XML elements. New Resource-Type header for
use with 302 responses to differentiate from plain HTTP redirects.
4.1: Add rationale for not defining direct references.
New sections 4.3 BIND method and 4.4 Semantics of bindings.
4.5 MKREF overwrites by default.
4.7 COPY for individual redirect references responds with 302, for references
encountered while copying a collection copies the reference.
4.9 New example of LOCK on a collection with Passthrough: T showing failure and
explaining what to do next.
No-Passthrough changed to Passthrough with values "T" and "F" throughout.
5.5.1 ORDERPATCH processing must be atomic

Claimed response code 506 for Loop Detected.

10 MUST support both bindings and redirect references in order to advertise
class "sharing" in responses to OPTIONS
Deleted Appendix 2 table summarizing direct / redirect semantics

Comment:
  Substantive Changes:
Changed 4.3 to allow an entity body in MKREF requests.
Changes to REQUIRE a Ref-Integrity header in MKREF requests, to define only the
value do-not-enforce, to require servers to fail any MKREF request with a value
of Ref-Integrity that it doesn't understand.
Changes to allow server-maintained orderings.
Added to OPTIONS: how to get the list of supported ref integrity policies, and
how to get the list of supported server-maintained orderings.  Added new XML
elements to support this: DAV:options, DAV:refintegrityoptions,
DAV:orderingoptions, DAV:do-not-enforce.
Did not make Jim Whitehead's requested changes related to Depth = 1 in Section
4.4, because it already states that Depth=1 is possible, and there is no
question of following references to collections into their target collections if
Depth=1 (Depth=infinity is the only relevant case).
Changed Example 4.4.1 so that there are no cross-server direct references.
Changed so that Ref-Type and Ref-Target are not returned with responses, except
for GET and HEAD with No-Passthrough, with 404 response to indicate that it's
the target that is not found, and Ref-Type with 302 responses.  Similarly for
DAV:reftype and DAV:reftarget in Multi-Status responses.
New section 4.16 on resolving relative URIs.  Moved explanations from 6.1
Ref-Target and 7.1 DAV:reftarget into the new section.
Changed the value of the Ordered header from Coded-url to absoluteURI.  Don't
see why it would need to be coded.
Changed value of Position header from Coded-url to Generic-Coded-url to allow
relative urls to be used.
Changed definition of Ref-Integrity to have DAV:do-not-enforce as the value
Changed definition of refintegrity: replaced ANY with #PCDATA
Changed definition of reftype to allow #PCDATA extension values

Editorial Changes:
Changes throughout to insure that normative language on any topic is located in
only one place, per Jim Whitehead's request of  3/15/99.
Removed Section 5.5.4 and put it in the rationale document.
Removed Alan Babich from authors.
Added to acknowledgements.
Fixed Jim Davis's address.
Editorial changes throughout per Jim Whitehead's notes of 3/15/99.

Comment:
  Revised for Internet Draft 03

Changed DAV:response to allow a prop element anywhere.  Location, reftarget, and
reftype will be inside prop when they are returned in Multi-Status responses.
Changed location from an element to a property to support this.
Moved summary of headers in responses to an appendix
Added appendix summarizing behavior of methods on each type of reference
Added rationale to DELETE / MOVE
Split COPY into a separate section with semantics as in 2/9 meeting
Changed GET / HEAD for redirect references to behave like all the other HTTP
methods.  Additional headers only get returned if No-Passthrough is present.
The location property MUST be an absolute URI.  The reftarget property and the
Ref-Target header MAY be relative URIs.  Added discussion of how to identify the
base URI.
Revised LOCK section: For redirect references, lock the reference; for direct
references, lock the target.  With ratonale.
Added COPY and LOCK examples.
Revised rules for when Ref-Target is required in responses, including the
rationale in the summary section.  (Sections 6.1 and 20.2)

Ref-Integrity header has only one defined value (DAV:do-not-enforce), and
extensions are allowed.
DAV:refintegrity property has only one defined value (DAV:weak), and extension
values are allowed.
Added paragraph on No-Passthrough and dangling references.
PROPFIND on a dangling reference gets 404.
PROPPATCH on a dangling references gets 404.
PROPFIND on a collection that contains a dangling references gets a 207 with a
404 for the dangling reference.
Ref-Target, Ref-Type, and Ref-Integrity cannot be used with MOVE or COPY.
New section on LOCK incorporating our decisions about its behavior for direct
references, for redirect references, for collections that contain direct
references, and for collections that contain redirect references -- with
rationale.

Comment:
  Revised based on design team call of 1/14/99:
Added location element to multistatus response syntax.
Let MKCOL and MKREF be redirected rather than having them fail.
Allow replacing a reference with an ordinary resource using PUT.
Let No-Passthrough be used with PROPFIND on a collection with Depth=infinity,
and describe semantics.
Change the definition of referential resource to say that it has no body, but
does 
have properties.
Change the values of Ref-Integrity to DAV:do-not-enforce and DAV:server-default
Change the values of the DAV:refintegrity property to DAV:weak and DAV:strong.
Change the definition of "weak reference" to  "server does not enforce
referential 
integrity".
Change the definition of "strong reference" to "server enforces referential 
integrity".
Revise section 3.8 to make it more clear and concise.

Comment:
  Intermediate revision 2.1 (not going to Internet Drafts) after IETF
Orlando.
1. Changed the definitions of direct / redirect in Section 1 Terminology and in
the Overview discussion in Section 3.2.  Less emphasis on whether ref or target
gets affected, more on whether client action is needed for resolution.
2. Align terminology with WebDAV spec:  collections contain URIs, not resources.
3. Remove Hide-Target.
4. Replace the Re-Direct header with the No-Passthrough header, which can be
applied both to direct and redirect references.
5.  Make all methods, both WebDAV and HTTP, respond with 302 for redirect
references.  (This raises new issues about Multistatus responses to PROPFIND and
other requests on collections that contain redirect references.)
6. Change to say that MKREF fails if a resource already exists at the
request-URI.
7. Remove Resource-Type.
8. Use the DAV header rather than a new DAV-Collections header with OPTIONS.
