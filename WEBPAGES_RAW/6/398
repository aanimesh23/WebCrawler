<h1>  Computational Complexity of Quantum Systems</h1>
<h2>
Sandy Irani, UC Irvine </h2>


<p>
One of the goals of quantum information theory is to understand quantum 
systems from the standpoint of computational complexity. How difficult 
is it to compute fundamental properties of a quantum system or simulate 
a particular system over time? A central idea in understanding these questions 
is quantum entanglement. On one hand, entanglement is a valuable resource that 
enables quantum computation and communication. On the other hand, the fact that 
some quantum systems have bounded entanglement accounts for the success of certain 
computational methods in finding ground states and simulating dynamics. I will 
give an overview of recent work in understanding the complexity of ground states 
of quantum systems both from the perspective of computational complexity and 
from the perspective of quantifying entanglement.
