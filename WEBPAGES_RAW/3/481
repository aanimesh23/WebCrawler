Title: 
Entanglement bound on the ground space of frustration-free qubit
systems
</h2>
<h2>
Authors: Sandra Irani and Jenny Lam
</h2>

<p>
Abstract: Entanglement is a crucial resource used in quantum
information and computation. We will present a brief introduction to
quantum computation, an overview of some of the research done in the
last decade to understand entanglement. Finally, we present a bound
on the entanglement of the ground space manifold of a class of
quantum many-body systems called frustration-free systems.
