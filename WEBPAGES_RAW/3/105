Abstract:
<p>
A supervised peer-to-peer system is a system in which
the overlay network is formed by a supervisor, but all other
activities can be performed on a peer-to-peer basis without
involving the supervisor. It can be seen as being between
server-based systems and pure peer-to-peer systems. The supervisor
only has to store a constant amount of information about the
system at any time and only needs to send a small constant number
of messages to integrate or remove a peer in a constant amount of
time. Therefore it shares the benefits of server-based and pure
peer-to-peer systems without inheriting their disadvantages.
