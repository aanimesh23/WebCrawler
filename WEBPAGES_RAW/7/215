<H2>Look-and-Feel menu</H2>

<p>The Look-and-Feel menu allows the user to change the nature of the Chimera Server's user-interface.  There are three different Look-and-Feels to choose from: Metal, CDE/Motif, and Windows.</p>

<p>While the Look-and-Feel of the display can vary depending on the current selection of this menu, the functionality of the Chimera Server remains the same. Menus and Tabs exist in all three Look-and-Feels, and they all behave according to the documentation.</p>

<H3>Look-and-Feels</H3>

<H4>Metal</H4>

<p>The user-interface is presented in the Metal look-and-feel:</p>

<H4>CDE/Motif</H4>

<p>The user-interface is presented in the CDE/Motif look-and-feel:</p>

<p>Note: The Tabs in this look-and-feel may be stacked such that some of the labels are partially obscured.</p>

<H4>Windows</H4>

<p>The Windows look-and-feel can only be used on Windows-based machines. A screen shot of this look-and-feel is forthcoming.</p>

<p>If the Windows selection is made on a non-Windows-based platform, an error message will appear. This restriction may be lifted in the future. Contact Microsoft's lawyers for more information!</p>
