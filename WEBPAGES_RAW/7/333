Introduction</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No doubt you have encountered linear
equations many times during your careers as students.&nbsp; Most
likely, the very first equation you had to solve was linear.&nbsp; Yet
despite their simplicity, systems of linear equations are of immense
importance in mathematics and its applications to areas of physical
sciences, economics, engineering and many many more.&nbsp; One of the
purposes of linear algebra is to undertake a systematic study of linear
equations.&nbsp; In this lab, we will use MATLAB to solve systems of
linear equations.&nbsp; We will also learn about a very useful
application of systems of linear equations to economics and computer
science. </p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">2.2 </font>
<font size="4">Systems of Linear Equations</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By now we have seen how a system of linear
equations can be transformed into a matrix equation, making the system
easier to solve.&nbsp; For example, the system
</p>
 <p>
 <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2x_1 - x_2 + x_3 = 8"
  />
 </p>
 <p>
  <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_1 + 2 x_2 + 3 x_3 = 9"
   />
 </p>
 <p>
  <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?3x_1 - x_3 = 3"
   />
 </p>

<p>can be written the following way:</p>

<p><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 200px; height: 100px;" alt=""
 src="Lab2Images/image006.gif"> </p>
<p>Now, by augmenting the matrix with the vector on the right and using
row operations, this equation can easily be solved by hand.&nbsp;
However, if our system did not have nice integer entries, solving the
system by hand using row reduction could become very difficult.&nbsp;
MATLAB provides us with an easier way to get an answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A system of this type has the form <b>A<i>x</i></b>
= <i> <b>b</b></i>, so we can enter these numbers into MATLAB using
the following commands:</p>
<p><tt>&gt;&gt; <font color="#990000">A = [2 -1 1; 1 2 3; 3 0 -1]</font></tt></p>
<p><tt>&gt;&gt; <font color="#990000">b = [8; 9; 3]</font></tt></p>
<p>(Notice that for the column vector <i> <b>b</b></i>, we include
semicolons after each entry to ensure that the entries are on different
rows; the command</p>
<p>&nbsp;<tt>&gt;&gt; <font color="#990000">b = [8 9 3]</font></tt> </p>
<p>would produce a row vector, which is not the same thing.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The command</p>
<p><tt>&gt;&gt; <font color="#990000">x = A\b</font></tt></p>
<p>will find the solution (if it exists) to our equation <b>A<i>x</i></b>
= <i> <b>b</b></i>.&nbsp; In this case, MATLAB tells us</p>
<p><tt>x =</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.0000<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -1.0000<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.0000</tt></p>
<p><font color="#ff6600"><b>Remark 2.1</b></font>&nbsp; Please take
care in entering "A\b" command. It has a backslash "\" and NOT a
forward slash&nbsp; "/".</p>

<p><font color="#ff6600"><b>Remark 2.2</b></font>&nbsp; The discrepancy
in part (c) of the above exercise is simply due to rounding
error.&nbsp; You'll notice that the error is a vector multiplied by a
very small number, one on the order of 10<sup>-15</sup>.&nbsp; But why
is there any error at all?&nbsp; After all, solving by row reduction
gave very nice numbers, right?&nbsp; The reason lies in the way MATLAB
stores numbers.&nbsp; In this calculation MATLAB represents numbers in
"floating point form", which means it represents them in scientifc
notation to 10^(-14) accuracy.&nbsp; Thus when you see 10^(-14) printed
in calculations, it is equivalent to zero.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a drawback, however, to solving systems
of equations using the command "x = C\d".&nbsp; Let us explore that
further.</p>
<table id="AutoNumber1" width="100%" border="2" cellpadding="2">

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To deal with the case of
inconsistent systems or systems with infinitely many solutions, it may
sometimes be better to use MATLAB to simply row-reduce your matrix and
then read off the solutions.&nbsp; We happen to be very lucky since
MATLAB has a command that performs Gaussian elimination for you.<br>
</p>
<p align="left">Consider the following homogeneous system of equations:
</p>
<p> <i>6x<sub>1</sub> +&nbsp; 2x<sub>2</sub> + 3x<sub>3</sub><sub></sub>
= 0<br>
4x<sub>1</sub> +&nbsp; x<sub>2</sub> - 2x<sub>3</sub> = 0<br>
2x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub> + 5x<sub>3</sub> = 0<br>
</i></p>
<p>Enter the corresponding matrix <b>C</b> and the column vector <b><i>d</i>
</b>into MATLAB. Now we want to perform row
reduction on the augmented matrix [<b>C</b> | <i> <b>d</b></i>].&nbsp;
The
command
that
performs
row
reduction in MATLAB is called "rref" (it
stands for "reduced row echelon form").&nbsp; Then type in<br>
</p>
<p><tt>&gt;&gt; <font color="#990000">rref([C d])<br>
</font></tt></p>
<p><tt><font color="#990000">ans =<br>

Recall from class that we can then use the row reduced form to get that
<i><br>
<br>
x<sub>1</sub></i> = 3.5<i>x<sub>3</sub></i> <br>
<i>x<sub>2</sub></i> =-12<i>x<sub>3</sub></i><br>
<br>
<i>x<sub>3</sub></i> here is the free variable, and it can be choosen
to be any value.&nbsp; Once chosen, the two equations above determine
the values of <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>.&nbsp;
For instance, if we choose&nbsp; <i>x<sub>3 </sub></i>= 2, then <i>x<sub>1
</sub></i>= 7 and <i>x<sub>2 </sub></i>= -24.&nbsp; In this way we can
write down all the solutions (of which there are infinitely many) to
the system above.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next we turn to some applications of linear algebra,
which will involve word problems.&nbsp; Often in a linear algebra
course such problems are assigned from the textbook and are to be done
using pencil and paper.&nbsp; This can be quite tedious.&nbsp;
Hopefully with your burgeoning MATLAB expertise you will be able to see
that the mathematical models we will explore in this course work even
for systems with hundreds of variables.<br>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">2.3 An
Application to Economics: Leontief Models</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Leontief">Wassily Leontief</a>
(1906-1999) was a Russian-born, American economist who, aside from
developing highly sophisticated economic theories, also enjoyed trout
fishing, ballet and fine wines.&nbsp; He won the 1973 Nobel Prize in
economics for his work in creating mathematical models to describe
various economic phenomena.&nbsp; In the remainder of this lab we will
look at a very simple special case of his work called a closed exchange
model.&nbsp; Here is the premise:</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose in a far away land of
Eigenbazistan, in a small country town called Matrixville, there lived
a Farmer, a Tailor, a Carpenter, a Coal Miner and Slacker Bob.&nbsp;
The Farmer produced food; the Tailor, clothes; the Carpenter, housing;
the Coal Miner supplied energy; and Slacker Bob made High Quality 100
Proof Moonshine, half of which he drank himself.&nbsp; Let us make the
following assumptions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Everyone buys from and sells to the central pool
(i.e. there is no outside supply and demand)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Everything produced is consumed</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">For these reasons this is called a <i>closed</i>
exchange model.&nbsp; Next we must specify what fraction of each of the
goods is consumed by each person in our town. Here is a table
containing this information:</p>
<table id="AutoNumber2" width="72%" border="1">

of the corresponding goods.&nbsp; So for example, <i>p<sub>F </sub></i>is
the
Farmer's

as the cost of all the food.&nbsp; So if
the Farmer produces $100 worth of food, then his income will also be
$100 since all of this food is bought out and the profits go to the

How Google Works </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The beginning of this story is actually a theorem
of Perron-Frobenius
from the early 20th century, but we will discuss this later in our
tale.
Instead we start with a cute word problem illustrating
the theorem,
which has amused linear algebra students
at least as far back as the 1970's. The problem is: In a particular
group of people,
who is the most popular?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One possible approach is to ask everyone in the
group
to list their friends in that group.
Say there are 4 people, named Jane, Charlie, Mary and Fred,
who we affectionately nickname J, C, M and F.
The friends list is:
</p>
<p align="center"> Jane lists C and M<br>
Charlie lists J, M and F<br>
Mary lists J, C and F<br>
Fred lists J and M
</p>
<p>(This experiment is dangerous. You should
not try it in your own dormitory.)
Our data naturally amounts to a 4x4 matrix of 0's and 1's:
</p>
<p align="center">
<img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 300px; height: 250px;" alt=""
 src="Lab2Images/img6.gif" align="middle">
</p>
<p>Some people tend to list every one they ever met
and others only list closest friends,
so to compensate for this we normalize the matrix by dividing each list
by the number of people in it:
</p>
<p align="center">
<img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 139px; height: 182px;" alt=""
 src="Lab2Images/img7.gif"></p>
<p>We shall call this the <b> linking matrix </b> and
denote it by <i> L</i>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we have collected data, we wish to
determine
a nonnegative number associated to each person called their
<b>popularity</b>;
combined they give the <b>popularity vector</b>
<img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 81px; height: 144px;" alt=""
 src="Lab2Images/img9.gif" align="middle">for the group. Its basic
property is
</p>
<p align="center"><i>A person's popularity is the weighted sum of the
popularity of people who reference that person.</i>
</p>
<p>We see what the weights are and what this means by the example,
</p>
<p align="center">
 <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r_{Jane}=\frac{1}{3}r_{Charlie}
 + \frac{1}{3}r_{Mary}+\frac{1}{2}r_{Fred}"
  />
 </p>
<p>which seems reasonable when one considers that Charlie's
contribution
to Jane's popularity is (1/3)r<sub>Charlie</sub>, because Jane constitutes
one third of Charlie's friends and r<sub>Charlie</sub> is Charlie's popularity. In
matrix vector form these equations are exactly
</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
L<b>r</b> = <b>r</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Equation A.1)</p>
<p>which is the same as</p>
<p align="center">(L - I)<b>r</b> = 0</p>
<p>where <i>I</i> is the 4x4 identity matrix. Solving this equation we
can
determine the relative
"popularity" of Jane, Charlie, Mary an Fred.
We ran MATLAB using the <font color="#990000">rref</font> command as
in exercise 2.6 and set (arbitrarily, of course) <b>r<sub>F</sub></b>
= 1 to get <b>r<sub>J</sub></b> = 1.5, <b>r<sub>C</sub></b>
= 1.3125, <b>r<sub>M</sub></b> = 1.6875, and <b>r<sub>F</sub></b> =
1. Thus the order of popularity, from highest to lowest, is: Mary,
Jane, Charlie, and finally, Fred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some graduate students at Stanford got the idea
that this
sort of method could be used to rank a group of web pages. You type in
some key words (which we will denote by the set <i>K</i>) and the
software identifies vast numbers of
webpages <i>W<sub>K</sub></i> (most of which are garbage as far as you
are concerned) containing the words in <i>K.</i>&nbsp;
The
big
challenge
is automatically finding a few good (popular) webpages.
What the Google founders did was have the software look at each webpage
<i>w</i> in <i>W<sub>K</sub></i> and determine which other web
pages in <i>W<sub>K</sub></i> the page <i>w</i> links to, thus
associating to each webpage <i>w</i> a vector <i>L<sub>w</sub></i> of
0's and 1's, just as we did above with the list of students.
Next, it builds a matrix <i>L</i> whose columns are the normalized
vectors <i>L<sub>w</sub></i> and proceeds just as we did in the
popularity problem. Google computes <i>r</i> very quickly and lists
for you, the user, the web pages in order of high to low popularity.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sounds like a good plan, but if you are going to
base a company
on this and put up lots of money to back it,
there are few things you would definitely want to know:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Does the equation&nbsp;
L<b>r</b> = <b>r</b> above always have a solution
(what do you know from the course so far makes you think
it seldom will?)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Will a solution have entries that are
nonnegative?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Is the solution unique? If not, we will have
conflicting rankings.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the founders of Google knew
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Theorem (Perron-Frobenious)</b>
For any matrix <i>L</i> having all entries nonnegative
and each column summing to 1, the equation <i>L<b>r</b> = <b>r</b></i>
has a nonnegative solution <b><i>r</i></b>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the Perron-Frobenius theorem tells us that
there always is a solution to the popularity problem. While we do not
go into it, the theory also tells us that uniqueness is usually true,
and explains the circumstances when it is not.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the late 1990s the leading internet portal was
Yahoo, which employed warehouses full of people to look at web pages
and grade them. By using this simple math model (with a few bells and
whistles added) Google quickly displaced Yahoo. The ranking you just
saw is often called the Page Rank after Larry Page, a founder of
Google, who is in a few years became one of the 10 richest Americans.
All of this is indeed a core example at the heart of a rapidly growing
area of analysis of networks.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several morals to draw.
Theorems are efficient ways to remember key ideas.
What a mathematician calls a proof may well translate to
industry as quality control. Lastly,
if you learn linear algebra well, then you will probably get rich.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it's time for a little practice with the
PageRank algorithm. Suppose that we have five websites, namely the
sites of your good friends Alan, Beth, Charlie, Dana, and Eleanor,
which
we'll simply refer to as A, B, C, D, and E. Let's also suppose that the
links between the various sites are given by the graph below:
</p>
<p align="center">
<img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 500px; height: 500px;" alt=""
 src="Lab2Images/GoogleGraph.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arrow pointing from C to D means that
Charlie's site links to Dana's, etc. For small collections of objects,
graphs like this are an effective means of showing the links between
sites.

links to which just as we did in the popularity example. Remember to
normalize, and be sure that your input is exact (for example, make sure
you enter 1/3 instead of .333 - this is important for part b, since our
columns must sum to 1). Include all input and output from Matlab. <br>

"Empty matrix: 5-by-0", be sure to double check your answer to part a!).<br>

PageRank? Explain your answer, especially
in light of any negative numbers which may have arisen in part (b).
List the remaining websites in order of decreasing PageRank. </td>
    </tr>

<br>
In practice <i> L</i> is often huge.
So a question to mull over is how can we solve <i> Lr =r</i> for
problems
of huge size? Working in our favor is the fact that that most entries
of <i>L</i> are 0.&nbsp; Such an <i>L</i> is called a sparse matrix,
and a major
branch of mathematics research is exploiting this to
find a solution. What do we do?
A hint: Gaussian Elimination (row reduction) will not work.
Later in these assignments we shall get a glimpse of
something that does.

2.5 Conclusion</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Systems
of linear equations, though quite uncomplicated theoretically, show up
in many interesting applications.&nbsp; Leontief's closed exchange
model and Google's Page Rank algorithm are only two of many such
applications.&nbsp; Because systems of
linear equations that arise in applications tend to be quite big and
messy and not suitable to working with by hand, computer programs, such
as MATLAB, turn out to be an indispensable tool for people who must
work with such systems in their work.</font></p>
