<H1>Making donations to the UCI Machine Learning Repository</H1>

We're always looking for additional databases.  Donations 
may be made by doing an 
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLAnonymous.html">
anonymous ftp</A> of donated files to the <B>/incoming</B> directory 
at <B>ftp.ics.uci.edu</B>.  After ftping your files, please send email 
to <B>ml-repository@ics.uci.edu</B>.<P>

While we accept entries with minimal documentation.  We prefer that
the donor do their best at documenting the files.  The file 
<A HREF = "ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/machine-learning-databases/DOC-REQUIREMENTS">DOC-REQUIREMENTS</A>
describes the standard documentation format.<P>

We also prefer that the data have a standard format.  For databases of
instances: one instance per line, no spaces, commas separate attribute
values, and missing values denoted by "?" is the standard form.  For
other types of data, use your best judgment.

<H2>Thanks for you donations! You are helping to make machine
learning a strong and vital research area.</H2>
