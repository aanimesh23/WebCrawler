<P>Logic Assignment:</P>

<P><BR>
Translate the following into first order logic, then into clausal form<BR>
<BR>
1. All birds have feathers.<BR>
a)<BR>
b)<BR>
2. Squigs have feathers<BR>
a)<BR>
b)<BR>
3. What do you get from resolving 1b with 2b.<BR>
         <BR>
<BR>
4. Put BOTH these well-formed formulas (wffs) into clausal form: (Both means treat them as a pair of axioms about
the world).<BR>
<BR>
a) for all x, y [ On(x,y) implies Above(x,y)]   (1)<BR>
b) for all x, y, z [ Above(x,y) &amp; Above(y,z) implies Above(x,z)]  (2)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
5. Using the clause in 4 plus the statements:<BR>
                    On(B,A)  (3)<BR>
                    On(A,Table)  (4)<BR>
      Prove (by refutation resolution) that Above(B,Table).<BR>
      Remember a refutation proof starts with the negation of the predicated to be proven, i.e. not Above(B,Table)
 (5)<BR>
<BR>
    I have numbered each of the clauses so that you explain each step in the proof by saying: resolving clause
#n with clause #m.  Number new clauses in your own proof.<BR>
<BR>
  To start you off:<BR>
<BR>
     Not Above(B,y) or not Above(y,Table)  #6  by resolving  #2 and #5.<BR>
<BR>
There are several steps in the proof and you may need to search a while.<BR>
