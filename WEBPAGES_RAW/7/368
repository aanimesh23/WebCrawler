Placeless Documents: A Document Management System that Works

Traditional document storage systems -- including the file systems
that most of us use -- are organized based on the needs of the system
rather than the requirements of real world practice. They rely on
long-lived hierarchies and impose artificial barriers between documents
from different sources (files, the web, email, and so forth). The
Placeless Documents Project is exploring ways to address these problems.
The key notion in Placeless is that "properties" -- structured metadata
on documents -- can be used to reflect multiple, overlapping work
practices and can support flexible, dynamic organization and use
of documents. In this talk, I'll describe the motivations and design
of the Placeless Documents system, and discuss some of our experiences.

A long-standing problem in the development of groupware is the design
and implementation of systems that support the subtleties of social
interaction. This work explores the problem of finding "expertise" in
an organization. An in-depth field study of expertise location in a
medium sized software development company demonstrated that expertise
is fundamentally a collaborative activity. People employ several
different cognitive and social evaluations when identifying and
selecting other individuals to pursue for expertise. The results from
the field study were then used to inform the design of a system. I
present an expertise recommender system that employs heuristics and
information sources similar to those used by the field study
participants.
