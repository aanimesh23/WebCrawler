<h1>Cryptogram Helper Algorithm</h1>

<hr>
</div>

<p>The algorithm used by the applet's "Solve" button is a
deterministic, iterative procedure based around a 26x26 matrix of
probabilities (how likely the algorithm thinks it is that a given
code letter should be replaced by a given text letter). The matrix
starts out with all probabilities equal, then (after loading <a
href="freqc.txt.gz">a dictionary of English word frequencies</a>)
repeats the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>For each word in the dictionary that matches a word of the
cryptogram, the word's frequency is multiplied by the matrix
entries for its individual letters, giving an overall probability
of seeing that word in that position.</li>

<li>For each pair of a code word and a possible decryption of that
word, we build a 26x26 matrix in which the probability of finding
that word is as large as possible (with uniform probabilities for
unrelated letters). We then replace our original matrix with a new
matrix formed as a weighted average of the word matrices, where the
weights are the word probabilities computed in the first step.</li>

<li>A minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm computes the most
likely decryption for the current matrix.</li>

<li>We try all possible ways of swapping two letters in the
decryption, keeping a swap when it improves the quality (number of
recognized words and product of frequencies of those words). If we
find a good swap we also adjust the matrix to make that decryption
more likely in future iterations.</li>

<li>For each word of the decryption, we use the dictionary to find
all other words that could replace it without changing anything in
the rest of the decryption. If we find any such words, we use the
one with the highest frequency.</li>
</ol>

<p>At each iteration, the iteration number and quality of the current
translation are shown in the browser's status line. The decryption
shown in the main window is the best one found so far, which is not
necessarily the one from the latest iteration.</p>
