<H1>UCI <A HREF="../">ICS 1C</A>, Homework 4</H1>
<B>21 August - 9 September 1996</B><br>
<p>

The final two weeks of the session, most of your lab work will focus
on the creation of a Web-based hypertext "research paper" on some
academic/scholarly topic which you pick (subject to acceptance
by the instructor).  The topic can be related to another course
you are taking, your major, or the content of this class.
An annotated guide to Web resources in an academic/scholarly area
is one type of reasonable research paper.
<P>
Here's the overall time-line:
<ul>
<li>
  21 &amp; 26 August: Consider what topic you want to choose and get at
     least 5 distinct sites from which you can get suitable information.
     Prepare a proposal consisting of 50 to 100 words describing the
     scope of your paper and 5 of the references you will use.  Check
     with Cahill and Leung if you have questions
     about the appropriateness of a topic or want suggestions.
<li>
  26 August: In lab, submit your proposal using the Web form
       <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~vitus/ics1c/doc/hw4a.html">
       http://www.ics.uci.edu/~vitus/ics1c/doc/hw4a.html</A>
     which will be available at that time.
     <BR>Suggestion: Use a text editor to create
     your proposal and then cut-and-paste into the form provided.
<li>
  27 - 29 August: Proposals on display so that the instructional staff
     and members of the class 
     can offer comments and propose questions for you to address.
<li>
  9 September: Final project due by 5 p.m.
</ul>
Team/joint papers are acceptable with 2 to 3 people collaborating.
All participants and their roles should be identified in the proposal.
<p>
Grading will be on the basis of content and presentation
(including appropriate use of the technology).
The choice of topic is a critical part of this project.
<p>
The characterization of it as "academic/scholarly" is deliberate.
Techo-toy gee-whiz stuff is fun, but not what is expected here.
<p>
In choosing your topic and writing the proposal (one could almost call
it an abstract written before the paper), imagine that the audience
will be a faculty member, parent, or fellow student who is skeptical
that all this "network computer stuff" has substantive content beyond 
number-crunching, network-cruising, chat-line, game playing.
