<h1>Process analysis</h1>
</center>

<ul>
<li>Examine organizational landscape and identify relevant issues and challenges
<li>Use knowledge-based tools/techniques for analysis
<li>Collectively select strategy for GM process redesign
	<ul>
	<li>ONR participation was essential and successful
	<li>Critical to identifying missing or overlooked GM steps
	(e.g., Make_Grant_Folder is first step of AS-IS Validate_PR_Package).
	<li>Opportunities for process streamlining have been identified
	by ONR participants.

<h1>Process redesign</h1>
</center>

<ul>
<li>Articulate redesign approach
	<ul>
	<li>Model, analyze, diagnose (measure), identify relevant redesign 
	hueristics, prioritize redesign alternatives, prototype and 
	demonstrate, transition
	</ul>
<li>Identify high leverage opportunity areas, expected outcomes, potential
	problems
	<ul>
	<li>Follows below
	</ul>
<li>Constrain redesign alternatives according to:
	<ul>
	<li>Do not increase any person's workload
	<li>Do not create new staff positions
	<li>Seek changes that are "self-motivating" or that enable
	organizational incentives.
	</ul>
<li>Model, visualize, and prototype new process alternatives

<h1>ONR Grants Management Process Transitions</h1>

<b>Overall Suggestions for Pre-Award and Grant Award</b>
<ul>
<li>Consult with O3 to (a) identify and capture any Pre-Award
	improvements they can provide. For example, can they characterize
	types or groups of pre-approved, never-approved, insufficient-funds
	proposals? Automated award notice distribution? Input from O8
	for not-approved proposals? Clarify responsibilities for
	who will verify or validate proposal funding and budget information?
<li>Develop strategy and plan for realizing "full" TO-BE vision.
	Initial version due 24 September 96.
<li>Need resolution and convergence of <em>electronic proposal</em>
	definition, design, implementation, and integration.
</ul>
<p>
<b><em>Pre-Award</em></b>
<ul>
<li><em>Evaluate_Proposal</em> <b>(1a)</b>: Update ONR Proposal Submission
	Guidelines on ONR WWW pages to solicit more complete proposal
	information (e.g., Identify BAA #, Certifications, Submittals).
	Consult Code 254 (Terry Young), ONR Webmaster (Code 92).
<li><em>Evaluate_Proposal</em> <b>(1b)</b>: Send Letter to Offeror (University
	Business Office) requesting additional or missing proposal 
	information; Mail returned to designated GS. 
<li><em>Approve_PR</em> <b>(1c)</b>: Determine when O3 can use daily releases
	or IF actions. (Consult O3)
<li><em>Approve_PR</em> <b>(3)</b>: Automate PR Assignment to GS. Assignments
	to occur before proposal arrival. Deletes later (AS-IS) process
	step for manual Assigning PR to GS. Consult Code 21, 24, 25, 92.
<li><em>Approve_PR</em> <b>(2)</b>: Automate "Proposal_Received" Notice
	in Code 25. Consult Tricia.
<li><em>Assemble_PR_Package</em> <b>(1d)</b>: Eliminate Hard Copy PRs.
	This <em>deletes</em> AS-IS steps for Print, Sort, Compare,
	and Carry Hard Copy Proposals.  
<li><em>O2 Handle_Approved_Proposal</em> <b>(3)</b>:
	Delete manual Assignment of PR to GS. Activity done earlier with
	automated support.
<li><em>Validate_PR_Package</em> <b>(1e)</b>: Delete Validate Hard Copy with 
	PR. Discuss and clarify validation and verification responsibilities 
	with O3 (already noted). Rename Verify_CAGE_SCCC_Codes to	
	Verify/Obtain_Codes.
<li><em>Obtain_Missing_Information</em> <b>(1e)</b>: Delete FAX_Request
	Missing Information, unless 1a and 1b fail.	
	Also, rename to Update_Missing_Data_Received.
</ul>
<p>
<b><em>Grant_Award</em></b>
<ul>
<li><em>Print_Sign_Document</em> <b>(2)</b>: Add Obligate Grant Data in STARS. 	
<li><em>Prepare_Deliver_Package_to_FM</em> <b>(2)</b>: Delete AS-IS steps for:
	Copy Cover Page, Copy FAD, Copy Signatures, Place on Pending Review
	Shelf, Log Data Sent to FM in INRIS, and Deliever Package to FM.
	Consult Codes 08, 21, 25, 92. 
<li><em>Prepare_Deliver_Package_to_FM</em> <b>(2)</b>: Delete
	Obligate Data in STARS  (moved up earlier in process).
<li><em>Distribution</em> <b>(2)</b>: Delete Pickup Document, Log Date
	Returned, Match File. 
<li><em>Distribution</em> <b>(4)</b>: Automate 100% Distribution 
	(by 31 March 97). This depends on availability of adequate
	ADP information infrastructure. Consult Codes 08, 24, 25, 92, DFAS,
	and selected Universities for pilot tests.
<li><em>Distribution</em> <b>(4)</b>: Need approval to forego File
	Hard Copy Documents. Consult Codes 08, 25, and OOCC.
</ul>

<b>Overall suggestions for improvements 
in <em>Grant Adminstration</em> and <em>Close-Out</em> Processes</b>
<ul>
<li>All improvements to Grant Administration and Close-Out are
priority "4" items, requiring more than 90 days to complete.
<li>ONR Field Operations  perform Grant/Contract Administration and
Grant/Contract Close-Out for ONR and other government agencies (e.g.,
Darpa, NASA), However, we only address improvements in ONR Grant
Administration and Close-Out at this time. Handling Contracts and
non-ONR grants is likely to benefit from the same kinds of improvements
identified here, but getting them implementing is a major challenge.
<li>Improvements in Grant Administration Functions were not specified
at this time, since these activities are demand-driven. Capturing these
processes requires further effort.
Nonetheless, the provision of an electronic
proposal and grant document folder was expected to help streamline
the efficiency and effectiveness of these ongoing
grant administration functions.
<li>Three transitions or transition events are needed to redesign
nearly all of Grant Administration and Close-Out. These are
       <ul>
       <li><b>4a:</b><em>
       Provision of Electronic Grants Packages using INRIS</em>. Scheduled
       for delivery by February 1997. This eliminates all tasks and
       actions involved in Grant Administration that receive, sort,
       distribute, and resolve problems with grants, except for the
       remaining need to handle new contractors, as they occur.
       <li><b>4b:</b><em>
       Integration of CAMIS and INRIS</em>. Scheduled for completion
       by March 1997. This streamlines away all tasks and actions that
       involve the manual transfer and re-entry of information between
       INRIS and CAMIS.
       <li><b>4c:</b><em>
       Provision of an Electronic Proposal and Grants Documents Folder</em>.
       Not yet scheduled. This represents a new technical capability
       that could be prototyped using USC's Distributed Hypertext (DHT)
       information infrastructure that could integrate INRIS, CAMIS,
       and other information systems together over a <em>Grants Management
       Intranet</em> for ONR.
       </ul>

<li>Develop strategy and plan for realizing "full" TO-BE vision.
      <ul>
	<li>Need resolution and convergence of <em>electronic proposal
	and grant folder</em>
	definition, design, implementation, and integration.

<h1>Proposed redesign of ONR GM Processes</h1>

		Postscript diagram</a>, 
		<a href=To-be-pre-award.html>
		HTML</a> listing, or

		Postscript diagram</a>, 
		<a href=To-be-admin.html>

		Process dictionary</a> format.

	<li>Close-Out:

		Postscript diagram</a>, 
		<a href=To-be-close-out.html>
		HTML</a> listing, or

		Process dictionary</a> format.

	</ul>
		designed and presented as process decomposition diagrams.
<li>Note, in Grant-Award, if legal requirement for archiving
Hard-Copy documents can be waived or removed, then Grant-Award
process collapses to <em>three</em> steps (in contrast to 24 steps
in AS-IS version)! Similarly, in Grant Administration, adoption of
improvements with INRIS and its integration with CAMIS, Administration
Preparation is streamlined from 21 steps in the AS-IS to 1 step in the
TO-BE version!
