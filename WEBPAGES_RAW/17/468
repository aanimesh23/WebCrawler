<div class=title>Iterative Algorithms for Graphical Models</div>

<div class=abstract>
<b>Abstract</b><BR> Probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks, and even
reasoning within error bounds are known to be NP-hard problems. Our research
focuses on investigating approximate message-passing algorithms inspired by
Pearlï¿½s belief propagation algorithm and by variable elimination. We study
the advantages of bounded inference provided by anytime schemes such as
Mini-Clustering (MC), and combine them with the virtues of iterative
algorithms such as Iterative Belief Propagation (IBP). Our resulting hybrid
algorithm Iterative Join-Graph Propagation (IJGP) is shown empirically to
surpass the performance of both MC and IBP on several classes of
networks. IJGP can also be viewed as a Generalized Belief Propagation
algorithm, a framework which recently allowed connections with approximate
algorithms from statistical physics, showing that convergence points are in
fact stationary points of the Bethe (or the more general Kikuchi) free
energy. Although there is still little understanding why or when IBP works
well, it exhibits tremendous performance on different classes of problems,
most notably coding and satisfiability problems.  We investigate the
iterative algorithms for Bayesian networks by making connections with well
known constraint processing algorithms, which help explain when IBP infers
correctly extreme beliefs. This study gives an account of why iterating
helps, and identifies classes of easy and hard problems for IBP (and
IJGP). Finally, we plan to investigate iterative message-passing algorithms
in other graph-based frameworks such as influence diagrams and planning.
