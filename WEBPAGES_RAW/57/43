Drawing Planar Graphs on a Curve<br>
E. Di Giacomo, W. Didimo, G. Liotta, and S.K. Wismath<br>
Speaker: Jeremy Yu Meng
</h2>

This paper introduces and studies the concept of a curve
embedding of a planar graph. Let <I>C</I> be the family of 2D curves described
by concave functions and let <I>G</I> be a planar graph. A curve embedding
of <I>G</I> is a linear ordering of the vertices of <I>G</I> such that there exists a
crossing-free 2D drawing of <I>G</I> where the vertices are constrained to be
on any given curve of <I>C</I> and the edges are drawn as polylines with at
most one bend. We prove that every planar graph has a curve embedding
which can be computed in linear time. Further we present applications
of the concept of curve embedding to upward drawings and point-set
constrained drawings.
