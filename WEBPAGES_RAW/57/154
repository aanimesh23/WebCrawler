</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This invited workshop aims to bring together researchers and designers from academia and industry to discuss directions in the development of high-performance, parallel, distributed, and multimedia processors and systems. The workshop invitees are computer architects and compiler, operating system, and application experts. The main goal of the workshop is to discuss future trends in the development of architecture and software systems and to explore the assumptions made by the architects about software systems and by software writers about architecture. The increased complexity in each of these areas calls for increased interaction with researchers from all of the other disciplines to accurately assess the potential directions and future trends in architecture and systems. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main themes of the workshop are software- and technology-driven and constrained new architectures, compiler/architecture interaction and co-design, and application requirements and characteristics. Both numerical and non-numerical applications, such as database, data mining, Web- and Java-based, and (high-performance) embedded applications, are of interest. In all cases a longer-term view and assessment of the future is of most interest. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>This year's special focus is on multi-core systems and 
ways to explore single-program parallelism on such systems. </b>
All aspects of design, compilation, and application
design are of interest for both single-chip multi-core processors and multi-processor systems built from such chips 
and are the 2008 special topics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  Other topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:
 </P>

<UL>
<LI> All aspects of processor design </LI>
<LI>Multi-threaded processors </li>
<li> Large-scale multiprocessors </LI>
<LI>Memory technology and memory hierarchy organization </LI>
<LI>Applications and their performance </LI>
<LI>Power management</LI>
<LI>Embedded system design</LI>
</UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The workshop will consist of sessions combining individual presentations with discussion. Presentations will be limited to ~20 min to provide sufficient time for discussion. An ideal presentation will concentrate on trends and future directions in addition to recently obtained results. Speculation is encouraged. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Workshop participation is capped at 25 invitees. </P>
</B><H3><A NAME="publ"></A></H3>
<B><P>Submission and Publication </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The invitees wishing to make a presentation should submit an extended abstract, up to 3
pages, by 1/14/07. Submissions should be electronic in pdf format. The abstracts will be reviewed and printed in the on-site proceedigns. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final proceedings consisting of full papers will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press after the meeting. The papers will undergo an additional review process and will be selected for publication in the post-proceedings. Papers will be due by July 1st 2008. <BR>
Publication instructions will be distributed by CS Press at a later date. </P>

<li>
There are non-stop flights from the mainland to the Kona airport (KOA), in particular 
from LA and San Francisco. The hotel is about an hour's drive from the airport in the town of Hilo.
   <br>
<li>
Registration fee: US$290.00.
<br>
<li><b> 
Reservations can be made through the hotel website above (an oceanview rooms are recommended).
<li>
The hotel is not near the airport and there is no shuttle service, althought a taxi can get you there..
