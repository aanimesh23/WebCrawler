<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>Summary:</B> This assignment will give
you practice with some basic probability concepts.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Feel free to discuss these problems with others,

<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(a)</B>  Every day you download some investment
information from a web site whose server&#39;s load varies on different
days of the week.  On Monday through Thursday, the download takes you 15
minutes.  On Friday, it takes you 25 minutes.  On Saturday and Sunday, it
takes you 10 minutes.  What is your overall expected download time (i.e.,
imagine you don&#39;t know what day it is)?</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b)</B>  A standard slot machine has three
wheels, each with 20 symbols distributed as shown below.  When the arm is
pulled, each of the 20 symbols on each wheel is equally likely to come up.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c)  </B>In the California Lottery game
SuperLotto, a player would pay $1.00 to pick six numbers (between 1 and
51) for the next draw.  (We&#39;re describing the original SuperLotto game,
not the current SuperLotto Plus with a separate &quot;Mega&quot; number;
the probabilities for SuperLotto Plus are a little more complicated.)  Every
Wednesday and Saturday, the Lottery draws six numbers.  If the player&#39;s
six numbers match the Lottery&#39;s six numbers, the player wins the multi-million-dollar
jackpot (or splits it with any other players who also picked the same six
winning numbers).  If nobody matches the six winning numbers, the jackpot
&quot;rolls over&quot; to the next draw; that is, the jackpot amount for
the draw with no winners is added to the jackpot for the next draw.  If
many draws go by with no winners, the jackpot can get very large; it has
been over $100,000,000.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Which of the following statements are supported
by the principles of probability?  Give a yes or no answer to each, with
a few words of explanation.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.1)</B>  If you pay $2.00 for two different
sets of numbers, you are twice as likely to win as if you paid $1.00.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.2)</B>  If you pay $100.00 for 100 different
sets of numbers, you are 100 times as likely to win as if you paid $1.00.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.3)</B>  If you buy one ticket for every
drawing for ten years, your chances of winning are roughly a thousand times
greater than if you buy just one ticket.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.4)</B>  If you decide to play the same
six numbers in every draw from now on, you should check the winning numbers
in the past to be sure your numbers haven&#39;t come up already.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.5)</B>  If you play for a few months
and not a single number you choose is included in the winning numbers, you
are a little more likely to win the next draw (because you&#39;re &quot;due&quot;)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.6)</B>  If you play for a few months
and two or three of your numbers are included in the winning numbers of
each draw, you are a little more likely to win the next draw (because you&#39;re
&quot;on a roll&quot;).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.7)</B>  Since 50% of the ticket revenues
goes to prizes, in general the expected value of a $1.00 ticket is 50 cents.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.8)</B>  The expected value of your $1.00
ticket will will be higher if you only play when the jackpot is over $10,000,000.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.9)</B> Your probability of winning is
greater if you pick numbers between 1 and 31 (because many people pick birthdates
as their numbers).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.10)</B> Your expected value is greater
if you pick numbers greater than 31.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.11)</B>  (extra credit--we won&#39;t
ask you to do something like this on an exam) Calculate the probability
of winning the SuperLotto jackpot.  </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(c.12)</B>  (extra credit)  Calculate the
expected value of playing a $1.00 SuperLotto ticket.  The hard part about
this isn&#39;t the calculation; it&#39;s finding the payout amounts over
the last year.  They&#39;re not available at the California Lottery web
site (</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.calottery.com">www.calottery.com</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>),
and we don&#39;t know if they&#39;re available anywhere, so this is an opportunity
for you to do some creative web searching.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(d)</B>  [from <I>Patterns of Problem Solving</I>
by Moshe F. Rubinstein] In one brief sentence, how is information related
to probability?</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>If you know that 5 people out of every 1000
have cancer, and if we have a perfectly accurate test that predicts whether
a person has cancer, which of the following gives us more information:</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* The test indicates that a person has cancer.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>* The test indicates that a person does not
have cancer.</FONT></P>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>What to turn in:</B>  A word processing
document that includes the answers to all the questions in each part above.
 Grading depends on completeness, thoroughness, correctness, and clarity.</FONT></P>
