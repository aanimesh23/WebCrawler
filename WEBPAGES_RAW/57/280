<h1>    Filtering Search: A New Approach to Query-Answering 
</h1>
<h2> By Bernard Chazelle </h2>
<h2> Presented by Darren Strash, UCI</h2>

<p>
I will present a classic technique for solving retrieval problems 
(problems where we want to report objects that satisfy a query), 
and apply this technique to well-known problems such as Orthogonal 
Range Searching and Segment Intersection.
