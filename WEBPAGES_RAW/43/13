<H1>Welcome to the UCI Machine Learning Repository!</H1>


<P><i>We have re-designed our web site to enable better 
searching of data sets.  You can take a look at 
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml">new site here</a>.  We 
would appreciate any feedback that you may have regarding this new 
site (send emails to ml-repository '@' ics.uci.edu).</i> 

<p>
This is a repository of databases, domain theories and 
data generators that are used by the machine learning 
community for the empirical analysis of machine learning 
algorithms.<P>

<P>
  </ul>

An important file to read regarding the repository is the 
<A HREF = "ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/machine-learning-databases/README">
README</A> file.  It contain an overall description of the 
repository.  Another file, 
<A HREF = "ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/machine-learning-databases/SUMMARY-TABLE">
SUMMARY-TABLE</A>, contains a table of some of the databases. 
Each database is characterized by a fixed set of attributes.<P>

A few of the databases have 
<A HREF = "http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLRestricted.html">
restricted access</A>.  These databases include:  breast-cancer, 
lymphography, and primary-tumor.<P>

The construction of this repository is an on-going process. The 
majority of the entries in the repository were contributed by 
machine learning researchers outside of UCI. If you have or know 
of an entry that we should include here, let us know.  We are 
always interested in 
<A HREF = "http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLDonations.html">
donations</A>.<P>

We also maintain a list of 
<A HREF = "http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLOther.html">
other machine learning sites</A>.  Some of these sites are 
repositories of databases, while other sites are repositories 
of programs and papers. General ML and AI related sites are 
also included in the list.  Let us know if we are missing a 
cite that you have found useful. <p>

If you publish material based on databases obtained from this 
repository, then, in your acknowledgments, please note the 
<A HREF = "http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLAck1.html">
assistance you received</A> by using this repository. This will 
help others to obtain the same data sets and replicate your 
experiments.  We suggest the following pseudo-APA reference 
format for referring to this repository:<P>
