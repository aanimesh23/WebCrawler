<b>Install Python before installing Eclipse.</b>
<p>
You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing Eclipse.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely before performing the action that it
  describes.
This document shows downloading and installing Eclipse on MacOS X in Fall 2014.

<h2>Eclipse: Version 4.4 (Luna)</h2>
<p>

The Eclipse download requires about 200 MB of disk space; keep it on your
  machine, in case you need to re-install Eclipse.
When installed, Eclipse requires an additional 200 MB of disk space.
<p>

<h3>Downloading</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/Luna/R" target="_blank">
      Eclipse</a><p>
    The following page will appear in your browser.
    In this handout we will download <b>Eclipse Standard 4.4</b> for Mac OS.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/eclipsedownloadpage.png">
    <p>
    It is critical that Java, Python, and Eclipse are either all 32 Bit or are
       all 64 Bit (and only if your Machine/OS supports 64 Bit): I think it
       easiest on Macs to use 64 Bit for everything.

<p>
<li>Click the <b>64-bit</b> after <b>Mac Cocoa</b> for your machine,
       to the right of <b>Eclipse Standard 4.4</b> (right under <b>Eclipse
       Luna R Packages</b>).
    <p>
    You will see the following page (don't worry about the name of the
      institution to the right of the big downward pointing arrow).
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/mirror.png">
     
<p>
<li>Click the big downward pointing arrow underneath the
      <b>Download eclipse-standard-luna-R-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.tar.gz from:</b>
    The site named here, in purple to the right of the arrow:
      <b>[United States] ibiblio (http)</b> is the
      random one chosen by the download page this time; yours may differ.
    <p>
    If you see the following pop-up window
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/savetodownloads.png">
    <p>
    ensure the <b>Save File</b> radio button is depressed and click <b>OK</b>.
    <p>
    This file should start downloading in your standard download folder.
    This file is about 200 Mb so it might take a while to download fully if you
      are on a slow internet connection (it took me a few minutes over a
      cable modem).
    Don't worry about the exact time as long as the download continues to make
      steady progress.
    <p>
    After the download has finished, terminate the window browsing the Eclipse
      download.

<p>
<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Eclipse
      (and reinstall it later, if necessary).
<p>
<li>Start the <b>Installing</b> instructions directly below.
</ol>

<p>
<hr align="left" width="33%">

<h3>Installing (for Python)</h3>

<b>Python and Java should be installed before installing Eclipse</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Unzip <b>eclipse-standard-luna-R-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.tar.gz</b> by
      double-clicking it.
    <p>
    Unzipping this file creates a folder named <b>eclipse</b>; unzipping
      200 MB can take a few minutes.
    You can leave this folder here or move it elsewhere on your hard disk.

<p>
<li>Create an alias on the desktop to to the <b>eclipse</b> file in
      this <b>eclipse</b> folder: <img src="images/eclipse/mac/eclipseexeapp.png">
    <br>
    On the Mac, you can
    <ul>
    <li>Control-click the file <b>eclipse.exe</b>
    <li>Select the <b>Make Alias</b> option.
    <li>Move it to the desktop.
    </ul>
    <p>
    Now you are ready to perform a <b>one-time only</b> setup of Eclipse on
      your machine.

<p>
<li>Double-click the alias to Eclipse that you just created above.
    <p>
    If the following pop-up window appears
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/frominternet.png">
    <p>
    click <b>Open</b>.
    <p>
    The following splash screen will appear
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/splash.png">
    <p>
    and then a <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/workspacelauncher.png">
    <p>
    In the <b>Workspace</b> text box, your name should appear between
      <b>/Users</b> and <b>/Documents</b>, instead of <b>ellenolshansky</b>
      (I did this on my wife's Mac).
    <p>
    Leave <b>unchecked</b> the 
      <b>Use this as the default and do not ask again</b> box.
    Although you will use this same workspace for the entire quarter (checking
      projects in and out of it), it is best to see this
      <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window each time you start Eclipse, to
      remind you where your workspace is located.
    <p>
    In fact, it is a good idea to create on your desktop an alias to your
      workspace folder; but you must click <b>OK</b> (see below) before
      Eclipse creates this folder and you can alias it.

<li>Click <b>OK</b>.
    <p>
    Progress bars will appear as Eclipse loads.
    <p>
    Eventually the Eclipse workbench will appear with a <b>Welcome</b> tab
      covering it.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/welcome.png">

<p>
<li>Terminate (click <b>X</b> on) the <b>Welcome</b> tab.
    <p>
    You will not see the <b>Welcome</b> tab when you start Eclipse again, after
      this first time.

<p>
<li>Click <b>Help</b> (on the far right of the top toolbar) and then click
      <b>Install New Software...</b> in its pull-down menu, as shown below.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/installnewsoftware.png">
    <p>
    The <b>Install</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/install.png">

<p>
<li>Enter the text (or cut/paste from this document)
      <b>http://pydev.org/updates</b> into the <b>Work with</b> text box and
      press <b>Enter</b> (if that doesn't work, try
      <b>http://www.pydev.org/updates</b>).
    <p>
    In a few seconds the information under <b>Name</b> should change from<br>
    <b>There is no site selected</b> to <b>Pending</b> to
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/pydev.png">
    <p>
    Select only the top <b>PyDev</b> checkbox; do <b>NOT</b> select the 
      <b>PyDev Mylyn Integration (optional)</b> box.<br>
    Check before proceeding that the <b>Install</b> pop-up window appears as
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/installdone.png">

<p>
<li>Click <b>Next &gt;</b>
    <p>
    A new <b>Install</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/review.png">

<p>
<li>Click <b>Next &gt;</b>
    <p>
    A new <b>Install</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    Selecet the <b>I accept the terms of the license agreement</b> radio button,
      so the window appears as
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/reviewlicense.png">

<p>
<li>Click <b>Finish</b>
    <p>
    An <b>Installing Software</b> pop-up window will appear.
    During installation, it will show the various operations it is
      performing and a progress bar for each one.
    Because the installer is fetching various files online, this process might
      take a few minutes.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/installing.png">
    <p>
    The installation will pause, and  a <b>Selection Needed</b> pop-up window
      appears.
<p>
<li>Check the box labeled <b>Brainwy Software; Pydev; Brainwy</b>.
    <p>
    Check before proceeding that the <b>Install</b> pop-up window appears as
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipse/mac/selection.png">

<p>
<li>Click <b>OK</b>
    <p>
    The installation will finish (showing the final progress bars).
    <p>
    A <b>Software Updates</b> pop-up window will appear.

     the top tool bar), and then click <b>Preferences</b> in its pull-down
     menu, as shown below.
    <p>
