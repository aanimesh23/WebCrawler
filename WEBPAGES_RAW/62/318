		<P>Note that there's many optional points in the lab which you can explore.&nbsp; 
			All these can earn you bonus points.</P>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<P>This lab has 2 parts.&nbsp; First you'll generalize the binary search algorithm 
			you wrote in lab2 into "trinary" search (and optionally you can generalize that 
			to "n-ary" search for any n=2,3,...).&nbsp; Second, you'll time all these 
			search algorithms, plot their average running times and compare these to the 
			theoretical analysis of the (worst-case) running time of these n-ary search 
			algorithms.</P>
		<P>The point of this lab is that you learn how to:
		</P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			generalize a binary search algorithm and generalize algorithms in general,
			<LI>
				compute actual&nbsp;<EM>average</EM> <EM>running time </EM>of <EM>your implemention 
					of an algorithm</EM>
			running on some particular architecture, by clocking your code and 
			then&nbsp;averaging the timing samples on sample data points
			<LI>
				do a theoretical, i.e. "big-O", analysis of a running time of an algorithm 
				(which is always a <EM>worst case running time</EM>
			analysis),
			<LI>
			compare the results of the theoretical analysis of the (worst case) running 
			time of the algorithm with the experimental results which show the average 
			running time of your implementation of this algorithm
			<LI>
				draw conclusions:
				<UL>
					<LI>
					is the "big-O" worst-case running time function a good predictor of the 
					average-time behaviour of your implementation of this algorithm?&nbsp;
					<LI>
					what are the discrepancies due to?&nbsp; can the average case and the worst 
					case differ much?&nbsp; was it justifiable to ignore the low-order terms which 
					are indeed ignored by the "big-O" analysis?
					<LI>
						what's the actual cost of the "primitve operations" on the particular 
						architecture where your implementation of the algorithm ran?</LI></UL>

		<h3>Part Ia:&nbsp;Generalize the Binary Search Algorithm from Lab2 to Trinary (and 
			"n-ary") Search</h3>
		<P>Modify the binary search algorithm in lab2 so that it does a "trinary" search 
			instead.&nbsp; Recall that the binary search examines the value at the middle m 
			= (f+i)/2 = i + (f-i)/2 of the searched-for interval [i,f] (of ordered values 
			between some initial point i and the final point f), and then recursively calls 
			the binary search on either the [i,m] or the [m,f] half of this [i,f] 
			inverval.&nbsp; The base case of the binary search algorithm is this:&nbsp; If 
			the searched-for interval is so small that it cannot be split into two smaller 
			fragments, i.e. when f-i &lt; 2, then the algorithm "manually" examines each of 
			the values in the interval, i.e. simply the value at point i and the value at 
			point f.&nbsp; (Note that if f-i &lt; 2 then we either have f=i or f=i+1.)</P>
		<P>A *trinary* search algorithm searches such [i,f] interval by examining the 
			values at 1/3 and the 2/3 of the interval, i.e. by examining the values at 
			point m1 = i + 1/3*(f-i) and m2 = i + 2/3*(f-i), and then, depending on how do 
			these values compare with the searched-for value, the trinary search algorithm 
			recursively calls the trinary search on *either* the [i,m1] interval, or the 
			[m1,m2] interval, or the [m2,f] interval.&nbsp; The base case of the trinary 
			search algorithm is similar to that of the binary search:&nbsp; If the 
			searched-for interval is so small that it cannot be split into even smaller 
			fragments, then the algorithm examines the remaning values one-by-one.&nbsp;
		</P>
		<P>As you generalize the binary search to trinary one, these are the things you 
			need to think about:</P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			make sure that the all the choices of the recursive calls taken together cover 
			the whole interval region, i.e. no elements will ever be missed, for example 
			because of the effect of rounding.
			<LI>
			at the same time, make sure that when the search procedure invoked on arguments 
			(i,f) makes a recursive call to the itself, it can always do so only if the 
			arguments (i',f') it calls with are such that f'-i' is strictly smaller than 
			f-i.&nbsp; Only making sure that this is true can guarantee that your algorithm 
			does not enter an infinite loop.
			<LI>
				make sure that the base case covers all the possibilities that can occur when 
				the interval is small enough, i.e. the value f-i is small enough, that the base 
				case needs to kick in.</LI></OL>
		<P>[Optionally, you can generalize this even further, and code a general "n-ary 
			search" algorithm which given an argument n does the search by splitting the 
			searched-for interval into n fragments and searching them recursively via the 
			"n-ary search".&nbsp; (It might be that the base case of the n-ary search will 
			have to depend on n, but maybe that will not be necessary.]
			<H3>PartIb: Theoretical analysis of the running time of the search algorithms</H3>
		<P>Do the (theoretical) analysis of the (worst-case) running time of the binary 
			search *and* the trinary search algorithms.&nbsp; We want the running time to 
			be expressed in terms of just one variable:&nbsp; n, the *size* of the searched 
			interval.&nbsp; Note that in the case of the savings calculator application in 
			lab2, the size n of the searched interval is equal to n = 100t/m where t is the 
			target amount in cents, and m is the the number of months.&nbsp; In the running 
			time analysis consider m, the number of months, as a constant.&nbsp; For 
			example, set m = 60, which&nbsp;corresponds to dealing with 5-year saving 
			plans.&nbsp; (Note also that the running time of all these algorithmsdoes not 
			depend on the interest rate r.)&nbsp; The analysis will give you some running 
			time functions, T<SUB>bs</SUB>(n) and&nbsp;T<SUB>ts</SUB>
		(n), for the binary search and the trinary search, correspondingly.&nbsp; What 
		is the O() notation for both of these functions?
		<P>Compare the running times of the binary and the trinary search algorithms.&nbsp; 
			Are they asymptotically the same or one is larger than the other?&nbsp; Even if 
			they are the same in the O() sense, i.e. if T<SUB>bs</SUB>(n) = O(T<SUB>ts</SUB>(n)) 
			and also T<SUB>ts</SUB>(n) = O(T<SUB>bs</SUB>
		(n)), try to think about the constants in fhe functions themselves:&nbsp; Can 
		you hypothesize which function will dominate the other?
		<P>
			[Optionally, you can check what's the asymptotic behaviour of the running time 
			function of general n-ary search, and compare it to the others.&nbsp; What's 
			the optimal value of n?]</P>
		<P>[Optionally, you can consider both m and n the variables for the running time 
			function.&nbsp; In the book we talked about the running-time function as only a 
			function T(n) of one single variable n that represents the "size of the 
			problem", but one often wants to express the runnning time as a&nbsp;function 
			of more than just one variable.&nbsp; In the case of the savings calculator 
			application, it'd be convient to consider its running time as a function of <EM>two</EM>&nbsp;variables, 
			n and m, i.e.&nbsp;some function&nbsp;T(m,n).&nbsp; The definition of the O() 
			notation for the two-variable function is very similar to the single-variable 
			definition:&nbsp;&nbsp;We say that T(m,n) is O(F(m,n)) for some other function 
			F(m,n) if there exist&nbsp;a constant c&gt;0 and <EM>two</EM> points m0 and n0 
			s.t. for all m&gt;m0 and all n&gt;n0 we have that T(m,n) &lt;= c * 
			F(m,n).&nbsp; When you do the running-time experiments in the second part of 
			the lab (see below), you can gather the information also as a function of these 
			two variables, m and n, and compare such results to the O() expression for the 
			T(m,n) function you derive here using pen and paper.]
			<h3>Part IIa:&nbsp;&nbsp;Gather experimental data about average-case time of your 
				binary and trinary search algorithms</h3>
		<P>
			First you need to implement the timer.&nbsp; Use an appropriate timer class 
			from the&nbsp; <A href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/overview-tree.html">
				java Class library</A>
		&nbsp;to clock the time before and after your search algorithm runs.&nbsp; We 
		are interested in the running time of your implementation as a function of n, 
		where n = 100t/m, where m is fixed, as we said above, to m=60.&nbsp; [Of course 
		optionally you can explore the running time of your algorithm as a function of 
		both n and m.]&nbsp; Since n is not an explicit variable which your algorithm 
		takes as an input, this means that in order to test the time of the algorithm 
		as a function of n you need to run the algorithm on input t = n*m / 100.&nbsp; 
		(Recall that t denotes the target amount.)&nbsp;
		<P>Moreover, we want to examine the <EM>average</EM>
		running time, as a function of n, and not just a running time of a single 
		instance of your algorithm for a particular interest rate r.&nbsp; (Once n and 
		m are fixed, the only other input that determines how your code is executed 
		will be the interest rate r.)&nbsp;&nbsp; How can we do this?&nbsp; Simply, for 
		every n, you should examine the average running time of your algorithm by 
		averaging the times observed in k executions of your code, each one executing 
		with the same parameter n.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's up to you to determine the useful 
		value of k, but you can start with k=100.&nbsp; In each of these k instances 
		you should run the algorithm with the same n but you should vary the r 
		parameter.&nbsp; For example you can take say that the i-th execution should 
		run with r = 0.05 +&nbsp;0.01 * i/k, which will effectively range r between 5% 
		and 6%.&nbsp; Or you can assign in each instance r using a random number 
		generator.&nbsp; (But make sure that it falls into some reasonable region, 
		definitely different than 0 or 1, because&nbsp;if r is either 0 or 1 your code 
		might exhibit very non-average behaviour...)
		<P>The result of all the above should be a procedure, for example called (binary or 
			trinary search) <EM>test</EM>
		, which takes parameters k and n, and outputs the average running time of 
		k&nbsp;instances of the (binary or trinary) search algorithm, each of which 
		executes on the same input size n (and each of which runs on some 
		average-looking interest rate r and on m=60).
		<P>Now, to analyze them, gather your results in an array of results for some 
			realistic n values.&nbsp; Pick the n values in the array so that you can easily 
			observe the dependance between the (average) running time and these 
			values.&nbsp; For example, if you have good reasons to believe that the running 
			time of your algorithm is a <EM>linear</EM> function of n, you will want your n 
			values spread linearly, e.g. n<SUB>i</SUB> = a * i for some constant a.&nbsp; 
			If, on the other hand, you think that your running time is logarithmtic, then 
			the running times will be easier to observe if you observe the results for n's 
			spread <EM>exponentially,&nbsp;</EM>e.g. n<SUB>i</SUB> =&nbsp;2<SUP>i</SUP> or 
			n<SUB>i</SUB> =&nbsp;10<SUP>i</SUP>
		.&nbsp; In any event, you should program a procedure which iterates over n 
		values in an array of test cases, runs the above test for each of them, and 
		gathers the outputs in an array of outputs.&nbsp; Then you can populate the 
		array of test cases with linearly-spaced n's and see if the results are 
		informative.&nbsp; If not, populate the array of test cases with 
		exponentially-spaced n's and rerun the process.&nbsp; Note that if you start 
		with too-big values, your code will run forever.&nbsp; If on the other hand you 
		use too-small values, the results will be random-looking and hard to 
		interpret.&nbsp; This is exactly why you need to program the *procedures* that 
		take any array of test cases and runs any number k of tests on each.&nbsp; 
		Using these procedures you can easily then change the k parameter and the test 
		inputs and see what they need to be in order for you to get observable and easy 
		to interpret results!
		<P>
			Finally, once you get some easy-to-interprest results, <EM>plot them </EM>
		on a graph.&nbsp; On the x-axis there should be the different values of n, and 
		on the y-axis there should be the average running time of the algorithm for a 
		given n.&nbsp; Your solutions can contain two such plots:&nbsp; One for the 
		binary and one for the trinary algorithms.&nbsp; The two plots should use the 
		same test cases n.&nbsp; Even better, you can draw a single plot, with two 
		lines (or curves):&nbsp; In one color the line representing the average running 
		times of the binary search algorithm, and in the other color the same for the 
		trinary search.
		<P>For the code part, you should submit a code you used to test organized as I'm 
			suggesting above, and with a description of how it can be used to do the 
			testing:&nbsp; Where do you set the k value, where do you populate the test 
			cases.&nbsp; The results should be displayed in some easy to read way, but they 
			do not need to be plotted on the screen.
			<h3>PartIIb: Compare the experimental data and the theoretically-derived runnig 
				time</h3>
		<P>Answer the following questions:</P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
				Which algorithm seems better in practice?&nbsp; How can you explain it?&nbsp; 
				[Optionally, what's the optimal n for the n-ary search?]</LI>
			<LI>
				How do the experimental results compare to the theoretically-derived running 
				time functions&nbsp;T<SUB>bs</SUB>(n) and&nbsp;T<SUB>ts</SUB> (n)?&nbsp; Note 
				that the T(n) functions represent the worst-case running time and the 
				experimental results report an average-running time.&nbsp; Are the two 
				different in this case?&nbsp; Why or why not?&nbsp;
			</LI>
			<LI>
				If the average-case and the worst-case are similar in this case, is the 
				average-case bahaviour <EM>exactly</EM> matching the theoretically derived 
				one?&nbsp; What are the discrepancies and how can you explain them?</LI></OL>
		<P>[Optional idea:&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use this experiment to estimate the cost of 
			the arithmetic operations compared to the cost of the other operations (like 
			comparisons, look-ups, variable assignments, and everything else this code 
			does).&nbsp; You can see this by replacing floats with doubles (or vice versa) 
			in the interest-rate operations in the amount-saved procedure, and observing 
			whether the running time changes by much.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can, maybe you 
			can&nbsp;do all the operations on the integers (it'd be sligtly tricky but it 
			might be possible).&nbsp; You can test if this speeds it up.]</P>
