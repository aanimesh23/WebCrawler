The objective of the Electronic Systems Test Workshop (ESTW) is to
bring together researchers in all of the fields related to the test of
entire systems. The heterogeneous nature of electronic system design
calls for coordination between different research communities in order
to address the system test problem. Currently research in each related
field is performed by largely distinct research communities including
digital IC test, mixed-signal test, embedded systems test,
hardware/software co-simulation, and software test. As a result, there
has been little effort towards the development of a coherent science
of system test. This workshop is intended to be a forum for the broad
collaboration required to establish a research foundation for the
field of system test.  

<p>

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

<ul>


<li> Diagnosis : Resolution vs. Repair Cost
    <li> System-level Fault Tolerance
    <li> Self-Repairing Systems
    <li> Embedded System Testing
    <li> System-Level Built-In Self-Test
    <li> Hardware/Software Co-simulation
    <li> Testing of Concurrent/Globally Asynchronous Systems
    <li> System Fault Characterization
    <li> System-Level Functional Test
    <li> Integration Testing
    <li> On-line System Test
    <li> Testing of Real-Time Systems

</ul>


ESTW submissions must be made electronically in PDF format through the
ESTW web site. Reference the <a
href="http://testlab.ics.uci.edu/estw"> ESTW web page </a> for
instructions on electronic submissions.

<p>

Authors should submit one PDF file which should contain the
complete paper including the title and abstract. This file should
not be more than 4 pages.

<p>

The proceedings of this workshop will not be published. Proceedings
  will be distributed to workshop attendees.
