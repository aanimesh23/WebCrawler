<p class="title">What is a newsgroup?</p>

<p>Before there was a World Wide Web, a common form of communication on the Internet was via <i>newsgroups</i>.  A newsgroup is a bulletin board that allows users to conduct discussions centered around a particular topic, somewhat like today's Web logs (commonly called "blogs").  Despite their declining popularity, tens of thousands of newsgroups still exist on the Internet, covering a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>Since newsgroups predate the existence of the Web, they operate on a completely different protocol.  As a result, you can't read newsgroups with a Web browser.  Instead, you need software called a <i>news reader</i>.  Fortunately, one of the most common email software packages for Windows, Microsoft Outlook Express, contains a news reader.  The full Netscape/Mozilla package does, too, as part of its email software (which is called Communicator); similarly, Mozilla's Thunderbird package also provides this support.</p>

<p>If you prefer, you can download dedicated news reader software, such as <a href="http://www.forteinc.com/">Forte Free Agent</a>.  Dedicated news readers tend to have a great deal more functionality (such as extracting binary files from sets of combined newsgroup messages), at the cost of a substantial increase in complexity.  If you're new to this stuff, I suggest using Outlook Express or one of the Mozilla products.</p>

<p class="title">Connecting to a news server</p>

<p>In order to set up any news reader software, you need at least the following pieces of information:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>News server</b> or <b>NNTP server</b>: news.service.uci.edu</li>
  <li><b>Username/password</b>: your UCInetID and password</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to read a newsgroup, you need to connect to a <i>news server</i> (also known as an <i>NNTP server</i>).  News servers keep copies of messages from a wide variety of groups and allow you to download them.  Some groups, like <b>alt.music.counting-crows</b>, are distributed worldwide.  Our course newsgroup, <b>ics.184</b>, is distributed only on the UCI news server, since it concerns only UCI students.</p>

<p>Most news servers require a login and password.  UCI's news service requires you to log in with your UCInetID and password.</p>

<p>With this information, you should be able to configure any news reader software properly, though it can be a bit tricky if you're not familiar with the software.  So, in the following section, I'll explain how to set up Outlook Express as your news reader.</p>

<p class="title">Setting up Outlook Express as your news reader</p>

<p>Follow this set of steps and you should be able to read and write messages on our newsgroup:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect yourself to the Internet.  You need to be connected when you first set up your news reader software.</li>
  <li>Start up Outlook Express.  Go to the Tools menu and select "Accounts..."</li>
  <li>On the ensuing dialog, click the "Add" button and select "News..." on the resulting menu.</li>
  <li>Next, you'll be taken through the "Internet Connection Wizard".  Enter your name and email, as requested, clicking the "Next" button after each.</li>
  <li>Now enter <b>news.service.uci.edu</b> into the field marked "News (NNTP) server".  Be sure to check the box marked "My news server requires me to log on", then click the "Next" button.</li>
  <li>Into the field marked "Account name", type your UCInetID.</li>
  <li>Into the field marked "Password", type your UCInetID's password.  Go ahead and check the "Remember password" box, so you won't have to re-type your password every time.  Don't check the box marked "Log on using Secure Password Authentication (SPA)".</li>
  <li>Click the "Next" button, then click "Finish" and you're ready to connect.</li>
  <li>Next, you'll be asked if you want to download a list of newsgroups.  Click the "Yes" button.  (If you're on a dial-up connection, this may take a little time, but it only has to be done once.)</li>
  <li>Now you should see a list of newsgroups.  Select <b>ics.184</b> from the list and click the "Subscribe" button.</li>
  <li>Finally, press the "Go To" button, and you should see a list of all of the messages on our newsgroup!</li>
</ol>

<p class="title">What should I do if I don't want to use Outlook Express?</p>

<p>Get yourself some other news reader software and read its documentation.  I don't have any other news reader software installed, so you'll be on your own to figure out how to set it up.  Just remember, the things you need to know are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>News server</b> or <b>NNTP server</b>: news.service.uci.edu</li>
  <li>Login and password are required.</li>
  <li>Your login is your UCInetID, your password is your UCInetID password.</li>
</ul>
