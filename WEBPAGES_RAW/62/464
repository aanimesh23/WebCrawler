Abstract

   This memo proposes a mechanism for representing a [WEBDAV] resource
   as a MIME entity, bundling together the resource's body,
   properties, and member resources.

1.      Introduction

   [WEBDAV] defines behavior for HTTP resources beyond that defined in
   [HTTP1.1]; this behavior includes storing metainformation (called
   "properties", and formatted as [XML]) and being able to list the
   members of collection resources (which correspond to subdirectories
   in a filesystem).  In some applications, it will be useful to be
   able to encapsulate all aspects of such an enhanced resource into a
   single document; for example, if a DAV server implementor wishes to
   support cross-server COPY, it will be most efficient if there is
   some way to deliver the resource being copied to the destination
   server in a single operation.  This memo proposes an [XML] syntax
   for describing a resource, and a profile for bundling the
   description together with the resource's MIME content into a
   multipart/related entity ([RFC-2387]).

2.      XML Syntax

   (Author's note: the following is an informal description of the
   proposed syntax.  A DTD can be created if and when necessary.)

2.1     <DAV:resource>

   The description of a DAV resource is represented by an XML
   <DAV:resource> element (where DAV: represents the same namespace as
   in [WEBDAV]).  A <DAV:resource> element may contain the following
   elements (each is optional; none may appear more than once):

        <DAV:prop>      as defined in [WEBDAV]; represents properties
                        of the resource

        <DAV:body>      defined below

        <DAV:members>   defined below

        <DAV:href>      as defined in [WEBDAV]; used only in a
                        <DAV:resource> contained in a <DAV:members>.  
                        Must be a relative URI with no path
                        separators.  Represents the URI of the
                        resource, relative to the URI of the resource
                        described by the enclosing <DAV:resource>. a 

2.2     <DAV:body>

   A <DAV:body> element supplies a MIME entity which is to constitute
   the resource's body (that is, the entity which would be supplied in
   response to a successful GET).  It may contain either a <DAV:src>
   element ([WEBDAV]), which supplies a URI for an external entity, or
   a <DAV:xmlbody> (below), which supplies XML for an inline XML
   entity.  These two are mutually exclusive.

   Note that it is legal for a <DAV:resource> to contain both a
   <DAV:body> and a <DAV:members>, since GET on a collection resource
   is legal (and quite common).  If this is the case, and the
   <DAV:members> also contains a member resource which might otherwise
   be provided in response to GET (e.g., a resource whose relative
   href is "index.html"), then the <DAV:body> MUST take precedence
   over the member resource.  (This is to ensure predictability: if a
   server is provided with a <DAV:resource> representing a collection,
   the creator of the collection may not know which relative hrefs the
   server recognizes as default documents.)

2.3     <DAV:xmlbody>

   A <DAV:xmlbody> is used to include an XML document in the resource
   description, rather than referring to an external entity.  When
   <DAV:xmlbody> is used, it means that the resource's body is the
   contents of the <DAV:xmlbody> element.  The element may have a
   "type" attribute, which corresponds to a Content-type header on the
   entity (this is necessary because an XML document may be either
   text/xml or application/xml).

2.4     <DAV:members>

   A <DAV:members> element lists the member resources of a collection.
   A <DAV:members> element MUST NOT be present if the <DAV:prop>
   element specifies (via DAV:resourcetype) that the resource is not a
   collection.  The <DAV:members> element contains zero or more
   <DAV:resource> elements which describe the collection's member
   resources.

3.      Use of multipart/related

   A multipart/related entity may be used to bundle the description of
   a resource with entities representing the body of the resource and
   its members (if applicable).  In this case, <DAV:body> elements may
   use cid: URIs to refer to body parts of the multipart/related.

4.      Examples

   (DUBLIN: properties are Dublin Core metadata, as described in
   [DUBLIN] and [DUBLIN-DAV].)

4.1     An XML resource with an inline body

   <DAV:resource>
    <DAV:prop>
     <DAV:getcontenttype>text/xml</DAV:getcontenttype>
     <DUBLIN:Title>Moonlight and Vines</DUBLIN:Title>
     <DUBLIN:Creator>Charles de Lint</DUBLIN:Creator>
    </DAV:prop>

    <DAV:body>
     <DAV:xmlbody>
      <book>
       <poem>
        <title>Sweetgrass & City Streets</title>
        <content>...</content>
       </poem>

       <story>
        <title>Saskia</title>
        <content>...</content>
       </story>

       <story>
        <title>In This Soul Of A Woman</title>
        <content>...</content>
       </story>

       ...

      </book>
     </DAV:xmlbody>
    </DAV:body>

   </DAV:resource>

4.2     A GIF resource with an external body

   <DAV:resource>
    <DAV:prop>
     <DAV:getcontenttype>image/gif</DAV:getcontenttype>
     <DUBLIN:Title>IETF Logo</DUBLIN:Title>
    </DAV:prop>

    <DAV:body>
     <DAV:src>
      <DAV:href>http://www.ietf.org/images/ietflogo2e.gif</DAV:href>
     </DAV:src>
    </DAV:body>

   </DAV:resource>

4.3     A collection, containing three external HTML pages

   <DAV:resource>
    <DAV:prop>
     <DAV:resourcetype><DAV:collection/></DAV:resourcetype>
    </DAV:prop>

    <DAV:members>
     <DAV:resource>
      <DAV:prop>
       <DUBLIN:title>IETF Home Page</DUBLIN:title>
      </DAV:prop>

      <DAV:body>
       <DAV:src>
        <DAV:href>http://www.ietf.org/index.html</DAV:href>
       </DAV:src>
      </DAV:body>

      <DAV:href>index.html</DAV:href>
     </DAV:resource>

     <DAV:resource>
      <DAV:prop>
       <DUBLIN:title>IETF Overview</DUBLIN:title>
      </DAV:prop>

      <DAV:body>
       <DAV:src>
        <DAV:href>http://www.ietf.org/overview.html</DAV:href>
       </DAV:src>
      </DAV:body>

      <DAV:href>overview.html</DAV:href>
     </DAV:resource>

     <DAV:resource>
      <DAV:prop>
       <DUBLIN:title>IESG</DUBLIN:title>
      </DAV:prop>

      <DAV:body>
       <DAV:src>
        <DAV:href>http://www.ietf.org/iesg.html</DAV:href>
       </DAV:src>
      </DAV:body>

      <DAV:href>iesg.html</DAV:href>
     </DAV:resource>

    </DAV:members>

   </DAV:resource>

4.4     A reference

   Note that this resource does not have a body; it is defined wholly
   by its properties.

   <DAV:resource>
    <DAV:prop>
     <DAV:resourcetype><DAV:reference/></DAV:resourcetype>
     <DAV:reftype><DAV:direct/></DAV:reftype>
     <DAV:reftarget>http://www.ietf.org</DAV:resourcetype>
    </DAV:prop>

   </DAV:resource>

5.      Use with MKCOL

   [WEBDAV] specifies that MKCOL may have a request body, but does not
   specify any legal formats.  The syntax defined in this memo could
   be used for a MKCOL request body; by submitting either a
   <DAV:resource> or a multipart/related containing a <DAV:resource>,
   a client could provide the complete contents of a collection to be
   created.

6.      Acknowledgments

   The impetus for this memo was a discussion with Geoff Clemm on the
   WebDAV mailing list about the best way to represent structured
   documents.

7.      Security Considerations

   Security issues are not discussed in detail in this memo.  This
   memo describes only a means of encoding data which is already
   present in WebDAV; it does not introduce any new security risks
   beyond those of WebDAV itself.
