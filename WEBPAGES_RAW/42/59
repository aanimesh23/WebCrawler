So Amazed
by Arthur Asuncion


         Am             D 
I am so amazed by Your love
Bm                Em
You have saved my soul
          Am              D
I am not ashamed of Your love 
       Bm              Em           
I have got to let the whole world know
         Am           D
I wanna sing of Your love
   Bm            Em
So let the music flow
         Am          D
Give my heart now


Am                           D
How can I fully explain the love of Christ, my God, my King
     Bm                               Em 
Who humbly bore the wooden cross, to give my life and hope for tomorrow
Am                                         D
Can�t imagine though I may try, I"ll just let the praise well up inside
Bm            Em
Satisfied, yeah



Note: On the recording, a capo is used on the 1st fret and later on the 3rd fret
