<h2><a name='Keynotes'> Abstracts of Invited Talks </a> </h2>
<h3>Jeffrey P. Bigham : Crowd Agents: Interactive Crowd-Powered Systems in the Real World </h3>
<p>Over the past few years, we have been developing and deploying
interactive crowd-powered systems that help people get things done in
their everyday lives. For instance, VizWiz answers visual questions
for blind people in less than a minute, Legion drives robots in
response to natural language commands, Chorus supports consistent
dialog between end users and the crowd, and Scribe converts streaming
speech to text in less than five seconds. Overall, thousands of people
have engaged with these systems, providing an interesting look at how
end users interact with crowd work in their everyday lives. These
systems have collectively informed a new model for real-time crowd
work that I call “crowd agents,” which is proving to be especially
useful for building interactive crowd-powered systems. In this model,
a diverse and changing crowd – the kind easily recruited on the web –
is made to act as a single high-quality actor through interface
support and computational mediation of each individual’s work. These
systems allow us to deploy truly intelligent interactive systems
today, and present challenging problems for machine learning going
forward to support and eventually replace the humans in the loop.</p>
<h3>Yiling Chen: Financial Incentives and Crowd Work  </h3>
<p>Online labor markets such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) have emerged as platforms that facilitate the allocation of productive effort across global economies. Many of these markets compensate workers with monetary payments. We study the effects of performance-contingent financial rewards on work quality and worker effort in MTurk via two experiments. We find that the magnitude of performance-contingent financial rewards alone affects neither quality nor effort. However, when workers working on two tasks of the same type in a sequence, the change in the magnitude of the reward over the two tasks affects both. In particular, both work quality and worker effort increase (alternatively decrease) as the reward increases (alternatively decreases) for the second task. This suggests the existence of the anchoring effect on workers&rsquo; perception of incentives in MTurk and that this effect can be leveraged in workflow design to increase the effectiveness of financial incentives.</p>
<h3>Panagiotis G. Ipeirotis : Rewarding Crowdsourced Workers </h3>
<p>We describe techniques for rewarding workers in a
crowdsourcing setting. We describe a real-time monetary payment scheme
that rewards workers according to their quality, in the presence of
uncertainty in quality estimation, while at the same time guaranteeing
stable (or increasing) salaries. We report experimental results
indicating that the proposed scheme encourages long-term engagement,
avoiding churn, and avoiding the common problem of adverse selection
and moral hazard. We also describe a set of non-monetary,
psychological schemes that actively discourage low-quality workers
from participating in tasks. We finish showing that mice and
crowdsourced workers are not that different after all.</p>
<h3>Edith Law :  Mixed-Expertise Crowdsourcing </h3>
<p>To date, most of the research in human computation focuses on tasks that can be performed by any person with basic perceptual capabilities and common sense knowledge.  In this talk, I will discuss new directions towards mixed-expertise crowdsourcing, where the crowd consists of people with drastically different motivations, levels and domains of expertise, as well as availabilities.  I will illustrate the new opportunities and challenges in mixed-expertise crowdsourcing, by outlining existing work and describing my two ongoing projects &ndash; Curio, a micro-task marketplace for crowdsourcing scientific tasks, and SimplyPut, a crowdsourcing platform for improving health literacy through the collaborative summarization of medical information.</p>
<h3>Mark Steyvers: Aggregating Human Judgments in Combinatorial Problems </h3>
<p>We analyze the collective performance of individuals in combinatorial
problems involving the rankings of events and items (e.g. &ldquo;what is the
order of US presidents?&rdquo;) as well as traveling salesperson and minimum
spanning tree problems. We compare situations in which a group of
individuals independently answer these questions with an iterated
learning environment in which individuals pass their solution to the
next person in a chain. We introduce Bayesian information aggregation
models for both the independent and information-sharing environments
and treat the collective group knowledge as a latent variable that can
be estimated from the observed judgments across individuals. The
models allow for individual differences in expertise and confidence in
other individuals&rsquo; judgments. Initial results suggest that
information-sharing environments lead to better collective performance
despite the fact that information-sharing increases correlations
between judgments. In addition, the models’ estimates of expertise are
more indicative of actual performance than the users’ self-rated
expertise. Finally, we study situations where the same individual
solves the same problem at different points in time. We show that the
consistency  in answers across repeated problems provides an
additional signal to estimate expertise.</p>
