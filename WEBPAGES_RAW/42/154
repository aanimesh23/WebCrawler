2 Abstract

   This document specifies an extension to the [WEBDAV] PROPFIND method 
   to permit a WebDAV client to request all properties which belong to a
   specified namespace or namespaces.

3 Introduction

   This document specifies an extension to the [WEBDAV] PROPFIND method 
   to permit a WebDAV client to request all properties which belong to a
   specified namespace or namespaces.

   A WebDAV application using a custom namespace for 
   application-specific data may occasionally need to use PROPFIND to 
   list all a resource's properties from that namespace. (Similarly, a 
   WebDAV client might need to know all DAV: properties, but not care 
   about non-standard properties.) In such a case, the client must 
   choose between the <allprop> element, which will retrieve all 
   properties on the resource, and the <prop> element, which will 
   retrieve specified properties only. The problem with <allprop> is 
   that the resource may have many properties from other namespaces, in 
   which the application is not interested. The problem with <prop> is 
   that the client may not know all the property names which may be 
   present (for example, if the client is too general-purpose to permit 
   it to be configured with the list of property names, or if property 
   name munging is being used). A third choice would be to use

   <propname> to list all the resource's properties without their 
   contents, then use <prop> with just the properties in the desired 
   namespace; the problem with this approach is that it requires an 
   extra HTTP request.

   This document proposes a middle ground, an extension to <allprop> and
   <propname> which provides a list of namespaces to search.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [MUSTS] .

4 Extension definition

   Two new XML elements are proposed, <namespace> and <namespaces>. In 
   the idiom of [WEBDAV]:

4.1 namespaces XML Element

   Name: namespaces

   Namespace: DAV:

   Purpose: The namespaces XML element specifies that the enclosing 
   allprop or propname element applies only to properties belonging to 
   the namespaces listed in the enclosed namespace elements.

4.2 namespace XML Element

   Name: namespace

   Namespace: DAV:

   Purpose: The namespace XML element specifies a namespace in the 
   namespaces list. <namespace> appears inside <namespaces>, and has a 
   single attribute, uri, the URI of the namespace.

5 Examples

5.1 Fetching all DAV: properties

   Request:
         PROPFIND /index.html HTTP/1.1
         Host: www.example.com
         Content-Length: xxxx
         Content-Type: text/xml

         <D:propfind xmlns:D="DAV:">
         <D:allprop>
         <D:namespaces>
         <D:namespace uri="DAV:"/>
         </D:namespaces>
         </D:allprop>

         </D:propfind>


   Response:
         HTTP/1.1 200 OK
         Content-Type: text/xml
         Content-Length: xxxx

         <D:prop xmlns:D="DAV:">
         <D:lockentry>
         <D:lockscope><D:exclusive/></D:lockscope>
         <D:locktype><D:write/></D:locktype>
         </D:lockentry>

         <D:lockentry>
         <D:lockscope><D:shared/></D:lockscope>
         <D:locktype><D:write/></D:locktype>
         </D:lockentry>

         <D:creationdate>1999-08-11T12:12:12Z</D:creationdate>
         <D:displayname>Example.com, The Fictious Site!</D:displayname>
         <D:getcontentlength>17</D:getcontentlength>
         <D:getcontenttype>text/html</D:getcontenttype>
         <D:getetag>xyzzy</D:getetag>
         <D:getlastmodified>1999-08-11T12:12:14Z</D:getlastmodified>
         <D:resourcetype></D:resourcetype>

         </D:supportedlock>

         </D:prop>


5.2 Listing names of properties in two namespaces

   Request:
         PROPFIND /index.html HTTP/1.1
         Host: www.example.com
         Content-Length: xxxx
         Content-Type: text/xml

         <D:propfind xmlns:D="DAV:">
         <D:propname>
         <D:namespaces>
         <D:namespace uri="http://foo.example.com"/>
         <D:namespace uri="mailto:fred@example.com"/>
         </D:namespaces>
         </D:propfind>
         </D:propname>


   Response:
         <D:prop xmlns:D="DAV:"
         xmlns:F="http://foo.example.com"

INTERNET-DRAFT       WebDAV PROPFIND Namespace List      August 10, 1999

         xmlns:M="mailto:fred@example.com">
         <F:bar/>
         <M:fred/>
         </D:prop>


6 Compatibility Considerations

   Section 14 of [WEBDAV] specifies:

         "All DAV compliant resources MUST ignore any unknown XML 
         element and all its children encountered while processing a DAV
         method that uses XML as its command language."

   As a result, a client which uses <D:namespaces> on a server which 
   does not support it will get the base-level DAV behavior (listing all
   properties), exactly as if it had issued a base-level DAV request. 
   Therefore, a client which sends PROPFIND requests using 
   <D:namespaces> MUST accept responses which include properties not in 
   the listed namespace(s).

   Of course, it is always risky assuming that all implementations of a 
   young standard adhere to all points of the standard. In this case, 
   the risk is mitigated by the fact that section 23.3.2.2 of [WEBDAV] 
   presents a (hypothetical) similar extension, <E:leave-out>, and 
   states:

         "If the previous example were submitted to a server unfamiliar 
         with leave-out, the only result would be that the leave-out 
         element would be ignored and a propname would be executed."

   Nevertheless, since there may be some servers which, for whatever 
   reason, violate this prescription (say, if they attempt to validate 
   the XML request against the DTD in section 23.2 of [WEBDAV] ), a 
   client which uses <D:namespaces> SHOULD be aware that it may receive 
   a 400 Bad Request from such a server, and SHOULD be able to retry the
   request without using <D:namespaces>.

7 Internationalization Considerations

   This proposal builds on [WEBDAV], and inherits its 
   internationalizability.

8 IANA Considerations

   This proposal does not introduce any new IANA considerations, since 
   it does not specify any new namespaces (in the general sense), but 
   merely uses existing ones.

9 Security Considerations

   For a server, this proposal does not introduce any new security 
   considerations over those of [WEBDAV], since the information which is

   exposed is already available. There might be privacy considerations 
   for a client, since telling the server which namespaces one wishes to
   search does reveal some information. Implementors must balance this 
   concern against the efficiency gains this proposal offers.
