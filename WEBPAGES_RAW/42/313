 <h3>Email sent anonymously to: Richard Pattis (pattis@ics.uci.edu)</h3>
This is a small, simple to use tool for sending anonymous email to me.<br>
Please feel free to use it any time that you want to communicate with<br>
me anonymously.
<p>
Do <b>NOT ask questions</b> via anonymous email: I don't know who to<br>
reply to (and I don't want to broadcast a reply to the entire class).
<p>
Depending on the content, I might forward this note to the class<br>
discussion email list, with my reply.
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter your email in the text area below.
  <li>Press the <b>Submit</b> button.
