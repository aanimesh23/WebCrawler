<a name=UCI><p> &nbsp; <p> &nbsp; <p></a><h3>University of California, Irvine</h3>

<P>The University of California, Irvine (UCI) opened in 1965 with 116 faculty and 1,589 students. In the succeeding years, UCI has attained national and international distinction in its programs and faculty. The campus challenges its students both academically and personally and relies on the commitment, curiosity, imagination, and judgment of its faculty and students to assure its continued intellectual and cultural vitality.</P>
<P>Today, UCI has about 18,000 students and 1,400 faculty. The campus is planning to grow at approximately 5% per year, presenting many new opportunities for prospective faculty and students.</P>
<P>Two Nobel Prizes in 1995 for founding faculty <A target=_top href="http://chem.ps.uci.edu/zot/news/nobel.html">F. Sherwood Rowland</A> in Chemistry and <A target=_top href="http://www.ps.uci.edu/physics/nobelinfo.html">Frederick Reines</A> in Physics, helped to secure UCI's position among the leading American research universities. Membership in the American Association of Universities (AAU), a group of 60 of the most distinguished research institutions, is another indication of UCI's stature in the academic community. UC Irvine is the nation's eighth best public university, up from number nine last year, according to U.S. News & World Report's annual ranking of America's leading public and private universities. </P>
<P>UCI's research programs have a positive impact on both undergraduate and graduate education. Research is critical to graduate education because of the research-oriented nature of doctoral study. At the undergraduate level, students have access to a faculty made up of researchers at the forefront of their fields and also have opportunities to participate directly in faculty research projects.</P>

<a name="BS"><p> &nbsp; <p> &nbsp; <p></a><h3>Bachelor of Science in Information and Computer Science</h3>
</I></FONT><P>The B.S. in Information and Computer Science is a broader, more flexible program than is available at most universities. Because ICS is not part of another discipline such as Engineering, Business, Mathematics or Library Science, it does not focus on a single aspect of computing.</P>
<P>Students may select from six undergraduate specializations in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Systems Design, Implementation and Analysis of Algorithms, Information Systems, Networks and Distributed Systems, or Software Systems or combine the degree with a minor in a related field such as digital art, mathematics, or management.</P>
<P>An <A target=_top href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/prospective_students/honors/honseq.html>undergraduate honors program</A> allows accelerated students to be challenged by the faculty in small classes and individual study projects. </P>

<P>Because UCI is a research university, it offers a distinctive type of undergraduate education in which students can become involved with advanced subjects before texts are available on the subject. In a rapidly evolving field such as information and computer science, this is particularly important. ICS students can gain experience with topics such as machine-independent program representations and profile-based optimization of programs, ATM networks, information technology and public policy, embedded systems, intelligent agents, computational geometry, knowledge discovery in databases, and hardware software co-design. This advanced component of the UCI education is valuable whether you choose to continue your education in graduate school or pursue a high technology career.</P>
<P>The unique features of the ICS program have attracted students with the highest high school GPA and highest total SAT scores at UCI to this major. ICS students are well rounded: the average verbal SAT score of an ICS student is equivalent to that of English majors and the average math SAT scores is equal to that of Mathematics majors.</P>
<P>The <A target=_top href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~icsdb/facphone.html">ICS faculty</A> are dedicated to education as well as research and have authored more than 30 books on a wide range of topics in information and computer science. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sao/Books.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=195></P>
<P>Additional details are available on the <A target=_top href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sao/QA.html">Frequently asked questions of B.S. Applicants</A> web page. </P>
