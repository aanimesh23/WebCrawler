<H2>Preparing for the first hierarchical web example</H2>

<p>&nbsp; 
This example will show how to switch to a different web.  Each web has its
own collection of anchors and links.  You will be creating a new link
and connect new anchors to it.  These anchors will be on some new images.
<p>

<H3>Downloading Flight Images</H3>

<p>
There are a number of new images that will be used for this example.  They are
located at the following website:
<br>
<A HREF="download.html">Chimera 2.0 Turorial Download page</A>
</p>

<p> Download the following images:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> x-1.jpg

    <li> x-1_flying.gif
</ul>

<p> Place them anywhere you like in your account then display them 
using Jimage. </p>

<H3>What the Programs should have setup</H3>

<H4>Chimera Website</H4>

<p>
The Chimera Website should be running with the following setup:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> There should be two webs at the website: bill_web and flight_web
</ul>

<H4>Chimera Server</H4>

<p> The Chimera Server should be hooked up to the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li> The Chimera Website you have running.
    <li> The web: bill_web
</ul>

<H4>Jimage</H4>

<p> Jimage should be connected to the Chimera Server and have the following
images displayed:</p>

<ul>
    <li> bill.gif (There should be an anchor around bill.)
    <li> x-1.jpg
    <li> x-1_flying.gif
</ul>

<p> You are now ready to shift from bill_web to flight_web.
