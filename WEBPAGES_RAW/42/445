HTTP/1.1 is currently a Draft Standard in the IETF and little has 
changed for many months. Is this because applications are in catch up 
mode with the specification or is it silence before the XML storm 
replacing everything with angle brackets? What will the next move be? 
While performance is relatively easy to handle, the Achilles heel of 
HTTP is extensibility. Even though HTTP does a lot better compared to 
other protocols, the Web has changed many things including the way we 
think of protocols and how they are extended. Although HTTP/1.1 has a 
large set of features, many more useful extensions have been discussed 
but not deployed. At the same time, many features in the base protocol 
are really extensions that should not have been in the base protocol. 
This talk will be an overview of the current state of HTTP extension 
initiatives and a perspective of what can be done, both to application 
models and specifications, in order to get to the next level of the Web
evolution, without fragmenting the Web as an information space or 
letting HTTP get stuck in its current mold.

<strong>Biography:</strong>

Henrik Frystyk Nielsen is a Program Manager at Microsoft, 
Redmond, Washington. Since the beginning of 1994, Henrik has been 
working on mechanisms for dealing with distributed evolution and 
interoperability in the Web. He is a co-author of the HTTP/1.0 and 
HTTP/1.1 specifications as well as the HTTP Extension Framework. In 
1995, Henrik joined the initial W3C team at MIT where he served as 
the Activity Lead for HTTP, HTTP-NG and the Web Characterization effort
and as a key developer and maintainer of Libwww. Before that, he worked
on the initial World Wide Web project at CERN, where he participated in
the early design of HTTP/1.0 and worked on mechanisms for implementing 
Internet application protocols as hierarchical state machines. He holds
a degree as Master of Electrical Engineering in Telecommunications from
Aalborg University, Denmark.

In February, 1999, the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol was 
approved by the IETF, and has since been adopted in multiple servers 
and clients (such as Apache and Office 2000), providing remote 
collaborative authoring facilities for the Web. Since then, work on 
WebDAV has continued, with current efforts focusing on adding searching,
versioning, and configuration management. Beginning with a brief 
overview of WebDAV, the talk will mostly focus on "what's next." 
It will accomplish this by giving an overview of the DAV Searching 
and Locating (DASL) searching protocol, and the Delta-V versioning 
and configuration management protocol, both current efforts within 
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Each effort will be 
discussed with scenarios of use, goals, and highlights of the 
protocol's design.

<strong>Biography:</strong>

Jim Whitehead is the Chair of the WebDAV Working Group of 
the IETF, and a Ph.D. student in the Software research group at U.C. 
Irvine. Jim's research interests include remote collaborative authoring,
configuration management, hypertext versioning, open hypertext systems,
and software architecture. Jim was also an organizer of the recent 
Workshop on Internet Scale Technology (TWIST), focusing on Internet 
Scale Namespaces, held at U.C. Irvine. Prior to joining U.C. Irvine, 
Jim performed firmware development on air traffic and vessel traffic 
control systems at Raytheon.
