<h2>1 March 1996:<br>
Generating Triangulations without Repetitions<br>
Jason Cahill, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>

(Based on a paper by D. Avis and K. Fukuda, to appear in <i>
Discrete Applied Math</i> as "Reverse Search for Enumeration") 

<p>The reverse search technique has been recently introduced by the
authors for efficient enumeration of vertices of polyhedra and
arrangements. In this paper, the authors develop the idea in a
broader framework and show its applications to various problems in
operations research, combinatorics, and geometry.</p>

<p>In my talk, I will be discussing the motivations and details of
reverse search, followed by a discussion of how it can be applied
to the problem of generating all possible triangulations to a set
of <i>n</i> points in the plane.</p>
