<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This invited workshop aims to bring together researchers and designers
from academia and industry to discuss directions in the development
of high-performance, parallel, distributed, and multimedia processors and
systems.  The workshop invitees are computer architects and compiler,
operating system, and application experts. The main goal of the workshop
is to discuss future trends in the development of architecture and
software systems and to explore the assumptions made by the architects  
about software systems and by software writers about architecture.
The increased complexity in each of these areas calls for increased
interaction with researchers from all of the other disciplines to accurately
assess the potential directions and future trends in architecture and systems.
</p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The main themes of the workshop are software- and technology-driven and
constrained new architectures, compiler/architecture interaction and codesign,
and application requirements and characteristics.  Both numerical
and non-numerical applications, such as database, data mining,
Web- and Java-based, and (high-performance) embedded applications, are of interest.
In all cases a longer-term view and assessment of the future is of most interest.
</p>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This year's special focus is power-aware memory hierarchy.  Today both high-performance
and embedded processors and systems are concerned with power dissipation. Memory   
hierarchy is one of the major sources of on-chip and system power consumption. Until
recently this concern was primarily addressed via technology and circuit design.  An
important and interesting issue is whether (micro)architectural innovation and compiler
support can make significant contributions to reducing the power dissipation.
 
Workshop topics of  interest will deal with this issue and include but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Cache organizations that reduce power consumption
<li> Use of adaptive techniques in the hierarchy to reduce power consumption
<li> Power-performance trade-offs in the memory hierarchy
<li> Compiler techniques to manage the hierarchy to reduce power consumption
<li> Modeling, benchmarking, performance and power consumption evaluation 
<li> Other microarchtecture and compiler techniques for reducing power consumption 
</ul>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Additional workshop areas of interest include the perennial favorites below,
but preference will be given to submissions on the above-mentioned topics.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Processor design <br>
<li> Single-chip multiprocessors, multi-chip servers and large-scale multiprocessors <br>
<li> Memory technology and system organization <br>
<li> Systems On a Chip (SOC) <br>
<li> Architecture-compiler interaction and optimization <br>
<li> Applications and there performance 
</ul>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The workshop will consist of sessions combining individual presentations 
with discussion.  Presentations will be limited to ~20 min to provide sufficient
time for discussion.  An ideal presentation will concentrate on trends and future
directions in addition to recently obtained results.  Speculation is encouraged.
</p>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<b> Workshop participation is capped at 25 invitees.  </b> <br>
</p>


<H3><B> <a name="publ">  </a> </B></H3>
<b> Submission and Publication </b> </center>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
   The invitees wishing to make a presentation should submit
   an extended abstract, up to 3 pages, by 1/6/01.
   Submissions should be electronic in postscript  or pdf format.
   The abstracts will be reviewed and printed in the on-site proceedigns.
</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The final proceedings consisting of
full papers will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press after the meeting.
The papers will undergo an additional review process and be selected for
publication in the post-proceedings.  Papers will be due by ~April 1st 2001.
<br>
The following set of LaTex <A HREF="../ieee.macros">  macros </A> should be used
in preparing the final paper.
Additional publication instructions will be made available at a later date.

<li>
There are some non-stop flights from the mainland to Maui  Kahului airport and
even more flights to Honolulu.  In the latter case one has to catch a very short
commuter flight from Honolulu to Maui.   <br>
<br>
<li>
Registration fee: US$140.00.

Accomodations
<ul>
<li>
The workshop hotel is the <A HREF="http://www.princehotels.co.jp/maui-e/index.html">
Maui Prince </A>
where we have a group rate for IWIA ($160, it is high season).  <br>
<b> Reservations must be made by 1/4 </b> and will require a 2-night deposit (can be cancelled
without penalty up to two weeks before arrival).
Phone number for reservations is <b> (800)-321-6248 or (808)-874-1111 </b>.

meeting.
<li>
A number of condominiums (1 to 3 bedrooms) are available for those
