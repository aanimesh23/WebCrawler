<h1> <a name="Background"></a>Background and Definitions</h1>
  
<ul>
 <li> Our focus is targeted at the engineering of complex business capabilities 
or processes like software development <i>across their life cycle</i>.</li>
  <li> A <i>capability</i> represents the processes, organization staffing,
and information infrastructure, as well as their interrelationships, for
a recurring business activity that produces products or services.</li>
  <li> The <i>web of relationships</i> among the objects and attributes of
a product, process, organization, infrastructure, or total capability defines
its <i>architecture</i>.</li>

<h1> <a name="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h1>
  
<ul>
 <li> Business process engineering is a dynamic team-based endeavor that
can lead to mature processes through process prototyping, incremental development, 
iterative refinement, and the reengineering of ad hoc process task instances 
and models.</li>
  <li> Process/capability engineering may be most likely to succeed when
focused on <i>high frequency</i> or <i>short cycle-time</i> processes.</li>
  <li> New techniques for rapid process design, trade-off analysis, and <i>
customization</i> are needed.</li>
  <li> There are "pathological" business processes that are resistant to
systematic (re)engineering, and thus should be avoided. These processes are
characterized by lack of frequent repetition, ad-hoc process structure or
flow, highly creative activities, infrequent but long-duration cycle times,
and processes whose formalization overwhelms their simplicity.</li>
