<H1>A Note on Technical Report Availability</H1>

Some of my papers have been published as ICS departmental
technical reports.  Unfortunately, the ICS department technical report
web server is never up.  If the report you want is not already available
from <a href="/~eppstein/pubs/">my publications page</a>,
<A HREF="mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu">send me
an email</A> with the title and I'll try to dig up a copy for you.
