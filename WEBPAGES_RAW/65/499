<p>
Cuckoo hashing holds great potential as a high-performance hashing
scheme for real applications. Up to this point, the greatest drawback
of cuckoo hashing appears to be that there is a polynomially small but
practically significant probability that a failure occurs during the
insertion of an item, requiring an expensive rehashing of all items in
the table. In this paper, we show that this failure probability can be
dramatically reduced by the addition of a very small constant-sized
stash. We demonstrate both analytically and through simulations that
stashes of size equivalent to only three or four items yield
tremendous improvements, enhancing cuckoo hashing's practical
viability in both hardware and software. Our analysis naturally
extends previous analyses of multiple cuckoo hashing variants, and the
approach may prove useful in further related schemes.
