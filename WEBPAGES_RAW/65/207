<p>

The Southern California SPIN is a community of software practitioners and
researchers that gathers monthly to investigate and discuss topics of interest
in the area of Software Process.</p>


<h3> Mission Statement</h3> 
<blockquote>
The Southern California SPIN is a leadership forum for the free and 
open exchange of software process improvement experiences and practical ideas.
We promote achieving higher levels of process maturity,
software quality and mutual respect.  Our goal is to enhance skills
and support technology transition through an active
program of networking, publications, recognition of
excellence, and mutual support.
</blockquote>

<P>

<h3> SPIN Meetings </h3>
SPIN meetings are held on the UC Irvine campus from 9:00 am to 12 noon on the 
last Friday of every month (except holidays) and have an average attendance of
60. 

<P>

Each meeting addresses a specific topic; previous topics have included 
process definition, the Capability Maturity Model, software process 
technology, metrics, software testing, risk management, and ISO 9000.
A typical meeting format consists of presentations by practitioners and experts
on a topic followed by discussion. 

<p>

Special formats, such as interactive workshops and "group thinks" have
generated high interest and enhanced the learning experience. The 
Southern California SPIN experimented with a very unique format: a 
dramatic reading (or reader's theatre).  <em>The Case of the Killer 
Robot</em>, based on a series of articles by Richard Epstein, was dramatized
for the SPIN and received rave reviews.
<p>

SPIN attendees find community building and 
networking invaluable added benefits.

<P>

<h3> Meeting Flyers </h3>
Flyers providing details on the meeting topic as well as logistical
information are circulated approximately two weeks prior to the meeting.

Meeting flyers are also available on the

<h3><A NAME="irus_to_spin_ster">SPIN Steering Committee</A></h3>
<p>
SPIN meetings are planned and organized by the SPIN Steering Committee, which 
meets monthly immediately after the SPIN meetings. 
The SPIN Steering Committee consists of volunteers who meet
immediately after the SPIN meeting to choose meeting topics, plan future 
meetings, discuss areas of concern, and provide strategic direction.
<p>
The Steering Committee has developed a SPIN
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/spin/spin_charter.html"> Charter</A> which 
includes various roles to be fulfilled by the committee members. An
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/spin/spin_st_com_election_proc.html">
Election Procedure</a> defines the nomination and voting procedure.

<p>
The Steering Committee has also developed a 
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/spin/spin_coord_timetable.html">
Meeting Coordinator's Responsibilities and Timetable</A> and set of
<A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/spin/spin_speaker_guidelines.html">
Speaker Guidelines</A> to assist the meeting coordinators and speakers.
