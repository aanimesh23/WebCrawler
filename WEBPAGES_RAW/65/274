You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
 refer to them while downloading and installing Python.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely before performing the action that it
 describes.
<p>
This document shows downloading and installing Python 3.4.1 on Mac OS X 10.6
  and  later.
You should download and install the latest Python.<p>

<hr align="left" width="100%">
<h2>Python: Version 3.4.1</h2>
<p>

The Python download requires about 18 MB of disk space; keep it on your machine,
 in case you need to re-install Python.
When installed, Python requires about an additional 90 MB of disk space.

     are on a slow internet connection (it took me about 10 seconds over a
     cable modem).

<p>
<li>Click <b>Install</b>.
   <p>
   The previous pop-window will reappear, displaying the message<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Install Python 3.4.1</b><p>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Please wait while the Installer installs
          Python 3.4.1. This may take<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;several minutes.</b>
   <p>
   During installation, it will show the various operations it is
     performing and a progress bar for each one.

 the window on the first line is the text <b>Python 3.4.1 ...</b>.
<p>
Click the red (terminate) icon to terminate this pop-up window.
<p>
You should keep the file <b>python-3.4.1-macosx10.6.dmg</b> somewhere on your
  computer in case you need to reinstall Python (not likely necessary).
<p>
You may now follow the instructions to download and install Java (it is already
  installed on most Macs; to update Java on your Mac, go to
  <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_java_update.xml">
  Java SE Development Kit 7 Downloads</a>, <b>Accept</b> the license agreement,
  and then download <b>dk-7u72-macosx-x64.dmg</b> and install it)
  and then download/install the Eclipse IDE (for Python).
