this  is broken down between deliverables, a team Web page, and presentations. The <strong>approximately</strong> remaining  20% will be divided among individual course logs, teamwork, individual leadership  demonstrated, and the final. These are guidelines intended to help students  plan their work in this course. However, the instructor does reserve the<br>  right to make changes in these evaluation criteria.A critcal aspect of success,  however, and thus of assessment, is an effectively functioning team. Just because  a team's code &quot;works&quot; at the end of the quarter does not mean that  they have earned an A. If the team did a poor job on the requirements and design,  for instance, their grade would be much lower, despite &quot;working&quot; code.  Put another way, if your team has to pull an all-nighter to get a working system,  in all likelihood you will not receive the grade you want. <h4> Deliverables</h4>The  project nominally consists of five major assignments. The relativeweighting of each deliverable, intended to provide you with some guidance asto how much effort should be devoted to these tasks, and how much importanceI ascribe to them, is indicated in the table below along with the due date, orapproximate due date. The on-line versions of the assignments may still be underconstruction (watch the&quot;what's new&quot;section to see when they are available). <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<center>  <table BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 >    <tr ALIGN=LEFT>      <td width="199"><b>Deliverable/Schedule Item</b></td>      <td width="53"><b>Weight&nbsp;</b></td>      <td width="506" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><b>Description </b></td>      <td width="262"><b>Due Date (subject to change) </b></td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td><div align="left">Individual Web Page</div></td>      <td>.</td>      <td>&nbsp;</td>      <td>January 13th</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td><div align="left">        <ul>          Teams Designated        </ul>      </div></td>      <td>.</td>      <td>January 9th</td>      <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td><div align="left">        <ul>          Projects Selected/Assigned        </ul>      </div></td>      <td>.</td>      <td>January 9th</td>      <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td><div align="left">Team Web Page</div></td>      <td>.</td>      <td>&nbsp;</td>      <td>January 15th</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td><div align="left">Prospectus and Plan&nbsp;</div></td>      <td><center>        10&nbsp;      </center></td>      <td><a href="prospectus.html">Prospectus&nbsp;</a></td>      <td>January 20th</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td><div align="left">        <ul>          Prospectus Reviews        </ul>      </div></td>      <td>.</td>      <td>week 3</td>      <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td><div align="left">Requirements Specification</div></td>      <td><center>        15&nbsp;      </center></td>      <td><a href="requirements.html">Requirements</a></td>      <td>January 29th</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td><div align="left">        <ul>          Requirements Reviews        </ul>      </div></td>      <td>.</td>      <td>week 4</td>      <td>January 27th and/or 29th</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td><div align="left">Architecture/Module Specifications&nbsp;</div></td>      <td><center>        20&nbsp;      </center></td>      <td><a href="design.html">Architecture/Design</a></td>      <td>February 12th</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td><div align="left">        <ul>          Design Reviews        </ul>      </div></td>      <td>.</td>      <td>Week 6</td>      <td>February 12th</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td><div align="left">Implementation&nbsp;</div></td>      <td><center>        20&nbsp;      </center></td>      <td><a href="implementation.html">Implementation/1st demonstration </a></td>      <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td><div align="left">        <ul>          Code Reviews/Demos        </ul>      </div></td>      <td>.</td>      <td>week 9</td>      <td>March 5th</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td><div align="left">Testing/Test Documentation</div></td>      <td><div align="center">15&nbsp;</div></td>      <td><a href="integration-test.html">Implementation/2nd demonstration/Quality          Assurance Report</a> </td>      <td>March 12th</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td><div align="left">        <ul>          Demonstrations        </ul>      </div></td>      <td>.</td>      <td>week 10 + finals week (TBD) </td>      <td>&nbsp;</td>    </tr>  </table></center><p> Variations on this schedule may be made to accommodate the particular needs  of a given project or a given team. Also, note that a team's grade for a phase  is a function not only of the document/specification developed but also of  any associated test plan and any reviews conducted in class, with the instructor,  with the TA, or with the customer.<p>Have questions about your intellectual property rights (IPR)? Take a look  at the <a href="http://www.ota.uci.edu/html/body_patent_policy.html">UC's  view of the subject</a> also see<a href="http://www.ucop.edu/ott/genresources/pat-pol_97.html"> http://www.ucop.edu/ott/genresources/pat-pol_97.html</a><h4> Deliverable Due Dates</h4><p> Specific due dates/times will be indicated for each assignment. NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS  WILL BE ACCEPTED. This applies to your final system and all intermediate projects.  Since you are working in this class as part of team, it is the <strong>team's</strong> responsibility  to ensure that assignments are turned in on time. Normal excuses for late assignments,  such as illness, do not apply in a team setting (unless of course everyone  on the team is ill :-)  <h4> Deliverable Reviews</h4>Each deliverable will be reviewed, some reviews will be conducted before thewhole class.<p> Your customer should be invited to your team's Prospectus and Requirements  review as well as your demonstration (and, possibly even your design and code  reviews depending on the nature of your customer).&nbsp; The review is your  team's chance to inform as well as obtain feedback and ideas from all relevant  parties; your document will be reviewed at this time by course staff and clients  as well as the rest of the class.&nbsp; This review is formal, however, and  each team should have presented and negotiated both relevant documents to the  customer prior to the review (if you haven't, it may be unpleasantly obvious  by the interactions at this time).  <h3> Document Requirements</h3><P> All the documents associated with the above listed phases are integral parts  of systematic software development. Their continued, up-to-date existence is  necessary for successful system development. <b>Do not delete</b> documents  after they have been turned in. They must reside permanently on your team's  website.<P> All deliverable documents, with the exception of performance appraisals as  discussed below, must be prepared on-line and be available as part of your  project home page either as either HTML or .pdf files. NO MS Word files. In  general, the following should be observed.<DL>  <dl>    <dt><strong>Cover "page".</strong></dt>  </dl>  <dd> Every deliverable shall have identifying information giving:  </dd></dl><DL><DL><DD> Project title    <DT>        <DD> Development phase and deliverable    <DT>        <DD> Date    <DT>        <DD> Team name/number    <DT>        <DD> Team members    <DT>        <DD> Phase manager    <DT>        <DD>        <DT>        <DD> Files and locations (href's)  </DL>  <br>  <dl>    <DT> <strong>Table of Contents. </strong>    <DD> Every deliverable shall include a table of contents    <DT><strong>Specification</strong>.    <DD> The system specification (requirements, architecture, module specs,      code) for each deliverable shall correspond in form and content to the      outline provided for that phase. Sections that are not necessary for this      project shall be marked ``N/A''.    <DT><strong>Agendas and Minutes. </strong>        <DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied by agendas for and minutes          of team meetings held during the associated period of time.     <DT><strong>Performance Appraisals</strong>.        <DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied by <a href="Perf_Appraisal.doc">performance            appraisals.</a> Performance appraisals shall NOT be maintained as            part of the project's web page.      <DT><strong>Project WebPage</strong>.        <DD> The project deliverables, except for the performance appraisals,          shall be maintained in a project homepage.    </DL></dl><h3>``Fixed up'' Deliverables</h3><P> For all deliverables, except for the last and except for the &quot;Agendas  and Minutes&quot;  section, you will also have the opportunity to ``fix it'' based on its evaluation.  You may submit an improved version of a deliverable one week after that deliverable  has been graded and receive up to 50% of the points deducted on the initial  version. The purpose of this exercise is for you to both learn how to use the  techniques and so that you do not implement something from a bad design or  specification. You should keep the same responsibilities for the improvement  phase but assign new responsibilities for the next phase.    <H3> Course Log</H3><P> During your career you will need to keep track of how you spend your time  either for you employer or to improve your own productivity. Throughout this  course, you will practice doing this by keeping a course log recording the  time you spend on all activities related to this course. At the beginning of  each week you must submit the previous week's log to the TA. A sheet showing  what should be on the log <a href="logform.html">is  available</a>. The first log you submit will cover <em>Week  Two</em>;  it will be submitted  at the beginning of <em>Week Three</em>.<p> Keep a copy of your logs: you will need them at the end of the quarter for  the final review.    <P> Each entry records the date and amount of time spent, type of entry, and  text describing the entry. An entry is one of three types:<UL>  <LI> A <i>description</i> records an activity;  <LI> An <i>explanation</i> says why something happened;  <LI> A <i>prescription</i> is a plan for something to do later.</UL><p> Most entries will be of the first type, but occasionally you should reflect  and think about what is going on. The time entry applies for descriptions of  activities and records the amount of time spent in hours, to the nearest quarter  hour.  <P> You will be marked down only for failing to submit logs each week, <strong>giving  too little detail</strong>, or failing to keep track of time spent.  <P> You are especially encouraged to keep track of the kinds of errors you make  and the amount of time they consume. The purpose of recording these errors  is so that you develop a better understanding of the kinds of mistakes you  typically make. With that understanding you can improve your performance in  the future, by paying extra attention to those areas in which you've had problems  in the past.<h2><font color="#990000">Summary of what you turn in, and when:</font></h2><ol>  <li><font color="#990000">Weekly, by individual, using a dropbox: course log      for preceding week.</font></li>  <li><font color="#990000">Per deliverable, by team, on website: deliverable      documents.</font></li>  <li><font color="#990000">Per deliverable, by team, on paper, performance appraisals.      Exception: <strong>not</strong> required for the Prospectus.</font></li>  <li><font color="#990000">End of quarter, by individual, on paper: collection      of the course logs for the quarter.</font></li>  <li><font color="#990000">End of quarter, by individual, on paper, &quot;peer      apportionment of credit&quot;</font></li></ol><hr><h3> Team Composition, Activities, and Peer Apportionment of Credit</h3><h4>How will teams be composed? </h4>Each team will have 3 to 5 people. I will attempt to balance a team's aggregateexpertise with the needs of a particular project. I will also attempt to accommodatesome personal preferences for teammates. The <a href="survey.html">course surveyform</a>, which you will turn in on the first week of class, is a key instrumentin assigning the teams. In the end however, I make all the assignments, bothof team composition and of project.<H3>&nbsp;</H3><P>The danger most students perceive in working on projects with other students  is being saddled with (what they think is) a "non-producer". This is particularly  true when you don't get to choose all your teammates (the situation here).  Many factors dictate the use of a multi-person project for this course. You  will not, after all, be able to choose your workmates in the future. One thing  we'll discuss in the class is how to fix dysfunctional teams. Nonetheless,  to alleviate your concerns and to grade you appropriately, at the end of the  term project you will be asked to divide 100 points among the members of your  project team, excluding yourself, corresponding to how you believe they contributed  to the project as a whole (or on a phase-by-phase basis if you wish). In addition,  each team member will be appraised for each phase. This ``peer apportionment  of credit'' will be used to help determine appropriate individual grades for  the project component.  <H3> Team Organization</H3><P> There are several obvious dangers to group work that can be circumvented.  Ensure that there is adequate coordination among the team members. Know each  other's login names for electronic mail. Know each other's phone numbers. Meet <b>at  least twice per week</b> (outside of class lecture) at the same, pre-determined  time each week (so as to avoid confusion). The Discussion Section is designed  to guarantee that such meetings are possible for everyone. You are strongly  urged to use that time slot.  <p> Have a contingency plan for submitting a document on time even if the responsible  manager becomes unavailable.  <p> You are <b>strongly</b> advised to consult weekly with the instructor/TA  about your progress, problems, questions, etc.  <h3> Meetings</h3><P> Meetings are an important part of a team project. A successful meeting requires  that the meeting have a definite purpose and associated agenda (these are the  responsibility of the phase manager) and that all decisions be recorded in  minutes (the responsibility of the phase clerical person).<P> The purpose of minutes is to record decisions made and to be available for  updating any team member who misses a meeting. Each deliverable must be accompanied  by agendas and minutes for the team meetings held during the associated period  of time. I.e., keep the agenda, and the minutes, on-line as part of your project  web page. The minutes should outline<OL>  <LI> Date, time began, time ended   <LI>agenda for the meeting  <LI> team members present and reason for any member's absence  <LI> major design decisions discussed  <LI> task assignments made (i.e. action items)   <LI>open issues  <LI>questions to be asked and plan for getting them answered   <LI> future meetings scheduled  <LI>topics for next meeting. </OL><hr width="100%"><h3><font face="Verdana"><aname="policies"></a>Policies</font></h3><p><strong>What's the Drop/Add policy? </strong>Since Informatics 117 has a strong  team project orientation, it is essential that the drop/add process be terminated  early.
