<OL>
<P><LI>Suppose we have defined two Turing machines, M1 and M2, both of 
which take input strings composed of the characters "0" and "1".
M1 accepts strings that match the regular expression 0*1* and that have 
equal numbers of zeros and ones; for instance, it accepts the empty string, 
and the strings 01, 0011, 000111, and 00001111.  M2 accepts any string 
which is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards);
for instance, it accepts the empty string, and the strings 0, 1, 00, 11,
000, 010, 101, 111, 0000, 0110, 1001, and 1111.

<P>(a) Show how to translate strings of zeros and ones with a finite state 
machine, so that M1 accepts a string s if and only if M2 accepts the 
translation of s.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="RED"><I>
Answer: There are many possible translations; here's a particularly
simple one.  Convert "0" to "01" and "1" to "10".  But if you ever see a
"0" after the first "1", convert it and any following characters to a
"1".

<P>(b) Does the existence of this translation show that M1 can simulate 
M2, or that M2 can simulate M1?

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="RED"><I>
Answer: that M2 can simulate M1.

<P>(c) Do you think you can find a similar translation in the opposite 
direction, so that M2 accepts a string s if and only if M1 accepts the 
translation of s?  Why or why not?

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="RED"><I>
Answer: I don't believe a translation in the other direction exists,
because the finite state machine doing the translation could not know
where the middle of the string is.

<P>For example suppose the machine were going to translate the input
"01100110".  The first four characters "0110" are a palindrome, and the
maching doing the translation can not know (after seeing these palindromes)
that there are more characters left.  So, their
translation should be of the form 0<sup>i</sup>1<sup>i</sup>
accepted by M1.  Then the first five characters "01100" are not a palindrome,
and the machine doing the translation should add more characters to
the previously output string so it is no longer of the form
0<sup>i</sup>1<sup>i</sup>.  But once it has done that, then no matter
what else is added, it is stuck with
a string that will never be accepted by M1, even though the whole string
"01100110" is a palindrome.

<P>(d) If the reverse translation does not exist, what would that imply 
about the possibility that M1 or M2 might be universal?

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="RED"><I>
M1 is not a universal Turing machine, because there exist machines
(namely M2) which it can't simulate.

<P>We would need more information to know whether M2 is universal,
the translations considered so far aren't enough to tell one way or the other.
(It turns out that M2 is not universal, but proving this would be beyond
the scope of this course.)

<P><LI>For each of the following sets of pairs of strings,
either solve the Post correspondence problem or explain why no solution 
exists.  (Recall that a solution is a sequence of 
pairs such that the concatenation of the top strings in the pairs is equal 
to the concatenation of the bottom strings.)

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="RED"><I>
Answer: There is no solution.  If there were, the first pair in the
solution would have to be (10,1) because no other pair has matching
first characters.  But after using that pair, the top string
ends with one more character (a zero) than the bottom.
Only one pair, (10,01), allows that zero to be matched, but it leaves
another zero unmatched again.  So, at each step you're forced
to add a pair (10,01), and you can never finish this process and find a
finite solution.

Answer: 1110 1110 1110 1110 1 1 1 = 1 1 1 0111 0111 0111.

<P>This one is pretty easy, but it shows that even when the number of
pairs in an example of the Post correspondence problem is small
(here there are only two pairs), the length of a solution can be quite large.
