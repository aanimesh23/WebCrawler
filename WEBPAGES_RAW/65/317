<H2>Hyperwebs Tab</H2>

<p>The display shows a hierarchy of folder and document icons that represent the hyperwebs on this website. A folder icon denotes a node that has children while a document icon represents a node with no children. Each node is a complete hyperweb of anchors and links. A child hyperweb also has access to the anchors and links stored in its ancestors.</p>

<p>The hostname of the website is the root node of the hierarchy. All hyperwebs share this node as their common ancestor (which is the only node which does not have a set of anchors and links associated with it). This arrangement enables a mapping between a hyperweb and a URL. For instance, a leaf node <b>web1.1</b> whose parent is <b>web1</b> whose parent is the root node has an associated URL of &lt;http://host.domain.com/web1/web1.1/&gt;. A user can use this URL to browse the web in a Web browser provided that the host's Web server is properly configured.</p>

<H3>Displaying the hyperweb hierarchy</H3>

<p>To display the children of a node, double click on it. Double click again to hide the node's children.</p>

<H3>Variations between Look-and-Feels</H3>

<ul>
<li>The Metal Look-and-Feel is sensitive to the location of the mouse with respect to double clicks. The cursor must be exactly above the folder in order to work correctly.
<li>The CDE/Motif Look-and-Feel requires only a click on the plus symbol to open the folder, and a click on the minus symbol to close it.
</ul>
