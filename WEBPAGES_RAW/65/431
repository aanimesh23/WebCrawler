Abstract: We introduce a class of "inverse parametric optimization"
problems, in which one is given both a parametric optimization
problem and a desired optimal solution; the task is to determine
parameter values that lead to the given solution. We describe
algorithms for solving such problems for minimum spanning trees,
shortest paths, and other "optimal subgraph" problems, and discuss
applications in multicast routing, vehicle path planning, resource
allocation, and board game programming.
