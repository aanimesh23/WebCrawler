<P><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=6><B>Pair Programming Guidelines</B></FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Two heads are better than one, according to
an old saying.  This even applies to writing programs:  A pair of programmers
(working as described here) nearly always beats the stereotypical solitary
loner.  The pair produces more high-quality code in less time, by far more
than two-to-one.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>In pair programming, two programmers share
one computer.  One is the &quot;driver,&quot; who controls the keyboard
and mouse.  The other is the &quot;navigator,&quot; who observes, asks questions,
suggests solutions, and thinks about slightly longer-term strategies.  The
two programmers switch roles frequently</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">&mdash;</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>every 15 minutes would be a good
interval for us, though that&#39;s flexible.  Even the activities of the
driver and navigator are flexible (except for who does the typing); the
goal is to work collaboratively, each partner assisting the other as needed,
to produce the best joint result possible.  It is not pair programming if
one person does all the work or if the partners just split up the work and
each does half independently.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>That&#39;s the basic idea:  Spend your time in the scheduled labs working with your partner,
one of you as driver and the other as navigator, switching regularly.  You
may need to arrange other times to meet, beyond the scheduled lab sections.
 We expect everyone to be as flexible and professional as possible in arranging
those times as necessary; if your schedule is highly constrained, explore
possible outside meeting times with your prospective partners before you commit to the partnership.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>You may enjoy reading this paper about pair
programming:  <A HREF="http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=332848&type=pdf&coll=ACM&dl=ACM&CFID=12916017&CFTOKEN=16268370">All I Really Need to Know About Pair Programming I Learned in Kindergarten</A>,
by Laurie A. Williams and Robert R. Kessler (<I>Communications of the ACM,</I>
May 2000).  <A HREF="http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/Kindergarten.PDF">[Alternate link]</A>
</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>What about individual differences?  </B>People
new to pair programming often ask what happens if the members of the pair
have different abilities.  Actually, that is true of any pair of people
in the world, probably even including identical twins.  The differences
may be great or small, one member may have more strengths than the other,
but this is exactly like most real-world working situations.  Part of accomplishing
a task is to get the most out of each member and make each member stronger
and more productive on subsequent tasks.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>A clearly stronger partner may feel frustrated
or slowed down by the other partner, but the stronger partner still benefits
from the teamwork in many ways: The other partner&#39;s requests for clarification
often point out flaws in the approach or solution, the teamwork skills gained
have great value in the job market, and the exercise of providing a clear
explanation solidifies and deepens the explainer&#39;s own understanding.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>The less strong partner may feel that questions
hold the other partner back or that there is no benefit to participating
actively, but pair programming studies show that paired work is consistently
better than work the stronger partner does individually.  It is part of
each partner&#39;s job to understand the whole task; that means asking questions
when necessary and answering them when possible.</FONT></P>
<P><font size="4" face="Garamond">You will choose a different partner for every assignment, so your partners' skill levels are certain to vary from week to week. Still, when you have a choice, you should try to pick a partner whose skill level is close to your own. This won't always be possible, and it's sometimes hard to compare skill levels at all, but we find that pairs are most productive when the partners are at about the same level. </font></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>How does this affect my grade?</B>  Of
course the expectation in ICS H21 is that everyone will get a grade in the
A range.  Participation in pair programming won&#39;t be the cause of any
low grades.  (Failure to participate fully and cooperatively, on the other
hand, could be a problem.)</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>On assignments that specify pair programming,
each pair will submit one solution, marked with both partners&#39; names.
 (For electronic submissions via Checkmate, just one member of the pair
should submit the solution, which should still contain both partners&#39;
names; we&#39;ll keep track of who&#39;s in what pair, so long as you keep
us informed of your pairings in the first place.)  Each pair will receive
a single score on the assignment.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>Also, for each paired assignment, each student
individually will submit a brief partner evaluation form, administered electronically,
which will ask these questions:  Did your partner come to the scheduled
meetings on time and ready to work?  Did your partner read the assignment
and preparatory materials before coming to the scheduled meetings, showing up wither with specific questions or ready to contribute?  Did
your partner cooperatively follow the pair programming model (rotating roles
of driver and navigator, questioning and making observations as the navigator)?
 Did your partner contribute fully, fairly, and actively, to the best of his or her ability, to the completion
of the lab assignment?  Was your partner&#39;s participation professional
and cooperative overall?  </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT size="4" FACE="Garamond">Filling out the evaluation is required of each
student for each assignment; forgetting the evaluation won't help your grade. We haven&#39;t yet determined exactly how the evaluations will be factored
into assignment scores or grades:  We hope and expect that everyone&#39;s
responses will be positive, in which case it won&#39;t make much difference,
but we will be looking for recurring negative evaluations.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4>It may be instructive to read a selection
of students&#39; <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/evalcomments.html">partner evaluation comments</A>
from a previous course; they give a picture of what good partnerships are
like (and a few disasters, too).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><B>Additional information:</B>  Pair programming
is one aspect of the trendily-named programming methodology Extreme Programming.
 A search for &quot;pair programming&quot; or &quot;extreme programming&quot;
on the Web will yield many references.</FONT></P>
