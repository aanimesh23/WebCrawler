<H3> A Quick Bio </H3>
<span>
I am a Third-year Ph.D student at the University of California, Irvine working in applied cryptography under <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~gts">Gene Tsudik</a>. <br>
My current research deals with Usable Security, particularly the prevalence of user errors in the presence of adversarial noise across multiple sensory inputs. I am also developing a technique for passive deauthentication based
on biometric data. 
In the long term, I am interested in the development and evaluation of usable security protocols for Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
In the past I have worked on the development and deployment of an accessible, coercion resistant voting machine.
