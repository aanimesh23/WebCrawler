"<b>A Component- and Message-Based Architectural Style for GUI
Software</b>"</A>, by Richard N. Taylor, Nenad Medvidovic, Kenneth M. Anderson,

<H2> Abstract </H2>

While a large fraction of application code is devoted to graphical user 
interface (GUI) functions, support for reuse in this domain has largely 
been confined to the creation of GUI toolkits <i>widgets</i>. We present 
a novel architectural style directed at supporting larger grain reuse 
and flexible system composition. Moreover, the style supports design of 
distributed, concurrent applications. Asynchronous notification messages and 
asynchronous request messages are the sole basis for inter-component 
communication. A key aspect of the style is that components are not built 
with any dependencies on what typically would be considered lower-level 
components, such as user interface toolkits. Indeed, all components are 
oblivious to the existence of any components to which notification messages 
are sent. While our focus has been on applications involving graphical 
user interfaces, the style has the potential for broader applicability. 
Several trial applications using the style are described
