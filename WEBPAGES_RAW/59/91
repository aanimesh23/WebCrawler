<H1>Parking Information and Directions to the UC Irvine <br>
University Club<br>
including <i>Purchasing a Parking Permit</i></H1>

If this is your first visit to the UCI campus, you should be aware that
it is not easy to figure out the campus. We recommend that you get a 
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/directions/directions_uci.html">
map</a>
with building numbers.
<p> 
<font color=red><b>Please note</b></font color> that the University Club 
(UClub) does have its own parking lot (18B). You do not need a permit to 
park in this lot. <font color=red><b>However</b></font color>, this lot 
is small and fills up quickly. In addition, you can only park there for 
the duration of the meeting. If you have other plans on campus, you will 
have to move your car (they <b> will</b> ticket). 

<p>
The directions below will take you to the UClub parking lot (18B). If 
it is full, you will need to drive to an automated permit dispenser, 
purchase a permit, park in lot 18C, and walk to the UClub.
<p>
 
Plan to arrive at least 30 minutes early to ensure you get a parking
space, and to allow time to purchase a permit and to walk to the 
University Club.
