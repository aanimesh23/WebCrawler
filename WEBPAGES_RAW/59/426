Title: Online Facility Location,
by Adam Meyerson. 
IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) 2001.
<br>
Speaker: Matthew Ba Nguyen</h2>

<p>
Abstract:
The author considers the online version of the facility location problem
where demand points arrive one at a time and facilities must be opened to
mantain them.  The author presents an O(log n)-competitive algorithm and
shows that no algorithm can be O(1)-competitive.  Also, an
O(1)-competitive algorithm is presented when the power of the adversary is
reduced such that each demand point arrives in a random order.
