<h1>   Cryptographic and Physical Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems for
Solutions of Sudoku Puzzles.
</h1>
<h2> By Ronen Gradwohl, Moni Naor, Benny Pinkas, Guy Rothblum.</h2>
<h2> Appeared in TOCS 2009</h2>
<h2> Presented by Rishab Nityanand, UC Irvine</h2>


<p>

Talk Overview:
I decided to select a topic for my presentation which continues from my
two presentations last year (Sudoku as a SAT problem, Overview of ZK
Proofs). I will put both of them together and talk about this paper which
presents cryptographic and physical ZK protocols to prove that Alice has a
solution to a Sudoku puzzle. I will explain 2 of the cryptographic
protocols and 2 of the physical protocols from the paper.
