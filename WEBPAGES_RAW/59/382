      <p>Many problems will require a good bit of interpretation. You will find that   often the problem gives you more information than you need, or not enough. This   is intentional. Hence, I expect you to struggle with some problems. There   is no one correct answer to many problems. An answer is almost never sufficient   without an explanation.&nbsp; This is particularly true if you want to convince me   that your approach, although it may be different than mine, is reasonable. Any   assumptions you have made should be stated clearly at the top of the solution.   On a small scale, this makes the problems much more representative (than most   textbook problems) of problems you will encounter in real life.</p>
      <p>You are welcome to come ask me questions about how to approach a problem. You   may discuss how to approach a problem with as many other students as you like,   but <strong>you must work out the solution by yourself</strong>. Identical solutions presented by   different students will be considered cheating if it is clear that collaboration   proceeded beyond discussing the approach to the problem.<BR>
          <BR>
          <strong>Problem sets should be completed on paper and turned in at the beginning of lecture. </strong>Explain what you   are doing in English. An answer or some arithmetic, without an explanation in   English, will often not receive full credit. This will also help us give you   partial credit when you do something wrong early in the problem upon which later   results depend. Make sure you answer all questions asked. Often problems   include multiple questions. <strong>Please mark final answers in boxes to make grading   easier.</strong><BR>
          <BR>
        We will make available solution sets <a href="../slides/index.html">online</a> when   each problem set is graded and returned. You are encouraged to obtain these   solutions and to compare them to your solution.</p>
