"<B>Experiences with an Object Manager for a Process-Centered
Environment</B>"</A>, by Dennis Heimbigner, in <I>Proceedings of the
18th VLDB Conference</I>, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, August
23-27, 1992.

<H2> Abstract </H2>

Process-centered software engineering environments, such as Arcadia,
impose a variety of requirements on database technology that to date
have not been well supported by available object-oriented databases.
Some of these requirements  multi-language access and sharing,
support for independent relations, and support for triggers.  Triton
is an object-oriented database management system designed to support
the Arcadia software engineering environment.  It can be used as a
general purpose DBMS, although it has specialized features to support
the software process capabilities in Arcadia in the form of the APPL/A
language.  Triton was developed as prototype to explore the
requirements for software environments and to provide prototypical
solutions.  By making these requirements known it is hoped that better
solutions will eventually be provided by the database community.
