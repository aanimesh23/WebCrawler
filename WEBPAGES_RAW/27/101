<H2> Abstract </H2>

The focus of the Chiron user interface system is on user interface and 
application architectures.
It takes a software engineering approach to user interface development
by creating interface layers which are resilient to change.  In
particular, two main goals have been the separation of an application
from its user interface code, as well as a separation between the
user interface code and the underlying toolkit substrates.
Chiron supports the construction of graphical user interfaces that
provide multiple coordinated views of application objects and
allows flexible restructuring of the configuration of those views.

This manual is intended as an aid to Chiron user interface builders.
Although a brief description of the Chiron architecture is provided,
this manual does not thoroughly discuss the design, rational, and philosophy
behind Chiron.
