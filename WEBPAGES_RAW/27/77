<H1> Overview, Prerequisites, and Frequently Asked Questions </H1>

<h3>
UCI Catalog Description:</h3>

<blockquote>
Specification, design, construction, testing, and documentation of a
complete software system using concepts learned in ICS 52, 121, and
141.  Special emphasis on the need for and use of teamwork, careful
planning, and other techniques for working with large systems.  
</blockquote>

<p>This course will emphasize techniques and notations essential to creating
software systems based on the principles discussed in ICS 121: well-understood
requirements, usability and user interface design, architectural design
and module specification, well-planned testing, effective oral and written
communication of concepts, proper programming style, group coordination,
product documentation and software process.

<p>All students are expected to attend all lecture and discussion sections.
In general, there will not be much lecturing in the class. Instead, class
time will be highly interactive, and all students are expected to participate.
About half of the time will be spent performing reviews of the artifacts
developed. These reviews will take up all lecture and discussion periods
the week following the due date for each deliverable.

<h3>
Prerequisites:</h3>  ICS 51 with a grade of C or better;  ICS 121 and 141;
Mathematics 2A-B-C.  

<h3>  Is the Discussion Section required? </h3>

<p>
Yes!  The discussion section is essential for two reasons:
<ol>
<li>  You will need to meet with your teammates REGULARLY.  The best correlation with failure
that I've seen in this class over the past decade has been teams which were unable or unwilling
to establish a regular meeting schedule and to keep to it.  In other words, EVERYONE needs to be 
in attendance at team meetings.  The discussion section time period is the guaranteed time period
for you team to meet.
</li>
<li>
Since this is a large class, and since each team will be making at least 4 presentations during
the quarter, we'll have to use some of the discussion sections for those presentations.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>  What will the projects be? </h3>

<p>
Candidate projects can come from many places:  in AY 98-99 some ICS 125
teams worked on projects that sponsoring local companies suggested.
Other teams worked on projects related to on-going research programs in
the ICS department.  Other projects may come from the students.

<p>
Choice of projects is related to many goals.

<p>
One key goal is to pick a project of appropriate size.  It must be big
enough to challenge a team of four students, but not so big as to
commandeer everyone's life!  As a result we will spend some time at the
beginning of the fall attempting to size various projects.  These
planning estimates will be revisited as the course progresses.

<p>
Another goal is to select a different project for each team.   Since
each team will be making regular project presentations to the rest of
the class, diversity of projects will enable students to learn from
experiences across a range of project topics.

<p>
Still another goal is to work on something fun and interesting!  I've
had students working on flight simulators, generating HTML pages,
linking MPEG movie frames via hypertext to other artifacts, and
building graphical program editors.  There are many opportunities....

<h3>  How will teams be composed? </h3>

Each team will have 4 or 5 people.  I will attempt to balance a team's
aggregate expertise with the project they've decided to work on.  I
will also attempt to accommodate personal preferences for teammates.
The course survey form, which you will complete the first day of class, is
a key instrument in assigning the teams.


<H3> What's the Drop/Add policy?</H3>

<p>
Since ICS 125 has a strong team project orientation, it is essential
that the drop/add process be terminated early.  Therefore <em> NO drops
or adds </em> of ICS 125 will be permitted after the end of the SECOND
week of class.

<hr>
<h1> Lecture Topics </h1>

<p>
ICS 125 is on a tight time schedule, thus there is not much time for review.
You are expected to recall the material covered in ICS 121 and the other
prerequisite courses.
Short supplementary lectures are anticipated on:
	<ul>
	<li> Teamwork and team organizations
	<li> Project management
	<li> Project cost and schedule estimation
	<li> Usability evaluation and user interface prototyping
	<li> Software architectural choice
	<li> Configuration management and version control
	<li> Distributed software engineering
	<li> Engineering of distributed applications, including distributed object technology
	</ul>
Specific choice of lecture topics will depend somewhat on the projects
chosen by the teams.  If several of the projects, for example, are
concerned with Internet applications, then lectures on protocols and
Web technologies will be included.  Similarly if most projects will be
using some particular kind of infrastructure, such as CORBA or ActiveX,
then there will be lectures on that.

<HR>
<a name="textbooks"></a>
<H1> Textbooks </H1>

<p>
Regardless of the project chosen, all students will be required to read
<em> The Mythical Man-Month</em>.  Depending on the projects chosen additional
readings from various sources may be required.

<h1> Assignments and Assessment </h1>
<P>
The project is the focus of this course and will be assessed
accordingly.  It will account for 80% of your grade; this is broken
down between deliverables, a team Web page, and presentations.  The
remaining 20% will be divided among individual course logs, teamwork,
individual leadership demonstrated, and the final.

<h2>
Deliverables</h2>
The ICS 125 project nominally consists of five major assignments. Their
relative weighting (as a percentage of your final grade) of each deliverable
is indicated in the table below along with the due date. The on-line versions
of the assignments may still be under construction (watch the what's new
section to see when they are available).

<p>
The deliverables are weighted according to the relative amount of time
and effort we expect you will spend on each (and not necessarily on their
importance with respect to software development). Variations to this may
be made to accommodate the particular needs of a given project or a given
team. Also, note that the grade for a deliverable will consist not only
of the document/specification, developed during that phase but also
the test plan developed along side it as well as the review conducted in
class the following week.

<h3>
Deliverable Due Dates</h3>
<p>
Deliverables are due at 12:50 PM on the date indicated in the table above.
NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.
This applies to your final system and all intermediate projects.
Since you are working in this class
as part of team, it is the team's responsibility to ensure that assignments
are turned in on time.  Normal excuses for late assignments, such as
illness, do not apply in a team setting (unless of course everyone on the
team is ill  :-)

<p>
Unless directed otherwise, deliverables must be turned in directly to the
TA or placed in the TA's mailbox before that time. 

<h3>
Deliverable Reviews</h3>
Each deliverable will be reviewed in class. Each team will be given 15-20
minutes to present their project.  You will be given guidance in class on
how to conduct these presentations.

<p>
Your customer should be invited to your team's Prospectus and Requirements review
as well as your demonstration (and, possibly even your design and code
reviews depending on the nature of your customer).&nbsp; The review is
your team's chance to inform as well as obtain feedback and ideas from
all relevant parties; your document will be reviewed at this time by course
staff and clients as well as the rest of the class.&nbsp; This review is
a formality, however, and each team should have presented and negotiated
both relevant documents to the customer prior to the review (if you haven't,
it may be unpleasantly obvious by the interactions at this time).

<h3> Document Requirements</h3>
<P>
All the documents associated with the above listed phases are integral
parts of systematic software development.  Their continued, up-to-date
existence is necessary for successful system development.
<b>Do not delete</b> documents after they have been turned in.  They must
reside permanently on your team's website.

<P>
All deliverable documents must be prepared on-line and be available as part
of your project home page either as either HTML or .pdf files.  NO MS Word files.
In general, the following should be observed.
<DL ><DT>Cover "page".
<DD> Every deliverable shall have identifying information giving
<DL ><DT><DD> Project title
<DT><DD> Development phase and deliverable
<DT><DD> Date
<DT><DD> Team name/number
<DT><DD> Team members
<DT><DD> Phase manager
<DT><DD> Phase clerical person
<DT><DD> Files and locations (href's)
<P>
</DL>

<P>
<DT>Table of Contents.
<DD> Every deliverable shall include a table of contents
<DT>Specification.
<DD> The system specification (requirements, design,
module specs, code) for each deliverable shall correspond in form and
content to the outline provided for that phase.
Sections that are not necessary for this application shall be marked
``N/A''.
<DT>Minutes.
<DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied by minutes of
team meetings held during the associated period of time.


<DT>Performance Appraisals.
<DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied
by performance appraisals.  Performance appraisals shall NOT be maintained
as part of the project's web page.  A form is available at
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/performance_appraisal.pdf"> 
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/performance_appraisal.pdf
</a>.  A 
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/performance_appraisal.ps"> 
.ps file </a> is also available.

<DT>Project WebPage.
<DD> The project deliverables, except for the performance appraisals,  shall be maintained
in a project homepage.  
</DL>


<h3>``Fixed up'' Deliverables</h3>
<P>
For all deliverables, except for the last, you will also have the opportunity
to ``fix it'' based on its evaluation.  You may hand in an improved
version of a deliverable one week after that deliverable has been
graded and receive up to 50% of the points deducted on the initial
version.  The purpose of this exercise is for you to both learn how to
use the techniques and so that you do not implement something from a
bad design or specification.  You should keep the
same responsibilities for the improvement phase but assign new
responsibilities for the next phase.


<H3> Course Log</H3>
<P>
During your career you will need to keep track of how you spend your time
either for you employer or to improve your own productivity.
Throughout this course, you will practice doing this by keeping a
course log recording the time you spend on all activities related to
this course.  At the beginning of each week you must email the previous week's log to the TA.
A sheet showing what should be on the log is available at: <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99//logform.html">
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/logform.html </a>.
<p>
Keep a copy of your logs:  you will need them at the end of the quarter for the final
review.  

<P>
Each entry records the date and amount of time spent, type of entry,
and text describing the entry.  An entry is one of three types:
<UL><LI> A <i>description</i> records an activity;
<LI> An <i>explanation</i> says why something happened;
<LI> A <i>prescription</i> is a plan for something to do later.
</UL>

<p>
Most entries will be of the first type, but occasionally you should
reflect and think about what is going on.
The time entry applies for descriptions of activities and records the
amount of time spent in hours, to the nearest quarter hour.

<P>
You will be marked down only for failing to email logs each week,
giving too little detail, or failing to keep track of time spent.  

<P>
You are especially encouraged to keep track of the kinds of errors
you make and the amount of time they consume.  The purpose of recording
these errors is so that you develop a better understanding of the
kinds of mistakes you typically make.  With that understanding you
can improve your performance in the future, by paying extra attention
to those areas in which you've had problems in the past.

<hr>
<a name="apportionment">
<H1> Team Composition, Activities,  and Peer Apportionment of Credit</H1>
<P>
As discussed in class, teams will be assigned on as fair a basis as
possible for the project.  The danger most students perceive in
working on projects with other students is in being saddled with (what
they think is) a "non-producer".  This is particularly true when
you don't get to choose all your teammates (the situation here).  Many
factors dictate the use of a multi-person project for this course.
You will not, after all, be able to choose your workmates in the
future.  Therefore, to alleviate your concerns and to grade you
appropriately, at the end of the term project you will be asked to
divide 100 points among the members of your project team,
corresponding to how you believe they contributed to the project as a
whole (or on a phase-by-phase basis if you wish).  In addition, each
team member will be appraised for each phase.  This ``peer
apportionment of credit'' will be used to help determine appropriate
individual grades for the project component.

<H3> Team Organization</H3>
<P>
There are several obvious dangers to group work that can be circumvented.
Ensure that there is adequate coordination among the team members.
Know each other's login names for electronic mail.
Know each other's phone numbers.
Meet <b>at least twice per week</b> (outside of class lecture)
at the same, pre-determined time each week (so as to avoid confusion).  The Discussion Section
is designed to guarantee that such meetings are possible for everyone.  You are strongly
urged to use that time slot.

<p>
Have a contingency plan for submitting a document on time even if
the responsible manager becomes unavailable.

<p>
You are <b>strongly</b> advised to consult weekly with the instructor/TA
about your progress, problems, questions, etc.

<h3> Meetings</h3>
<P>
Meetings are an important part of a team project.
A successful meeting requires that the meeting have a definite
purpose and associated agenda (these are the responsibility of the
phase manager) and that all decisions be recorded in minutes
(the responsibility of the phase clerical person).
<P>
The purpose of minutes is to record decisions made
and to be available for updating any team member who misses a meeting.
Each deliverable must be accompanied by agendas and minutes
for the team meetings held during the associated period of time.
I.e., keep the agenda, and the minutes, on-line as part of your project web page.
The minutes should outline
<OL><LI> agenda for the meeting
<LI> team members present and reason for any member's absence
<LI> major design decisions discussed
<LI> task assignments made
<LI> future meetings scheduled
</OL>

<a name="costs"></a>
<H1> Cost and Benefits</H1>

<p>
This course will demand a lot, but I think that you may well find this
to be the most rewarding courses that you will take in your
undergraduate career.  ICS Alumni have said repeatedly that ICS 125 was
<em> the most important </em> class that they took at UCI.  The
techniques presented in class actually work and will help you in future
software development.    

<p>
At the end of the class I encourge you to make copies of your
project website/notebook for each team member.  Take them with you when
you go to a job interview.  Students from past ICS 125 classes
have frequently said that it was their project notebook that 
clinched a job for them.  Some interviewers have commented that 
the quality of the process followed by the ICS 125 teams and the
quality of the product exceeds those of the production engineers
in their companies.
