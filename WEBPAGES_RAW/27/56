The efficient processing of similarity joins is important for a large 
class of applications. The dimensionality of the data for these 
applications ranges from low to high. Most existing methods have 
focused on the execution of high-dimensional joins over large 
amounts of disk-based data. 
	The increasing sizes of main memory 
available on current computers, and the need for efficient processing  
of spatial joins suggest that spatial joins for a large class of
problems can be processed in main memory. 
	In this paper we develop two new spatial join algorithms,
the Grid-join and EGO*-join,  and study their performance 
in comparison to the state of the art algorithm, EGO-join, and the
RSJ algorithm. 
 
Through evaluation  we explore the domain of applicability of each 
algorithm and provide recommendations for the choice of join algorithm 
depending upon the dimensionality of the data as well as the critical 
epsilon parameter. We also point out the significance of the choice 
of this parameter for ensuring that the selectivity achieved is 
reasonable. 
The proposed EGO*-join algorithm always, often significantly, outperforms
the EGO-join. For low-dimensional data the Grid-join outperform both the
EGO- and EGO*- joins. 

An analysis of the cost of the Grid-join is presented and highly accurate cost 
estimator functions are developed. These are used to choose an appropriate 
grid size for optimal performance and can also be used by a query optimizer
to compute the estimated cost of the Grid-join.
