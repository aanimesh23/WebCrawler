"<b>An Information Flow Model of Fault Detection,</b>"</A>

pages 182-192, Cambridge, MA, June 1993.

<H2> Abstract </H2>

RELAY is a model of how a fault causes a failure on execution of some test 
datum. This process begins with introduction of an original state potential 
failure at a fault location and continues as the potential failure(s) 
transfers to output. Here we describe the second stage of this process,
transfer of an incorrect intermediate state from a faulty statement to 
output. 

Transfer occurs along information flow chains, where each link in the 
chain involves data dependence transfer and/or control dependence transfer. 
RELAY models concurrent transfer along multiple information flow chains 
with transfer sets, which identify possible interaction between potential 
failures, and with transfer routes, which identify actual interactions. 
Transfer sets, transfer routes, and control dependence transfer are 
unique to the RELAY model. 

The model demonstrates that the process of potential failure transfer 
is extremely complex and full analysis of real programs may not be 
practical. Nonetheless, RELAY provides insight into testing and fault 
detection and suggests an approach to fault-based testing and analysis 
that may be warranted for critical systems software.
