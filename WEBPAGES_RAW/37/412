Shuffling Data into Cloud Oblivion

<b>Abstract:</b>
A shuffle is an algorithm for rearranging an array to achieve a random
permutation of its elements. Early shuffle methods were motivated by the
problem of shuffling a deck of cards. An oblivious shuffle is a distributed
shuffle executed by a client who permutes an array of encrypted data items
stored at a server in such a way that the server cannot determine the output
permutation with probability better than a random guess. Several private cloud
storage solutions that obfuscate the access pattern to the data use an
oblivious shuffle as a fundamental building block. We present the Melbourne
Shuffle, a simple and efficient oblivious shuffle that allows a client with
O(√n) memory to obliviously shuffle  an array of size n stored at a server by
exchanging O(√n) messages of size O(√n). The Melbourne Shuffle is the first
provably secure oblivious shuffle that is not based on sorting.

This talk is based on the paper “The Melbourne Shuffle: Improving Oblivious
Storage in the Cloud” by Olga Ohrimenko, Michael Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia
and Eli Upfal, International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming
(ICALP), 2014 (to appear).
