<b>Install a new version of Eclipse to use with MinGW C++</b>
<p>
MinGW means <b>Min</b>imalist <b>G</b>NU for <b>W</b>indows: GNU is a source
  of open source programming tools (GNU stands for GNU is Not Unix).
<p>
Before starting this handout, you should have first downloaded the files
  needed by <a href="mingw.html" target="_blank">MinGW C++</a>.
Now you will download a version of Eclipse that is already set up to use
  MinGW.
<p>
You may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can
  refer to them while downloading and installing MinGW and Eclipse.
Or, just keep this document in your browser.
You should read each step completely before performing the action that it
  describes.
<p>

<h2>Eclipse: Version 4.4 (Luna)</h2>
<p>

The Eclipse download requires about 200 MB of disk space; keep it on your
  machine, in case you need to re-install Eclipse.
When installed, Eclipse requires an additional 200 MB of disk space.
<p>

<h3>Downloading Eclipse</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php" target="_blank">
      Eclipse</a><p>
    The top of the following page will appear in your browser.
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsedownloadpage0.jpg">
    <p>
    In this handout we will download <b>Eclipse Standard 4.4</b> for
      Windows 32 Bit (the current version is 4.5 Mars); if your computer uses
        Windows, continue below; otherwise
        look for the pull-down list showing <b>Windows</b> and instead choose
        either <b>Mac OS X (Cocoa)</b> or <b>Linux</b> and then continue below.
    <p>
    It is critical that Java, MinGW, and Eclipse are either all 32 Bit or are
       all 64 Bit (and only if your Machine/OS supports 64 Bit): I think it
       easiest to use 32 Bit for everything.

<p>
<li>Click the <b>Windows 32 Bit</b> Operating System for your machine,
      under the heading <b>Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers</b> (the fourth
      selection from the top).
    <p>
    <img src="images/eclipsedownloadpage.jpg">
    <p>
    You will see the following page (don't worry about the name of the
      institution to the right of the big downward pointing arrow).
    <p>
    <img src="images/mirror.jpg">
     
<p>
<li>Click the big downward pointing arrow underneath the
      <b>Download eclipse-cpp-luna-R-win32.zip from:</b>
    The site named here, in purple to the right of the arrow:
      <b>[United States] Columbian University (http)</b> is the
      random one chosen by the download page this time; yours may differ.
    <p>
    This file should start downloading in your standard download folder.
    This file is about 200 Mb so it might take a while to download fully if you
      are on a slow internet connection (it took me about 5 minutes over a
      cable modem).
    Don't worry about the exact time as long as the download continues to make
      steady progress.
    In Chrome progress is shown on the bottom-left of the window, via the icon
    <p>
    <img src="images/downloadprogress.jpg">
    <p>
    The file should appear as
    <p>
    <img src="images/downloadfile.jpg">
    <p>
    Terminate the window browsing the Eclipse download.

<p>
<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Eclipse
      (and reinstall it later, if necessary).
<p>
<li>Start the <b>Installing</b> instructions directly below.
</ol>

<p>
<hr align="left" width="33%">

<h3>Installing Eclipse</h3>
<ol>
<li>Unzip <b>eclipse-cpp-luna-R-win32.zip from:</b>, the file that you just
     downloaded and moved.
    <br>
    On my machine (running Windows 7), I can
    <ul>
    <li>Right-click the file.
    <li>Hover over the <b>IZArc</b> command from the menu of options.
    <li>Click <b>Extract Here</b>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <img src="images/izarc.jpg">
    <p>
    If you do not have IZArc or an equivalent unzipping program, here is the
      web site to download a free copy of
      <a href="http://izarc.org/download.html" target="_blank">IZarc</a>.
    <p>
    Unzipping this file creates a folder named <b>eclipse</b; unzipping
      200 MB can take a few minutes.
    You can leave this folder here or move it elsewhere on your hard disk.
    I recommend putting the downloaded file and resulting folder in the
       <b>C:\Program Files\</b> directory.

<p>
<li>Create a shortcut on your desktop to the <b>eclipse.exe</b> file in
      this <b>eclipse</b> folder: <img src="images/eclipseexe.jpg">
    <br>
    On most Windows machines, you can
    <ul>
    <li>Right-press the file <b>eclipse.exe</b>
    <li>Drag it to the desktop.
    <li>Release the right button.
    <li>Click <b>Create shortcut here</b>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Now you are ready to perform a <b>one-time only</b> setup of Eclipse on
      your machine.

<p>
<li>Double-click the shortcut to Eclipse that you just created above.
    <p>
    The following splash screen will appear
    <p>
    <img src="images/splash.jpg">
    <p>
    and then a <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window will appear.
    <p>
    <img src="images/workspacelauncher.jpg">
    <p>
    In the <b>Workspace</b> text box, your login name should appear between
      <b>C:\Users\</b> and <b>\workspace</b>, instead of <b>Administrator</b>.
    <p>
    Leave <b>unchecked</b> the 
      <b>Use this as the default and do not ask again</b> box.
    Although you will use this same workspace for the entire quarter (checking
      projects in and out of it), it is best to see this
      <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window each time you start Eclipse, to
      remind you where your workspace is located.

<li>Click <b>OK</b>.
    <p>
    Progress bars will appear at the bottom of the spash screen as Eclipse
      loads.
    <p>
    Eventually the Eclipse workbench will appear with a <b>Welcome</b> tab
      covering it.
    <p>
    <img src="images/welcome.jpg">

<p>
<li>Terminate (click <b>X</b> on) the <b>Welcome</b> tab.
    <p>
    You will not see the <b>Welcome</b> tab when you start Eclipse after this
      first time.
    You should now see the following Eclipse workbench.
    <p>
    <img src="images/postwelcome.jpg">
    <p>
    Notice the <b>C/C++</b> words/icon appear on the top left (in the Window
      title-bar) and below the upper right-hand corner (beneath the tool-bar).

<p>
<li>To simplify the edit/build-recompile/run loop that we will discuss below,
      perform the following operation: after completing it, clicking
      <b>Build</b> or <b>Run</b> will automatically save the contents of any
      edited file before the program is rebuilt and run.
    <ul>
      <li>Select <b>Window</b> | <b>Preferences</b>.
      <li>In the <b>Preferences</b> popup window disclose <b>General</b> and
           select <b>Workspace</b>.
      <li>Click "Save automatically before build" checkbox, as follows..
      <p>
      <img src="images/preferences2.jpg">
      <p>
      <li>Click <b>Apply</b>.
      <p>
      <li>In the <b>Preferences</b> popup window disclose <b>Run/Debug</b> and
           select <b>Launching</b>.
      <li>In the "Save required dirty editors before launching" section click
           the <b>Always</b> radio button as follows.
      <p>
      <img src="images/preferences.jpg">
      <p>
      <li>Click <b>Apply</b>.
      <li>Click <b>OK</b>.
    </ul>
    Once you have set up these preference in a workspace on your home machine,
      you will never have to peform this step again.
</ol>
Eclipse is now installed for C++.
Start the <b>Testing</b> instructions directly below.
<p>

<hr align="left" width="33%">
<h3>Testing Eclipse, C++, and Libraries</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="ics46-templates.zip">ics46-templates.zip</a> file
       and unzip it.

<p>
<li>Select <b>File</b> | <b>Imports</b> as shown below.
      <p>
      <img src="images/import.jpg">
      <p>

<li>Disclose <b>General</b> and select <b>Existing Projects into Workspace</b>
as shown below.
      <p>
      <img src="images/existingprojects.jpg">
      <p>

<li>Click <b>Next&gt;</b><br>
Browse to the <b>ics46-templates</b> folder you downloaded and unzipped in
above.<br>
Click the "Copy projects into workspace" checkbox, as shown below.
      <p>
      <img src="images/copyboth.jpg">
      <p>

<li>Click <b>Finish</b>.
The <b>Project Explorer</b> window should be updated to appear as shown below.
      <p>
      <img src="images/newexplorer.jpg">
      <p>
      You can explore the <b>courselib</b> and <b>googletestlib</b> projects
        by disclosing/eliding their folders and subfolders.
      The software in these projects have already been built, so you do
        <b>not</b> need to build them here.
      <p>
      The <b>project</b> folder should remain unchanged.
      Below (and in the future) you will copy/paste this <b>project</b> folder
        to create a new project folder in which to put your source files for the
        new project.
 
<!--- Not needed: supplying .a files
<li>Either click the <b>courselib</b> icon in the <b>Project Explorer</b> tab
and then click the <b>Hammer</b> icon <img src="images/hammer.jpg">; or
right-click the <b>courselib</b> icon in the <b>Project Explorer</b> tab
and select <b>Build Project</b>.
    The Console window should show the following.
    <p>
    <img src="images/buildresultslibrary.jpg">
    <p>

<li>If you disclose the main icons under the <b>courselib</b> icon in the
       <b>Project Explorer</b> tab you will see the following.
    <p>
    <img src="images/disclosures2.jpg">
    <p>
    The <b>src</b> folder shows the <b>.hpp/.ccp</b> files in the library.
    If you disclose the <b>Debug/src</b> folder, it shows the <b>.o</b>
      files compiled from the library files that are not templated.
    Projects refer to the <b>courselib</b> folder, to find the templated
       <b>.hpp</b> files in the top <b>src</b> folder, and the
       <b>libcourselib.a</b> file in the <b>Debug</b> folder.
    Later in the quarter you will be asked to study the code in the
      <b>.hpp/.cpp</b> files here for your programming assignments.
    If/when you are done looking now, elide all these icons leaving just the
      <b>courselib</b> icon in the <b>Project Explorer</b> tab.
<p>
--->

<li>Right-click the <b>project</b> icon in the <b>Project Explorer</b> tab
  and select <b>Copy</b> as shown below (or click  <b>project</b> icon and use
  the <b>Ctrl+c</b> shortcut for <b>Copy</b>) as shown below.
    <p>
    <img src="images/copy.jpg">
    <p>


<li>Right-click the <b>project</b> icon in the <b>Project Explorer</b> tab
  and select <b>Paste</b> as shown below (or use the <b>Ctrl+v</b> shortcut for
  <b>Paste</b>) as shown below.
    <p>
    <img src="images/rename.jpg">
    <p>

<li>Rename it to be <b>test_set</b> as shown below
    <p>
    <img src="images/renamedtestset.jpg">
    <p>
    and click <b>OK</b>.
<p>

<li>Disclose the <b>test_set</b> icon in the <b>Project Explorer</b> tab: it
shows an <b>src</b> folder which should appear empty, as shown below
    <p>
    <img src="images/disclosedempty.jpg">
    <p>

<li>Download and unzip <a href="test_set.zip">test_set.zip</a>.<br>
Copy/Paste all the files in its <b>src</b> folder into the <b>src</b> folder
  shown in the newly created and disclosed <b>test_set</b> project folder.<br>
Copy any data files (there is one: <b>loadset.txt</b>) into the newly created
  <b>test_set</b> project folder.<br>
Disclose the <b>src</b> folder, which should appear as shown below
    <p>
    <img src="images/disclosed.jpg">
    <p>

<li>Double-click the <b>driver.cpp</b> file in the <b>src</b> folder.<br>
In the Editor tab for the <b>driver.cpp</b> file select all the lines (Ctrl+a)
  and then uncomment them (Ctrl+/).
<p>
    The Editor tab for the <b>driver.cpp</b> file should show the following.
    <p>
    <img src="images/testseteditortab.jpg">
    <p>
    Notice the <b>*</b> prefixing the <b>driver.cpp</b> file name: this
      indicates the file has been modified but not saved.
    You can right-click in the file and select <b>Save</b>, but Eclipse will do
      that automatically when you build a project (if you correctly followed the
      instructions for installing it).
<p>

<li>Either click the <b>test_set</b> icon in the <b>Project Explorer</b> tab
and then click the <b>Hammer</b> icon <img src="images/hammer.jpg">; or
right-click the <b>test_set</b> icon in the <b>Project Explorer</b> tab
and select <b>Build Project</b>.
    The Console window should show the following.
    <p>
    <img src="images/compiledtestset.jpg">
    <p>

<li>Either right-click the <b>test_set</b> icon in the <b>Project Explorer</b>
or right-click in the <b>driver.cpp</b> Editor tab.<br>
Then select <b>Run As</b> and <b>1 Local C/C++ Application</b>.
<p>
The Console window should show the following.
    <p>
    <img src="images/runtestsetconsole.jpg">
    <p>
    You can use this driver interactively to test various operations on the
      <b>Set</b> data type that is implemented by an array
     (from <b>courselib</b>).
    When you are done testing, the <b>q</b> command quits/terminates this code.

<p>    
<li>Comment out all the code in the Editor tab for the <b>driver.cpp</b>
  file (Ctrl+a followed by Ctrl+/).</br>
Double-click the <b>test_set.cpp</b> file in the <b>Project Explorer</b>
   tab.<br>
Uncomment all the code in the Editor tab for the <b>googletest.cpp</b>
  file (Ctrl+a followed by Ctrl+/).</br>
Compile-Build and Run this code: because we are rerunning a project that has
  already been compiled-built and run, we can recompile-rebuild and rerun by
  just clicking the Run icon (<img src="images/runicon.gif">).
Knowing this shortcut is useful.
<p>
Ignore the two warning message: this code uses a for-loop counter
  that is not used inside the loop.
When prompted, type <b>1000</b> and enter, enter, and <b>1000</b> and enter
  (as shown in green below).
<p>
The Console window should show the following.
    <p>
    <img src="images/runtestsetgoogletest.jpg">
    <p>
</ol>
Eclipse and C++ are now working correctly with the <b>courselib</b> and
  <b>googletestlib</b>

<p>
<hr align="left" width="100%">
For subsequent quizzes/programs, you can 
<ul>
<li>Copy/Paste the <b>project</b> folder in your workspace, renaming it
      appropriately for the current quiz/program,
<li>Download and unzip the folder for the quiz/program,
<li>Copy all the files in its <b>src</b> folder (all the <b>.hpp</b> and
      <b>.cpp</b> files) into the empty <b>src</b> folder of  the new project
      folder;
      copy all <b>.txt</b> files into the top-level of the new project folder,
<li>Compile-Build the project; often doing so requires uncommenting exactly one
      of the  <b>.cpp</b> files in the <b>src</b> folder.
<li>Run the compiled-built code.
</ul>
All these steps were shown above.
You should never have to reimport the <b>courselib</b> or
  <b> googletestlib</b>, although I might instruct you to
  change some the the files in the <b>courselib/src</b> folder
  and rebuild the library:
  Read <a href="../../modules46/courselibupdate.html">Updating the Course
    Library</a> Instructions.
