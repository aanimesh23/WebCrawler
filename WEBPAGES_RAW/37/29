    <p>My area is artificial intelligence and machine learning.  
I'm part of the <a href="http://www.datalab.uci.edu">DataLab group</a> 
with Prof. Smyth.  I'm currently working on developing efficient and
scalable statistical inference techniques for tasks such as topic
modeling, collaborative filtering, and social network analysis.
Computational efficiency is of increasing interest due to the increasing
complexity of models (which may be nonparametric and hierarchical) and the
sheer amount of data available to us.


<p>Specifically, I'm interested in using parallel/distributed computing to speed up
machine learning algorithms and allow them to handle massive data sets.
I'm also interested in accelerating the approximate inference techniques 
themselves, by using improved MCMC samplers, faster variational 
techniques, particle filtering, improved contrastive divergence techniques, 
and other tricks. By combining these techniques with parallel computing, 
one can potentially achieve compounded speedups.  For instance, one can learn 
a topic model on a corpus with thousands of documents in a single second by 
running a fast variational algorithm (<a href='pubs/UAI_09.pdf'>CVB0</a>) on an 
8-core machine. 


<!--
Another area that interests me is information extraction, especially 
from a statistical machine learning perspective.  I have also worked on 
topic models.  Check out this <a 
href="http://datalab-1.ics.uci.edu/calit2/">faculty browser</a> that we 
developed a while back.</p>
-->

<p>Other topics that interest me are computer music and signal processing.  
As an undergrad, I once made a <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~asuncion/180/dspage.htm">wavelet-based signal processor</a> 
that produced some interesting sounds.

<p>Another area that I would like to pursue in my spare time is what I have termed &quot;software biomimetics&quot;. Biomimetics is  a discipline which attempts to mimic useful designs found in nature and apply these designs to technology. Visit Georgia Tech's <a href="http://www.cbid.gatech.edu/">Center for Biologically Inspired Design</a> for some examples of biomimetics. What I would like to do is extend this biological mimicry to the software realm. Is it possible to extract software design principles from the software of life?</p>

    <!--
    This is from my undergrad site
    <p>My current research interests are in the areas of artificial intelligence (AI), distributed computing, computer music, and software biomimetics. </p>
      <p>This past summer, I did some interesting AI work with the <a href="http://www.datalab.uci.edu">Datalab group</a>. The projects that I worked on mainly dealt with article retreival and clustering. In one of the projects, we harvested all the research papers that we could find that were written by UCI and UCSD faculty. After generating a probabilistic model on these papers, we created a pretty interesting faculty research browser that clusters faculty based on research topics inferred from their publications. This approach has the potential of being able to foster intercollegiate interdisciplinary collaboration, since faculty would be able to know the names of other people who are doing similar research. </p>
    <p>A couple of years ago, I did some parallel/distributed computing research with the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~bic/messengers/">MESSENGERS group</a>. Basically what this group does is attempt to provide an alternative to the standard parallelization approach of message passing. Instead of passing messages among nodes, the group proposes that it would be better to have Messenger agents that &quot;hop&quot; to the nodes. This new approach is called navigational programming. The group argues that navigational programming makes it easier to transform sequential algorithms into parallel algorithms; in other words, algorithmic integrity would be preserved since the Messenger code would not have to be restructured into many different loops. Restructuring is sometimes inevitable if one uses a message passing approach. I helped to perform a case study (see <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~bic/messengers/papers/ICPP05.pdf">PDF paper</a>) which  compared the performance of navigational programming to that of message passing. </p>
    <p>One interesting research idea that I am starting to pursue is the intersection of AI with distributed computing. Many times, AI algorithms run out of memory since the data sets are too big; thus, it is useful to parallelize and distribute these algorithms.</p>
    <p>Another area of research that I sometimes work on for enjoyment is computer music. I took a <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~asuncion/180/dspage.htm">Digital Signal Processing course</a> in the Music Department a couple of years ago which whetted my interest in this area. One interesting program that I created for that course was a wavelet-based signal effects processor - one can create some pretty interesting effects by simply tweaking wavelet coefficients (see <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~asuncion/180/Asuncion_Wavelet_Final.pdf">PDF paper</a>). Another project that I have done is a choral software project which displays scrolling notes for choir members to sing. This project attempts to visualize notes in real-time across multiple computers, in order to assist the choir to be synchronized and in tune. </p>
    <p>A final area that I would like to pursue in my spare time is what I have termed &quot;software biomimetics&quot;. Biomimetics is  a discipline which attempts to mimic useful designs found in nature and apply these designs to technology. Visit Georgia Tech's <a href="http://www.cbid.gatech.edu/">Center for Biologically Inspired Design</a> for some examples of biomimetics. What I would like to do is extend this biological mimicry to the software realm. Is it possible to extract software engineering and design principles from the software of life?</p>
