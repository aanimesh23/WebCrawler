To install the CloseUp program, first change directory into the closeup
directory, and then enter

perl ./install.pl


Any error messages will be written to the screen. Hopefully
there won't be any.


The install.pl script will create the executable version of the C program,
and will set some perl variables.

########################

The input format is a text file with one line per marker name. A line starts
with the marker name followed by at least one space, and then the map
position(s) of the marker in brackets in the format 

marker (pos chr, pos chr, pos chr).

 e.g.

php20554 (322 9)
umc1465 (236.6 2)
mmp20 (84.8 6)
bnl6.32 (968 1)
lim228 (947.2 1)
rz444c (95.4 1, 102.6 6)
umc1197(cat3) (675.4 4)

If you already have your map data in a MySQL table you can use the
closeup_input.pl script to create an input file from the MySQL table.
You will probably need to edit this script so that the column names
are correct for your table format.

The ONLY line you should edit is the following:

$st = "SELECT marker,chr,cM  FROM $table";

replace 'marker' with the name of the column that holds the gene or marker name

replace 'chr' with the column that holds the chromosome information

replace 'cM' with the column that holds the map position information.

Please note that it does not matter if your data are bp positions,
rank order positions, cM positions, or any other map unit.


As an alternative input format, it is also possible to input data in the form:

marker chr pos

e.g.

php20554 9 322

with one entry per line and entries in no particular order. It is not
possible to mix the two input formats.

########################

To run the program enter

./closeup.pl

This is a perl script which provides a more comfortable interface to the
C program and the results parsers.

If you opt to have MySQL output, the results file will end .mysql, and
you can send this into your mysql database with the command

mysql -p databasename < basename.mysql

replacing the databasename and basename.mysql as appropriate.


If you opt to have plain text output, there will be two output files

1) basename_overview.txt - summary information for each run found

2) basename_detail.txt - details of the individual markers in each run


########################

The closeup.c program itself does not have a user-friendly GUI,
so the simplified perl interface, closeup.pl, is provided (see above).
However if you really want to run the C program directly, a sample
run might look like this:

>$ closeup
To start the closeup program

>Run, Cluster, Fast-run? (r,c,f)
Choose Cluster. That is CloseUp. Run and Fast-run are version of LineUp

>what is minimum length run? (3)
Choose 3. This is the only value we have extensively tested.

>use Fold or SD for density cutoff? (f/s)
Choose f. Using Standard Deviation rather than Fold gives very
similar results. For Fold, the cutoff is how many times the observed
density must be greater than the expected. For SD, the cutoff is how
many SDs the observed must be greater than the expected.

>what is the density cutoff? (2)
Choose 2. This applies to either Fold or SD (see previous option)

>what is maximum cluster size diff? (20)
Choose 20. Matches that unbalance the two cluster halves by more
than 20 times the average distance between genes/markers are not
included in the C2 half of the cluster pair.

>do left extend? (y/n)
Choose n. Left extension tries to grow the clusters both to the
left and to the right, rather than just to the right. It works,
but has not been extensively tested.

>what randomization type? 1) uniform 2) chrom 3) matched?
Choose 2. 1 and 3 are no longer supported for CloseUp.

>how many cycles of randomization (100)
Choose 100 for reasonably quick results. There is generally very
little change between 100 and 1000.

>what is the name of the data?
Choose whatever file you wish to analyze.
