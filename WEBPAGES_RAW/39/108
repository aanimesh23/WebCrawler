<P>
The Computer Game Science (CGS) major combines a solid foundation in computer 
science with a focus on designing, building, and understanding computer games
and other forms of interactive media. The fundamentals of information and 
computer science — along with coursework in mathematics, statistics, physics, 
and film and media studies — provide students with the concepts and tools to 
study a wide scope of computer game technologies. 
<P>
CGS emphasizes design, teamwork, and the understanding 
of computer games and related technologies and media in a social and cultural 
context. The term “computer game” includes games that run on cell phones, 
mobile devices, PCs, consoles, Macs, web pages and even inside automobiles. 
CGS majors design and create games for entertainment, and also for education, 
training and social change.
<P>
The study of computer games is an emerging field driven by advancing computer 
hardware and software technology, the widespread popularity of video games as 
an entertainment medium, and by the interest of artists, economists, 
educators, scientists and many others to use game technologies for 
communication, visualization, computation and learning.

<DIV CLASS="section_content">
<P>
CGS is ideal for anyone interested in learning the technical components of
creating games — computer programming, graphics, network design, database
management, artificial intelligence and much more — and working in teams to
design and implement exciting new games. If you are primarily interested in
the art or management sides of creating games, the CGS major may not be the
best fit for you.
<p>
Students who major in Computer Game Science will:
<ul class="content-list-large">
      <li>acquire a solid foundation in computer science and software development;
      </li><li>learn how to create interactive and human-centered computer game designs;
      </li><li>employ an interdisciplinary approach to computer game design and development,
          drawing on coursework in modeling and design, graphics, software engineering,
          hardware architectures, AI, algorithms, distributed systems, human interfaces
          and aesthetics;
      </li><li>be able to analyze and discuss computer game systems as communication,
          teaching and entertainment media that can be a force for education, social
          change and activism;
      </li><li>graduate with an extensive portfolio of implemented games.

<P CLASS="section_heading"><a href="#">WHY STUDY AT UC IRVINE?</A> <span></span> </P>
<DIV CLASS="section_content">
<P>
Several factors contribute to the strength of UC Irvine’s Computer Game Science program, including:
   <ul class="content-list-large">
      <li><strong>Overall excellence.</strong> Ranked 28th nationally by U.S.
          News and World Report, computer science education at UCI is broad,
          deep and cutting-edge.
      </li><li><strong>Location.</strong> Irvine and Orange County are home to a
          remarkable concentration of game development studios large and small,
          including industry giant Blizzard Entertainment. We consulted with
          these companies (many of which employ or were founded by UCI alumni)
          while planning the CGS major, and they look forward to offering
          internships and jobs to our students.
      </li><li><strong>Collaboration.</strong> We partner with nearby
          <a href="http://www.lagunacollege.edu/">Laguna College of Art and Design</a>,
          which offers a Game Art major. Their student artists work with our
          CGS students to develop innovative, visually engaging games.

The CGS major combines the fundamentals of computer science with about a dozen
game-focused courses. Current requirements for this major can be found in the <A HREF="http://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/#computergamesci">General Catalogue</A>.

<p>
A wide variety of careers and graduate programs are open to Computer Game
Science graduates. The video game industry is comparable in size to the film
and music industries, and job growth projections are excellent for people with
strong technical backgrounds. Many other fields, including mobile software
development, interactive entertainment, and training and education software,
have demand for similar skill sets and knowledge. CGS graduates are well
trained in computer science, and can thus pursue graduate programs or any
career that involves designing, implementing, evaluating or interacting with
computer-based systems.
