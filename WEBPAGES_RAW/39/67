Variants of Alpha-Beta Search</H2>

Although the basic alpha-beta search discussed already is simple and works 
well, there have been several attempts to search game trees even more 
efficiently.  The basic idea behind most of these is that, if we consider 
the scores in the range from alpha to beta as being "interesting" and all 
other scores to be "uninteresting", then alpha-beta gets its 
efficiency by cutting off the search quickly at nodes with uninteresting 
scores.  If we narrow the gap between alpha and beta, fewer scores will be 
interesting and more cutoffs will happen.

<P>First, let's quickly review the original alpha-beta search,
omitting details like hashing or
<A HREF="990202a.html">adjust winning scores for the current ply</A>.

<PRE>
    // basic alpha-beta search
    int alphabeta(int depth, int alpha, int beta)
    {
        move bestmove;
        if (game over or depth <= 0) return winning score or eval();
        for (each possible move m) {
            make move m;
            score = -alphabeta(depth - 1, -beta, -alpha)
            if (score >= alpha) { alpha = score; bestmove = m; }
            unmake move m;
            if (alpha >= beta) break;
        }
        return alpha;
    }
</PRE>

<H3>Fail-Soft Alpha-Beta</H3>

The code above always returns alpha, beta, or a number between alpha and 
beta.  In other words, when a score is uninteresting, no extra information 
is returned about that score.  The reason for this is that the current 
score is kept in the variable alpha, which starts at the bottom of the 
window of interesting scores, and always increases from there, so it is not 
possible to return a score less than alpha.
One of the simplest improvements to 
alpha-beta is to keep the current score and alpha in separate variables.
The following pseudocode uses the constant "WIN" to denote the maximum 
score that can be returned by any call to alpha-beta search.

<PRE>
    // fail-soft alpha-beta search
    int alphabeta(int depth, int alpha, int beta)
    {
        move bestmove;
        int current = -WIN;
        if (game over or depth <= 0) return winning score or eval();
        for (each possible move m) {
            make move m;
            score = -alphabeta(depth - 1, -beta, -alpha)
            unmake move m;
            if (score >= current) {
                current = score;
                bestmove = m;
                if (score >= alpha) alpha = score;
                if (score >= beta) break;
            }
        }
        return current;
    }
</PRE>

With this change, one can determine a little more information than before 
about a position.  If the returned value x is less than or equal to alpha, 
then we still don't know the true value of the position (because we may 
have pruned away some important lines of the search), but we do know that 
the true value is at most x.  Similarly, if x is greater than or equal to 
beta, we know that the true search value is at least x.
These slightly tighter upper and lower bounds don't improve the search 
itself, but they could lead to a greater number of successful hash probes.
The use of fail-soft alpha-beta is also essential in the MTD(f) algorithm 
described below.

<H3>Aspiration Search</H3>

This is not a replacement for alpha-beta, it is just a change to the way 
the outermost call to the search is made.
Normally, when using alpha-beta to choose the best move, one calls 
<PRE>
    alphabeta(depth, -WIN, WIN)
</PRE>
where the huge range between -WIN and 
WIN indicates that we don't know what the true search value will be, so
all possible scores should be considered interesting.
Then, the move one makes should be the one set in the variable bestmove at 
the outer level of the search.

<P>Instead, it is often helpful to call alpha-beta with an artificially 
narrow window centered around the previous search value.  If the result is 
a score within that window, you've saved time and found the correct search 
value.  But if the search fails, you must widen the window and search 
again:
<PRE>
    // aspiration search
    int alpha = previous - WINDOW;
    int beta = previous + WINDOW;
    for (;;) {
        score = alphabeta(depth, alpha, beta)
        if (score <= alpha) alpha = -WIN;
        else if (score >= beta) beta = WIN;
        else break;
    }
</PRE>

The constant WINDOW should be set in a way that balances the time savings 
from a narrower search with the time lost from repeating an unsuccessful 
search.  A typical value in chess might be around half a pawn.
Variants of aspiration search include widening the window more gradually 
in the event of an unsuccessful search, or using an initial search window 
that is not necessarily centered around the previous search result.

<H3>MTD(f)</H3>

This technique, like aspiration search, is just a modification to the 
initial call to alpha-beta.  If a narrower search window leads to faster 
searches, the idea here is to make the search window as narrow as possible:
it always calls alpha-beta with beta=alpha+1.  The effect of such a 
"zero-width" search is to compare the true score with alpha: if the search 
returns a value at most alpha, then the true score is itself at most alpha,
and otherwise the true score is greater than alpha.

<P>One could use this idea to perform a binary search for the true score:
<PRE>
    int alpha = -WIN;
    int beta = +WIN;
    while (beta > alpha+1) {
        int test = (alpha+beta)/2;
        if (alphabeta(depth, test, test+1) <= test) beta = test;
        else alpha = test+1;
    }
</PRE>

<P>However, this will lead to a large number of searches
(the logarithm of the difference between WIN and -WIN).
The MTD(f) idea is to instead use fail-soft alpha-beta to 
control the search: each call to fail-soft alpha-beta returns a search 
value which is closer to the final score, so if we use that search value as 
the start of the next test, we should eventually converge.
<PRE>
    // MTD(f)
    int test = 0;
    for (;;) {
        score = alphabeta(depth, test,test+1);
        if (test == score) break;
        test = score;
    }
</PRE>

Unfortunately, complicated interactions with the hash table can cause this 
routine to get into an infinite loop, so one needs additional code to halt 
the search if too many iterations have been made without any convergence.

<P>One big advantage of MTD(f) is that we can simplify the code to the 
alpha-beta search, since it only really has two parameters (depth and alpha)
rather than three.

<H3>PVS</H3>

Probably the best of the alpha-beta variants, this goes by several names: 
Negascout, Principal Variation Search, or PVS for short.
The idea is that alpha-beta search works best if
the first recursive search is likely to be 
the one with the best score.  Techniques such as sorting the move list or 
using a best move stored in the hash table make it especially likely that 
the first move is best.  If it is, we can search the other moves more 
quickly by using the assumption that they are not likely to be as good.

<P>So PVS performs that first search with a normal 
window, but on subsequent searches uses a zero-width window to test each 
successive move against the first move.  Only if the zero-width search 
fails does it do a normal search.

<PRE>
    // principal variation search (fail-soft version)
    int alphabeta(int depth, int alpha, int beta)
    {
        move bestmove, current;
        if (game over or depth <= 0) return winning score or eval();
        move m = first move;
        make move m;
        current = -alphabeta(depth - 1, -beta, -alpha)
        unmake move m;
        for (each remaining move m) {
            make move m;
            score = -alphabeta(depth - 1, -alpha-1, -alpha)
            if (score > alpha && score < beta)
                score = -alphabeta(depth - 1, -beta, -alpha)
            unmake move m;
            if (score >= current) {
                current = score;
                bestmove = m;
                if (score >= alpha) alpha = score;
                if (score >= beta) break;
            }
        }
        return current;
    }
</PRE>

This shares the advantage with MTD(f) that most nodes in the search tree 
have zero-width windows, and can use a simpler two-parameter form of 
alpha-beta.  Since there are very few calls with beta > alpha+1,
one can do extra work in those calls (such as saving the best move for 
later use) without worrying much about the extra time it takes.

<H3>Recommendations</H3>

My own program uses a combination of aspiration search (for the outermost 
call to the search routines) and PVS (for the inner calls).
However, different games behave differently.  These searches are not so 
hard to implement; as with most aspects of game programming, the best way 
to choose between them, and to tune their parameters, is to implement them 
all and to try some experiments.  All of them should return the same 
search value (or nearly the same, if influenced by the hash table), but 
with different numbers of nodes searched.  Pick the one that leads to the 
smallest search trees in typical positions from your game.
