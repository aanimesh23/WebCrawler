Contact Representations of Graphs in 2D and 3D
</h1>
<h2>

Abstract:
We study contact representations of graphs in the plane and in 3D space,
where vertices are represented by polygons or polyhedra and each edge is
realized by a common boundary between two polygons or polyhedra. In the
weighted version of the problem, we find contact representations with the
additional restriction that the areas for the polygons or the volumes for the
polyhedra realize some pre-specified value for the vertices. We address
different variants of the problem depending on the types of polygons or
polyhedra (convex or non-convex, axis-aligned or not), types of contacts
(proper contacts with common boundaries of non-zero lengths in 2D or non-zero
areas in 3D or improper contacts where common boundaries of zero lengths or
areas are allowed), and whether holes are allowed in the representation or
not.

<p>
In the plane we mainly focus on the weighted version of the problem. We find
optimal (in terms of polygonal complexity) contact representations for planar
graphs (both for axis-aligned and non-axis-aligned polygons) and some
subclasses of planar graphs. With non-axis-aligned polygons we show that
non-convex polygons with 4 sides are sometimes necessary and always
sufficient for proportional contact representation of a planar graph, when
point contacts are allowed; otherwise for proper contacts, 7-sided polygons
are sometimes necessary and always sufficient. We give a linear-time
algorithm in each case to compute the optimal representation. We also give
polynomial-time algorithms to construct optimal proportional contact
representations for (2, 0)-sparse graphs and for maximal outerplanar graphs.
In case only axis-aligned polygons are used, we show that 8 sides are
sometimes necessary and always sufficient for a planar graph. While we do not
have a polynomial-time algorithm to construct such a representation, we give
a linear-time algorithm to compute representation with 10-sided axis-aligned
polygons. We also give linear-time construction algorithms for optimal
proportional contact representations with 8-sided polygons for planar 3-trees
and Hamiltonian maximal planar graphs, and with rectangles for maximal
outerplanar graphs. For contact representation with 3D polyhedra, we consider
both the weighted and the unweighted variants of the problem for both planar
and non-planar graphs and have some preliminary results. We find several
subclasses of planar graphs that have contact representations using cubes or
proportional boxes. We also consider (improper) contact representations using
tetrahedra, and show that planar graphs, complete bipartite and tripartite
graphs, and complete graphs with at most 10 vertices have such
representations.
