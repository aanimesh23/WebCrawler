<h2>Construction Universality</h2>

Like life, it seems possible to build programmable replicators as
well as <a href="logic.html">programmable computers</a>. The only
ingredients needed for the computers above (using the sliding block
memory) are p68s and gliders. p68s can be built by colliding three
gliders: 

<div align="CENTER"><a href="p68-synth.lif"><img src=
"p68-synth.gif" alt="3-glider p68 synthesis" width="95" height=
"43"></a></div>

<p>The glider "side-tracking" mechanism from Life doesn't seem to
work for placing gliders on perpendicular tracks arbitrarily far
away from the replicator -- the kickback reactions I know of move
the track of the kicked glider inwards, towards the source of the
glider causing the kickback, rather than outwards as in life.
Instead, Dean suggests pushing a block to the desired track then
hitting it with two gliders to form a third sideways-going
glider:</p>

<div align="CENTER"><a href="block-to-glider.lif"><img src= 
"block-to-glider.gif" width="31" height="63" alt=
"conversion of block to glider"></a></div>

<p>These reactions together with the glider kickbacks are
sufficient to place gliders on arbitrary tracks, far away from the
source of the gliders. It remains to be seen whether these gliders
can all be synchronized in such a way that they put together a
computer, but it seems likely that this should all work.</p>
