<p> I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science Department at UCI, working under my advisor, <a class="1" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~guoqingx/">
Prof. Guoqing (Harry) Xu</a>. 
<br> Recently, I was recognized as a 2017 Facebook Fellowship Finalist.
<br> My research aims to develop practical techniques to solve scalability issues in Big Data systems. 
<br> Specifically, I am interested in developing programming language extensions, compiler and runtime supports to improve system performance --- efficiency, scalability, latency.
<br> I earned my M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science from UCI in Spring 2015 and Spring 2012, respectively. Prior to this, I earned my A.A. in Mathematics and A.S. in Computer Science from Fullerton College in Spring 2010.

	<li> <b>Yak: A High-Performance Big-Data-Friendly Garbage Collector</b> 
		<ul>
		<li><u>Abstract:</u> Big Data applications often are written in managed languages and have a clear logical distinction between a control path and a data path. These two paths follow different heap usage patterns. State-of-the-art garbage collectors while are effective in the control path, are fundamentally limited in the data path, where most objects are created. This project aims to provide an automated and systematic JVM-based solution while requiring minimal user effort. Our results shows that we can effectively reduce the GC time and improve end-to-end performance considerably.

	<li> <b>Interruptible Tasks: Treating memory pressure as interrupts</b>
		<ul> 
		<li><u>Abstract:</u> Real-world data-parallel tasks developed in managed languages such as Java and C# commonly suffer from great memory pressure. This leads to excessive GC effort and out-of-memory errors, significantly hurting system performance and scalability. Interruptible task is a new type of data-parallel task that can be interrupted upon memory pressure—with part or all of their used memory reclaimed—and resumed when the pressure goes away. Experiments on two state-of-the-art platforms Hadoop and Hyracks show the effectiveness of the technique. All 13 reproduced real-world out-of-memory problems reported on Hadoop are solved using our system. A second set of experiments with 5 already well-tuned programs in Hyracks on datasets of different sizes shows that the our versions are 1.5–3× faster and scale to 3–24×+ larger datasets.

	<li> <b>Facade: a compiler and runtime support for (almost) object-bounded Big Data applications</b> 
		<ul> 
		<li> <u>Abstract:</u> Popular Big Data platforms use managed object-oriented programming language such as Java due to its quick development cycle and rich community resources. However, when object-orientation meets Big Data, the cost of the managed runtime system is significantly magnified and becomes a scalability-prohibiting bottleneck. This project aims to remove this bottleneck in Big Data applications by introducing the novel compiler framework called Facade. Facade can automatically generate highly efficient data manipulation code by transforming the data path of an existing Big Data application. The key to efficiency is that in the generated code, the number of heap objects created for data types in each thread is statically bounded regardless of how much data an application has to process. Using Facade, one can obtain significantly reduced memory management costs and improved scalability.

	<li><b>Cachetor: Detecting cacheable data to remove bloat</b>
		<ul>
		<li> <u>Abstract:</u> Modern object-oriented software commonly suffers from runtime bloat that significantly affects its performance and scalability. One pattern of bloat is the work repeatedly done to compute the same data values. Cachetor is a novel runtime profiling tool that is effective in exposing caching opportunities and substantial performance gains can be achieved by modifying the program to cache the reported data.

	<p>I am the research group's coordinator, working with prospective summer interns. I'm proud to say that in the school of ICS, our group is one of the few groups that have been accepting high school students and undergraduates for summer internship for a number of years.
