I would like to know if any research has been done on the game of zigzag
as described in Brian Bolt's The Amazing Mathematical Amusement Arcade.
Here is his description:

Use a 7 x 7 or 9 x 9 square array of dots.
Start at the centre dot, S.
The first player draws an arrow either across or up and down to the
nearest dot.
The second player follows with an arrow to form a continuous path.
The players move alternately.  The object is to form a path from S to
the home base (A for the first player, B for the second player) without
visiting any point more than once.  The first player to home base wins.
 

      A.   .   .   .   .   .   .      

       .   .   .   .   .   .   .    

       .   .   .   .   .   .   .   

       .   .   .  S.   .   .   .   

       .   .   .   .   .   .   .
    
       .   .   .   .   .   .   .

       .   .   .   .   .   .  B.
