<H2>Lecture notes for April 1, 1997<BR>
A brief history of computer game programs</H2><BR>

Sources: most of the earlier stuff comes from papers in the books "Computer 
Chess Compendium" and "Computer Games" (both Springer-Verlag), consisting 
of reprints of many original papers including Shannon's.  Some of the 
recent material on Deep Blue is reworded from material on <A 
HREF="http://www.chess.ibm.com/">IBM's web site</A>.  Other sources include 
web sites linked to by this page.

Claude E. Shannon writes the first article on computer chess: &quot;Programming a computer 
for playing chess&quot;, Philosophical Magazine 41:256-275. 
He writes &quot;Although perhaps of no practical importance, 
the question is of theoretical interest, and it is 
hoped that a satisfactory solution of this problem 
will act as a wedge in attacking other problems of 
a similar nature and of greater significance&quot;. 
 Modern chess programs still follow the lines laid 
out by Shannon.

<P>
Shannon notes the theoretical existence of a perfect solution 
to chess and 
the practical impossibility of finding it.  He describes 
two general strategies, both based an a heuristic &quot;evaluation 
function&quot; for guessing whether a position is in 
favor of one person or the other:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Shannon Type A</I> - 
expand all sequences of possible moves out to a fixed 
&quot;horizon&quot; (number of levels), combine the 
evaluations of these sequences in a simple tree computation 
(&quot;minimax&quot;), use the combined evaluation 
to choose the best move.

<P><I>Shannon Type B</I> - only perform 
selective expansion of certain lines, using knowledge 
to prune uninteresting branches. For example, Turing's 1951 program only 
expanded lines involving captures.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Shannon thought that 
type B was clearly better but debate still continues 
today (you can find proponents of both sides on 
rec.games.chess.computer).  Shannon's evaluation combines 
terms for material (P=1, N=B=3, R=5, Q=9) and positional 
advantages, similar to modern evaluation functions.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Alan Turing describes and hand-simulates a computer 
chess program of type B. Play best described as &quot;aimless&quot;; 
loses to weak player.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>1956</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Type A program (for simplified 6x6 chess variant) 
implemented on MANIAC-1 (11Khz, 600 words of mem) computer 
at Los Alamos. Does 4-ply search in 12 min. Beats weak 
players.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>1957</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Type B program implemented on IBM 704 (42Khz, 
7K words). Does full chess 4-ply in 8 min. Passable 
amateur.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>1958</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Newell, Simon and Shaw introduce alpha-beta pruning, a general game-search 
technique which effectively doubles the length of move sequences one 
can examine.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>1959</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Arthur Samuel begins experimenting with automatic 
learning techniques to improve the play of a checkers 
program.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Alan Kotok's B.S. thesis project from M.I.T., a program called MacHack 
for IBM 7090 computers, examines 1100 positions/minute.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>1967</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Greenblatt chess program (MacHack 6) on DEC PDP-6 
(200Khz) evaluates about 10 positions/second. It competes 
in 4 amateur chess tournaments, wins 3 games, draws 
3, loses 12.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Zobrist writes the first Go program. It plays like 
a complete beginner.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>1971</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The "Technology" chess program wins 10 pts out of 26 in six tournaments.  
Is this the first chess program written in a high-level prgramming 
language?  It runs on a PDP-10 (1Mhz), and examines 120 positions/second.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>1973</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Until this point, most or all chess programs have been of type B.
Programmers Slate and Atkin, revising their overly complicated chess 
program in preparation for the 1973 Computer Chess Championships,
return to a type A search routine.  Their program
Chess 4.0 wins, and
other programmers start to switch from type B to type 
A. On a CDC 6400 a later version (Chess 4.5) processes 
from 270 to 600 positions/second.

<A HREF="http://www.cis.uab.edu/info/faculty/hyatt/hyatt.html">Robert 
Hyatt</A> begins developing Cray Blitz, for a long time the fastest program 
and from 1983-1989 the world computer chess champion.  As of 1983 it was 
searching 40-50K positions/second, only a little slower than current 
programs on fast pentiums.  Hyatt is still very active today in computer 
chess with his free program

in a match.

IAGO plays Othello at world-championship level 
(according to then-human champion Jonathan Cerf) but does not actually 
play against championship-level human competition.

<P><B>1988</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Deep Thought, predecessor of Deep Blue, created 
by a team of Carnegie-Mellon U. graduate students. 
The basic version of Deep Thought's chess engine contained 
250 chips and two processors on a single circuit board 
and was capable of analyzing 750,000 positions per 
second or 10 half moves ahead. That same year Deep 
Thought became the first computer to defeat a Grandmaster 
in a tournament (Bent Larsen, who had at one time been 
a contender for world champion, being defeated by Bobby 
Fischer in a preliminary championship round).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>1989</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An experimental six-processor version of Deep 
Thought, searching more than two million 
positions/second, played a two-game exhibition match against Gary 
Kasparov, the reigning world champion, and was beaten.

Deep Thought defeated Judit Polgar, at the time 
the youngest Grandmaster in history and still the strongest
female player in the world (ranked in the top 20 grandmasters), 
in another two-game exhibition match.

Gary Kasparov in the first game of a six-game match, 
but loses the match.
