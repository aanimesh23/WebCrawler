<h1> Activities and Events</h1>

IRUS sponsors a range of activities to meet the needs of various groups
in the software engineering field. These activities are designed to foster 
a sense of community, provide a forum for idea and information exchange, 
solve specific technical problems, serve as an outreach to the software
community at large, facilitate joint research projects, and stimulate 
in-depth discussion on topical areas of interest to the community.

TWIST - The Workshop series on Internet-scale Software Technologies</a>
</b>
</font size>
<p>

The TWIST series aims to gather participants from industry and academia
who are researching or developing software
technologies that scale to the Internet. TWIST provides a forum for
discussion and enables quick dissemination of current ideas
within a well-targeted audience. The goals of the workshop series are
developing a better understanding among the different
communities of interest, improved definition of requirements for scaling
to the Internet, better appreciation of the application
domains that require or benefit from this approach, and suggestions for
fruitful research directions.
<p>
These workshops are held annually in the summer months at the
University of California, Irvine.

Research Partnerships</a></b></font size><br>

Research partnerships are relationships typically between an individual
company and an individual faculty member, focused around a specific project 
or topic. The focus is often on collaboration to solve problems of mutual 
interest. In some cases companies financially sponsor a specific research 
project which is conducted at UCI. In some cases the focus is on transitioning 
technology to the company.  Other projects may focus on UCI usage of 
corporate technology. Still others are directed at site visits for information 
exchange, consulting, or arranging summer internships for students.
