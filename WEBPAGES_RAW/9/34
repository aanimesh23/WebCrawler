Modeling Hash Functions as Random Oracles in Cryptography: &nbsp;
New Surprising Results
<br>
Stanislaw Jarecki
</h2>
<p>
Modeling hash functions as random oracles is a heuristic which gives some
evidence that a cryptographic scheme is secure.  We'll show examples of
such arguments, but also show some counterintuitive results arrived at in
this model.  Namely, we'll show that a straighforward implementation of an
RSA-based signature scheme is only loosely related (in its security) to
the RSA problem, while a new scheme which essentially adds only one more
bit to the signature does suddenly become as difficult as the underlying
RSA problem.  How can one bit change so much?
