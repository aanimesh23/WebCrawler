      <p>Welcome!  Please note a couple of things as we get started this quarter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first lecture will meet on Thursday, September 22.  The scheduled discussions &mdash; which are optional and will actually be more akin to labs &mdash; will begin meeting on Monday, September 26.  For more information about meeting times and places, see the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>.  For information about lecture material and readings, see the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>.</li>
        <li>I encourage you to spend some time reading through the material on the course web site.  It will be updated periodically throughout the quarter, and there will always be an announcement here describing each update.  For now, notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>, the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>, and the <a href="ProjectGuide">Project Guide</a>, as well as a set of <a href="NotesAndExamples">Notes and Examples</a> &mdash; mostly emanating from the lectures &mdash; that will be posted throughout the quarter.</li>
