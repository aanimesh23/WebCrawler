What rubbish! Who is this guy? Why do they let him post?

&gt;You can fix (?) this by glueing an
&gt;additional block onto each of the  12  faces that's in the middle of a
&gt;coplanar set-of-three.

Nice try, but then the central "hole" is lined with 4 sets of three coplanar
faces. As an alternative, glue an additional block onto each of the 4
faces of each of the four corner blocks.

&gt;As you may already know, if you try to build a polyhedron using only
&gt;regular  n-gons, then the number  m  of them that meet at a vertex is
&gt;limited; indeed the only combinations are  (n,m)=

The listed combinations are the only ones which can occur in _convex_
polyhedra. Of course this does not apply with positive genus.

Those who like this sort of thing will like this book:
