<p><b>Abstract: </b>
Energy consumption is emerging as a critical design concern for
programmable embedded systems. Many reduced Bit-width Instruction Set
Architectures (rISA) (e.g., ARM-Thumb) are being increasingly used to
decrease code size. Previous work has explored energy savings in
non-cached rISA architectures as a byproduct of code size
reduction. In this paper we present an energy efficient code
generation technique for rISA architectures, and furthermore explore
energy savings for both cached and non-cached architectures. Our code
generation technique uses profile information to find the most
frequently executed parts of the program. By aggressively reducing
code size on frequently executed parts, fewer fetches to instruction
memory are incurred, thus reducing the power consumption of the
instruction memory. We achieve an average 30% reduction in instruction
memory energy consumption in cached systems, on a variety of
benchmarks, as compared to non-rISA architectures.
