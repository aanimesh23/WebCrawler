Algorithms for Two-Pass Connected Component Labeling
</h1>
<h2>
Siddharth Gupta
</h2>

<p>Connected Component Labeling (CCL) is an algorithmic application of
Graph Theory. It's is an important step in pattern recognition and image
processing. It assigns labels to the pixels such that adjacent pixels
sharing the same features are assigned the same label. Typically, CCL
requires several passes over the data.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will focus on two-pass technique where each pixel is
given a provisional label in the first pass whereas an actual label is
assigned in the second pass. I will discuss about two algorithms for CCL
along with Union-Find Technique used in those algorithms. I will also
present a parallel implementation for the faster algorithm.</p>
