<P>
Offered jointly with 
<A HREF="http://www.eng.uci.edu/">The Henry Samueli School of Engineering</A>, 
the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) major provides a unique educational opportunity for students interested in 
learning about both the hardware and software aspects of computers, and the application of computers to real-world 
problems. CSE includes methods of organizing and manipulating information (computer science), as 
well as the design of computers and their components (computer engineering). As such, CSE integrates 
interesting topics in computing devices, networks, software and systems engineering.
<P>
CSE graduates are well-positioned for career opportunities in both academia and industry. Our alumni are employed at 
leading companies or continue their studies toward M.S. or Ph.D. degrees at prestigious 
universities.

<DIV CLASS="section_content">
<P>
Embedded devices increasingly drive innovation in consumer goods and products, and often are used in large quantities 
to form sensor networks that monitor the weather, environment, or physical structures. Students interested in 
learning how such devices are designed and constructed are encouraged to explore the CSE major.
<P>
Graduates of the program will:
<ul class="content-list-large">
   <LI>demonstrate broad knowledge of computer science and engineering;
   <LI>design, describe and use state-of-the-art hardware/software systems;
   <LI>maintain awareness of contemporary issues in computer science and engineering in a global and societal context, 
       and an understanding of the professional and ethical responsibilities of their profession;
   <LI>demonstrate effective oral and written communication.
</UL>

<p>
Computer Science and Engineering majors are involved in building hardware infrastructure — computers, networks and embedded devices — as well as operating systems, compilers and networking software. The focus is on cooperation between hardware and software to yield the highest performance. 
<P>
Graduates of the CSE program at UCI can pursue careers that involve traffic management, flight control, earthquake monitoring, automotive control and building smart homes. Many students also go on to graduate school, continuing their studies, conducting research and earning advanced degrees in computer engineering, computer science, information science, management or law.
