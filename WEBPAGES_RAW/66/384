<h1>Triangulating the Square and Squaring the Triangle: Quadtrees and
Delaunay Triangulations are Equivalent</h1>
<h2>Maarten L&ouml;ffler</h2>

<p>We show that Delaunay triangulations and compressed quadtrees are
equivalent structures. More precisely, we give two algorithms: the first
computes a compressed quadtree for a planar point set, given the
Delaunay triangulation; the second finds the Delaunay triangulation,
given a compressed quadtree. Both algorithms run in deterministic linear
time on a pointer machine. Our work builds on and extends previous
results by Krznaric and Levcopolous and Buchin and Mulzer. Our main tool
for the second algorithm is the well-separated pair decomposition
(WSPD), a structure that has been used previously to find Euclidean
minimum spanning trees in higher dimensions. We show that knowing the
WSPD (and a quadtree) suffices to compute a planar EMST in <i>linear</i>
time. With the EMST at hand, we can find the Delaunay triangulation in
linear time.</p>
