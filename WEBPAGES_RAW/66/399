<H2>Applet Server Log tab</H2>

<P>The Applet Server creates a log file that records information
about its communications. This text file is stored in the home directory
of the account that started the Hyperweb Manager. Up to the last 500
lines of the log file are visible through this tab.</P>

<p><b>Note</b>: Since the Applet Server is always initiated through the 
Hyperweb Manager, the log file will be created in the home directory
of the account that started the Hyperweb Manager.</p>
