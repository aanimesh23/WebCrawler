<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>This assignment is due by noon on Monday,
January 26. </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>HCI Notebook: </B>As we discussed the first
day of class, we expect every student this quarter to carry at (nearly)
all times small notebook (as simple as two quarter-folded sheets of paper
or as complex as a hand-held PDA).  Whenever you observe a particularly
bad example of interaction design (or a particularly good one), jot down
the details in your notebook.  Often these instances are fleeting and subtle;
you may think you&#39;ll remember and write it down later, but chances are
you won&#39;t, so it&#39;s best to carry the notebook and record the details
when they occur.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(a)</B>  Pick two different instances of
bad design from your HCI notebook.  These may involve computer systems or
any human-created object.  For this part of the assignment, you may pick
relatively small, simple instances (like the elevator buttons in the new
CS building elevators, but don&#39;t pick ones we discussed in class). 
For each,</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Describe the relevant details of the system
(if your system wouldn&#39;t be familiar to the typical computer science
student, give enough background description to explain it).</FONT></LI>
<BR><BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Explain the problem(s) you encountered, relating
them to failures of usability goals or principles.  (Jakob Nielsen&#39;s
usability heuristics are available at </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><A HREF="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html">http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html</A></FONT><FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>.)</FONT></LI>
<BR><BR>
<LI>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Suggest a way to remedy each problem, again
relating each suggestion to the usability goal or principle that it addresses.</FONT></LI>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Your description of each instance should be
shorter than one single-spaced page of text (though with illustrations it
may actually span more than one page).</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4><B>(b)</B>  Pick a web site somewhere at uci.edu
that you use frequently.  Analyze it as described above, but in somewhat
more detail involving more than one feature or function.  As an upper limit,
don&#39;t spend more than an hour exploring the site and making notes, and
don&#39;t write more than two single-spaced pages of analysis (which again
may span more pages than that as you include illustrations).  </FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Your analysis should address who the intended
users of the site are, what the users want to achieve by using the site,
how the site failed to serve these users and their goals (including, if
applicable, characteristics of the users and their backgrounds that the
site designers didn&#39;t understand or accommodate well), and what makes
your suggested improvements better.</FONT></P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE=4>Your analysis should focus on usability issues
rather than pure functionality; while the line is sometimes hard to draw
(adding a search feature, for example, is increased functionality that also
affects the usability of a site), don&#39;t try to solve the problems by
making the system into something that it wasn&#39;t intended to be.</FONT></P>
