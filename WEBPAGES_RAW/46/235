<p><a href="http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b01378s123/">B01378/S123</a>
  has a period-26 replicator, formed by three dominos, that moves at
  speed 9c/26.</p>

<p>It also contains a small puffer that leaves a trail of staggered dots.</p>

<p>When this rule is run with random initial conditions, the space fills
up with scattered oscillators (primarily single dots) that prevent
replicators from spreading. If the initial density of live cells is
approximately 43%, regions that have live cells on a dead background on
even steps are separated from regions with the opposite parity by
chaotic boundaries that anneal slowly; with other initial densities, one
phase or the other eventually takes over the whole space.</p>
