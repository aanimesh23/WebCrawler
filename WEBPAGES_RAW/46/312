    <p>Graduate courses that I have taken include Analysis of Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine 
Learning, Probabilistic Learning, Bayesian Statistics, Constraint Networks, Belief Networks, and a seminar on 
Unstructured Data Management.</p>
    <p>In Winter '07, I was a teaching assistant for ICS H22, an honors introductory computer science course.</p>
	<p>I am also currently maintaining the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">machine learning repository</a>.

    <!--
      <p>I'm currently majoring in Information and Computer Science at UCI. This page contains some random thoughts on some of the courses I've taken.</p>
      <p>In my first year, I took the introductory H21-H22-H23 sequence. While several data structures were pretty difficult to implement (like the block tree), most projects were very interesting. Applications that I created in my first year include a mini-Google indexer/search engine, an image compressor, and a random sentence generator. </p>
      <p>In my sophomore year, I took ICS 161, ICS 52, and ICS 121. ICS 161 is a course on algorithms that requires a lot of creative thinking to solve puzzling problems. ICS 52 is pretty interesting, although it requires long reports (like a requirements specification and a design document). Both ICS 52 and 121 are useful in terms of preparing one for an industry career in software development. </p>
      <p>In the summer of 2004, I took Digital Logic Design (ICS 151) and Artificial Intelligence (ICS 171). AI was a pretty stimulating course. Here are some random things I learned: 1) it is hard for robots to perform some simple human tasks (like picking up an egg); 2) it is hard for computers to perform natural language processing; 3) the human brain has 10^11 neurons (1 Mhz each) running in parallel, which exceeds the computational power of the fastest supercomputers in existence today; 4) genetic algorithms (despite their popularity) oftentimes pale in comparison to other search techniques and are only weakly analagaous to natural selection. I believe these points converge to one conclusion: life is the product of elegant design. A project I did in that class dealt with the "traveling salesman problem" (finding the minimum-cost cycle that visits a set of cities). View my <a href="tsp/tsp.htm">TSP Java applet </a>. The simple heuristics in the applet employ "hill-climbing" to approximate a good solution to the problem.</p>
      <p>During my junior year, some of the interesting classes I took
were Neural Networks (173), Sofware Engineering Project Course (125),
Digital Signal Processing (180),  &amp; Artificial Intelligence Project Course (175). ICS 173 is pretty fascinating. We learned about biological and artificial neural networks. I wish that we could have implemented a system based on neural networks. What was also interesting was the professor's mentioning of a higher intelligence (God) when he talked about the complexity of neural networks, even though he is an evolutionist. ICS 125 was a team-based project course that worked on real-world projects. Our team implemented part of an intranet site for <a href="http://www.valeant.com/">Valeant Pharmaceuticals</a>. ICS 180 was a fun course (see <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~asuncion/180/dspage.htm">DSPage</a>). In ICS 175, we developed techniques in Matlab for face recognition. My final project attempted to perform &quot;expression recognition&quot; - the template-matching algorithm tried to determine if a person was happy or sad. </p>
      <p>In my senior year, some classes I took were Probabilistic Learning (ICS 274A) and Programming Techniques in AI (172). I learned about likelihoods and other Bayesian concepts in ICS 274A. In ICS 172, we focused on natural language processing. For my final project, I was able to develop a pretty interesting program that could determine the bias of certain texts.
