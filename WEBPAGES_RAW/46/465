The web has revolutionized the way that we do many things. Workflow is no 
exception. A few years ago we saw the emergence of HTTP interfaces on top 
of existing workflow products. Now we are beginning to see the emergence of 
workflow which has been designed from the beginning based around internet 
standards. In the same way that a hypertext document can have pieces served 
from any number of servers, one flavor of new workflow systems is to be 
fully distributed such that different parts of the workflow come from any 
number of different servers. Standardization of directory services through 
LDAP is having a big effect on workflow system, as well as standards in the 
document management field. To help with interoperability, the OMG is 
motivating standards of distributed workflow, with the prominent submission 
being the flow submission which is being readied for voting at this time. 
This talk will cover the elements of flow, web based workflow, and the 
trend of new workflow technology for the near future.

<strong>Biography:</strong>
Keith D. Swenson is currently Coordination Technology Architect for Netscape 
Communications Corp. in Mountain View, California. He has just completed his 
role as architect for Visual JavaScript, a high level web application 
development environment which is now available to the public. At Fujitsu 
Software Corporation he lead the development of Regatta Technology, a 
workflow tool that allows groups of people to collaboratively define the 
processes that they are involved in, while performing the processes, now 
known as TeamWARE Flow. Previous positions include project manager for 
Framework at Ashton-Tate, and development lead for Open Access at Software 
Products International. He is a past vice-chair for the ACM SIG for Group 
Support Technology (SigGROUP). He has been elected a fellow of the Workflow 
Management Coalition, having chaired a working group on the Process 
Definition Interface in the past. He has an M.Sc. in Computer Science with 
a specialization in public hypertext information systems.

As businesses seek to cost-effectively grow revenues through increased 
customer, partner and employee loyalty, delivering responsive service is 
critical. Intranets and extranets can help organizations deliver superior 
service. To successfully deploy intranets as a tool to help companies 
achieve strategic business goals, intranet applications must be developed to 
encompass all necessary parties inside and outside the organization.

<p>

In a world still largely operating in vestigial mainframe development 
paradigms, several principles need to be embraced to realize the full 
potential of Intranet applications:

<ul>
<li>Intranet applications function differently than client/server applications 
    because they serve different users: customers, partners, suppliers and 
    other voluntary users.

<li>Intranet applications are inherently workflow or "coordination" 
    applications because they need to respond, track and enable people to 
    complete actions forother people, rather than simply enter data.

<li>Intranet applications need to be built from open standards so work can 
    cross organizational boundaries, rather than remaining desktop 
    applications for primarily managing data.
</ul>

<p>

In this presentation we will discuss the tools and technologies to design, 
build and deploy successful workflow applications that manage the business 
process of the organization, reaching its customers and suppliers to take 
full advantage of the intranets and extranets of these organizations. We 
will also exemplify with different scenarios that illustrate the nature of 
today's challenges that organizations have as they move to capitalize on 
the new business opportunities that the Internet provides.
