<h2>General Course Information</h2>

<p>
Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks, a midterm, and a
comprehensive final
exam.  The course letter grade will be determined on a curve,
combining numerical scores for homeworks (15%), midterm (35%),
and final (50%).
Group work on homeworks is permitted; each student should turn in his 
or her own copy of the homeworks. The course text will be
<i>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</i>, by Michael Sipser (PWS
Publishing, 1997).</p>

<p>
The course meets Tuesdays
and Thursdays, 9:30 - 10:50 in CS 180.
I will be available for office hours Mondays and Wednesdays 2:00 - 3:00
in my office, CS 358D.
The TA for the course is Kevin Wortman
&lt;<a href="mailto:kwortman@ics.uci.edu">kwortman@ics.uci.edu</a>&gt;.
Kevin's office hours will be Mondays
1:00 - 2:00 and Thursdays 3:00 - 4:00 in CST 124, the office down the
hall from the distribution center.
