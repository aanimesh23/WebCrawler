		<h2>H22 Lab&nbsp;2 - Savings Calculator</h2>
		<h3>Due Date: Wednesday, January 25, 23:59PM</h3>
		<h3>I. Overview</h3>
		<P>
			This lab is written to accomplish several objectives: The first objective is 
			for you to write an implementation of a
			<it>binary search</it>
			algorithm, which is a very common and useful algorithm in computer science. 
			Writing a binary search algorithm is all the more useful because binary search 
			is a non-trivial example of a
			<it>recursive algorithm</it>, which is a fundamental algorithmtic concept. 
			Secondly, this programming exercise asks you to write a
			<it>robust</it>
			code, which reacts well to incorrect inputs given by the user, inputs out of 
			range for the algorithm to meaningfully handle, display, etc.
		</P>
		<P>Optionally (a bonus part), you can experiment with a graphical interface.&nbsp; 
			This is a good exercise for you (once you are done with the basic part), 
			because the way the graphical intefaces are implemented utilizes several java 
			API classes, and hence this exercise will give you some practice with the way 
			java implements class hierarchy. In particular, you will see how to deal with 
			exceptions thrown by some of the methods you will use.&nbsp;</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><EM>Hint:&nbsp; Before you start, read the whole lab, and take note of the paragraph 
				on grading at the end...</EM></P>
		<h3>II. The Binary Search Algorithm</h3>
		Suppose that you are planning an expensive purchase some time in the future. 
		For example, you may be planning for the down-payment of a house or saving for 
		college tuition. You would like to set aside a fixed amount of cash each month 
		and put it in an interest-bearing account so that you have the desired amount 
		of money at the desired time. You will write a program this week that 
		calculates the amount of money required each month.
		<p>
			There are three input numbers that are required from the user. The first is the 
			target savings amount which will be expressed as an integer representing the 
			target number of <EM>dollars</EM> to be saved. We will call this <strong>targetSavings</strong>. 
			The second piece of input is a positive integer with the number of <EM>months</EM>
			until the savings must be achieved. We will call this <strong>numberOfMonths</strong>.&nbsp; 
			The final piece of input is a double with the annual interest rate (i.e. the 
			number 5.3 would be an annual interest rate of 5.3%). We will call this <strong>interestRate</strong>.&nbsp; 
			You will then use these three numbers to calculate the amount that must be 
			saved each month. You will need at least two Java methods to calculate this 
			amount. You may choose to have more in order to break up your code into 
			manageable sized tasks.
		</p>
		<P>Notice that the input is&nbsp;a triple of types (int,int,double).&nbsp; These 
			are the types of the input values, but we recommend that internally your 
			algorithms should use a different representation of all amounts of money.&nbsp; 
			Namely, we recommend that you denote monetary values as integers <EM>denoting the 
				number of cents.&nbsp; </EM>This is because a cent is the smallest money 
			unit, and because an alternative representation as a pair of two integers, one 
			representing dollars and the other&nbsp;representing cents, is less convenient 
			to work with.&nbsp;
		</P>
		<P>
			The first Java method is a method called <strong>amountSaved</strong> that 
			takes in a candidate monthly payment in cents <strong>candidatePayment</strong> 
			and then calculates the amount that would be saved if the person sets aside <strong>
				candidatePayment</strong> cents each month for <strong>numberOfMonths</strong>
			months. The interest will be compounded monthly. That is, starting with the 
			initial value of zero, you will iterate for <strong>numberOfMonths </strong>months, 
			and each month you will add in <strong>candidatePayment </strong>and multiply 
			the amount saved by <strong>(1 + (interestRate/(12*100)))</strong>.&nbsp; At 
			each point, the amount saved should be rounded down to an integer since we will 
			assume that the bank does not keep track of fractions of cents. For 
			consistency, it is best for every one to round downwards instead of using the 
			round method in class Math. (I bet that this is what real banks do too.)&nbsp; 
			[[As a bonus you can experiment with your code to find out the effects of such 
			rounding "error" for some realistic interest rates:&nbsp; What's the 
			accumulative effect of the way the bank rounds the cent fractions?]]</P>
		<p>
			Once you have your method <strong>amountSaved </strong>working you need to 
			write a method that calculates the correct amount <strong>monthlyPayment </strong>
			to set aside. This method should be called <STRONG>calculateMonthlyPayment</STRONG>, 
			(for purpose of simplifying our testing of your code, all these methods should 
			be methods of a <A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~stasio/winter06/lab2/SavingsCalculator.java">
				SavingsCalculator</A> class, and it should take a triple (int,int,double) 
			as an input, as discussed above. The output of this method should be the 
			smallest value of <strong>X </strong>such that <strong>amountSaved( X ) </strong>
			is at least <strong>targetSavings</strong>.&nbsp; This is the minimal monthly 
			payment (in cents) required to achieve the input target savings given the input 
			number of months and the interest rate.&nbsp; To find this value, your method 
			should do a <EM>binary search </EM>for the desired <strong>monthlyPayment</strong>.&nbsp; 
			(You can read more about a binary search algorithm is in chapter 9.3.3.)&nbsp; 
			In order to do a proper binary search, you will need an upper bound and a lower 
			bound for the correct <strong>monthlyPayment</strong>. You should take 0 as a 
			lower bound, while a reasonable upper bound could be <strong>targetSavings/numberOfMonths</strong>. 
			Note that this is the amount you would have to set aside if the interest rate 
			were 0. The binary search algorithm preceeds as follows:&nbsp; Given the 
			current <STRONG>(min,max)</STRONG> values and the target value <STRONG>t</STRONG>, 
			at each iteration the binary search tests if the value for the monthly payment 
			given by median <STRONG>med=(min+max)/2</STRONG>, is greater or less than the 
			desired value <STRONG>t</STRONG> . This test will require the <strong>amountSaved </strong>
			method which you have written.&nbsp; If the <STRONG>amountSaved(med)</STRONG> is 
			greater than <STRONG>t</STRONG>, you should recurse the binary search algorithm 
			on interval <STRONG>(min,med)</STRONG>, and if it is smaller than <STRONG>t</STRONG>, 
			then you should recurse the binary search algorithm on interval <STRONG>(med,max).</STRONG>&nbsp; 
			This way, the algorithm can zoom down on the smallest value <STRONG>m</STRONG> s.t.
			<STRONG>amountSaved(m)</STRONG> is greater or equal to <STRONG>t</STRONG>.
		</p>
		<P><EM>Hint: A good way to keep a sanity check and see if your algorithm does what you 
				expect it to do, is to embed in your code commands that print out all sort of 
				intermediary values your algorithm deals with.&nbsp; Once you are satisfied 
				that the code does what it's supposed to, you can remove these printing 
				commands.</EM></P>
		<p>
			<H3>III. Interface, Robust Code, Exception Handling</H3>
		<P>
		In your program you should only assume that the user inputs some strings as the 
		values of the three input fields. The inputs should be taken from a console. 
		(See examples how to do this in the book and in the lecture notes.) The correct 
		inputs should be two non-negative integer values for the target savings and the 
		number of months, and a non-negative real value between 0 and 100, for the 
		interest rate. Therefore, you must check for the unreasonable input values 
		(like non-numerical values, negative values, out of range, etc.) You also need 
		to check for more subtle problems, like if the number of months is so large 
		that even setting aside a single penny a month will result in too much savings. 
		In each case, you need to print out a reasonable and polite error message to 
		the user. If there are no errors, you should output the monthly value to be 
		saved in dollars and cents, e.g. $45.27.
		<P></P>
		<P>
			The best way to handle certain type of incorrect inputs is by using
			<it>exceptions</it>. In general, from any input (console, file, graphics), you 
			should assume that the inputs given by the user can be extracted only as 
			strings. To extract integer (or double, float, etc) values from such input 
			string <strong>s</strong>, you can use a method like <strong>Integer.valueOf(s).intValue()</strong>
			, (see examples in ch.1 in the textbook), or, a simpler method <strong>Integer.parseInt(s)</strong>. 
			Then, to handle the case when <strong>s</strong> cannot be parsed as an integer 
			(or double, float, etc) value, you should catch and appropriately handle the 
			exception(s) thrown by these methods. One way to find what exceptions these 
			methods throw is to program it first without handling the exception, and see 
			what the java interpreter reports when the input string is wrong. Another (and 
			better) way is to check a java reference for all exceptions thrown by the 
			input-parsing method you use. For example, for the exceptions thrown by the 
			above method, see <A href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html">
				http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html</A>. You can 
			find appropriate classes, methods, and their exceptions to handle 
			string-to-integer (string-to-float, string-to-double, etc) conversion starting 
			from the link above which describes the <strong>Integer</strong> class, and 
			exploring the related classes (<strong>Float</strong>, <strong>Double</strong>, 
			etc).
		</P>
		<P>To facilitate easy testing of your code (both for us and for you), we have 
			implemented a class <A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~stasio/winter06/lab2/SavingsCalculatorTester.java">
				SavingsCalculatorTester.java </A>, which enables you to write a series of 
			test cases, in a file like <A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~stasio/winter06/lab2/input.in">
				input.in</A>.&nbsp; The SavingsCalculatorTester.test method creates on 
			object of class Input, and here is the definition of the java class <A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~stasio/winter06/lab2/Input.java">
				Input.java</A>. The SavingsCalculatorTester reads each line of the input.in 
			file, interprets each of these lines as triples of inputs, and calls the <strong>SavingsCalculator.calculateMonthlyPayment</strong>
			method on each of these inputs. You should modify the code of the 
			SavingsCalculatorTester (where specified) so that it handles all the input 
			errors as explained above, because as it is right now this code assumes the <STRONG>
				input.in</STRONG> file contains correctly formed inputs.

		<H3>Turning in Your Code</H3>
		<P>
			See the <A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~stasio/winter06/lab_intro.html">introduction 
				to the lab</A> to find out how to turn in your files.
		</P>
		<H3>Grading</H3>
		<P>You will be graded on correctness of your binary search algorithm (70%), and on 
			how robust your code is to input errorrs (30%).</P>
		<H3>Bonus (Optional Part): &nbsp;Graphical user interface (and learning about class 
			hierarchy)</H3>
		<P>Here is a sample code which you can use to experiment with a graphical user 
			interface for a program you have written:
		</P>
		<P><A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~stasio/winter06/lab2/GraphicalSavingsCalculator.java">GraphicalSavingsCalculator.java</A>
		</P>
		<P>In this code, the action starts when the user presses the <STRONG>Calculate </STRONG>
			button. Your code will start out in the <STRONG>paint </STRONG>method, but you 
			will need to call other methods from there to do your calculations. You may 
			also decide to have some data that is global to the entire class, although you 
			should only need to keep the three input variables global. You will notice that 
			this GUI implementation uses the <STRONG>JFrame</STRONG> JAVA API class, which 
			is a part of the <STRONG>java.awt</STRONG> package. As you understand how this 
			GUI works, you will see the <STRONG>paint</STRONG> method taking the <STRONG>Graphics</STRONG>
			object as an argument. This <STRONG>Graphics</STRONG> class admits methods like <STRONG>
				drawString</STRONG> which the code above uses to display outputs of the 
			calculations. (For now this code only basically copies the inputs provided by 
			the user, but you will re-write to make these outputs meaningful.) As you try 
			to use this code you will notice that the <STRONG>drawString</STRONG> method 
			writes out the output without clearing first the previous output written on the 
			same spot. Examine the methods provided by this API class and find one that 
			allows you to print the output cleanly, with the outputs of the previous 
			computations erased first. You can examine the documentation of these classes 
			on-line. For example, the JFrame class is described here: <A href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/JFrame.html">
				http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/JFrame.html</A>, and 
			the Graphics class is described here: <A href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html">
				http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html</A>.
