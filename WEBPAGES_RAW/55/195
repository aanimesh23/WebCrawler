  Quiz #3 Graded
</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
The TAs/Readers have graded (and I have recorded the grades for) Quiz #3.
The class average was about 21 (or about 83%); the median was about 21
  (or about 84%).
Look at your returned work carefully; if your score was below 20 (which is 80%)
  you might want to review this quiz with me or a TA.
Material similar to this will be on the first written exam.
Always see your TA/Reader first for grading issues with Quizzes.
<p>
Each TA/Reader graded the same problem for all the students in class.
Contact these TAs/Readers if you feel that your problem was graded incorrectly;
  they will email me and cc you about any corrected grades.

<li>Filjor Broka    :  Problem 7 
<li>Peeyush Gupta   :  Problems 2, 5

We deducted points for turning in materials after class started; and for not
  turning in a single sheet of paper (copied double-sided).
The printed quizzes will be available on Tuesday and Thursday this week in ICS
  183 during the common labs (2am-8pm).
<p>
There are two files that you should download, unzip, and examine to understand
  you performance on this assignment and cumulative performance in this class.
Each is sorted by <b>Hashed ID</b>.
<ul>
<li>The first file to examine stores the
   <a href="solutions/quiz3gradesstudents.zip">assignment grades</a>, a
   zipped Excel file that shows how many points each student received
   on each problem.
<p>
<li>The second file to examine is the grades spreadsheet that is available from
   the index on the course web: it records all the grades for all the testing
   instruments that I assign over the quarter.
</ul>
Generally most students did reasonably on most of the problems.
Sometimes we were looking for a specific answer, and if your answer was true,
  if it wasn't the one we were looking for we deducted points.
Also, student who didn't approximate logarithms base 2 (e.g., Log2 1000 ~ 10)
  and instead calculated logarithms (9.96578, so 10 is wrong by only .3
  percent), or rewrote Log2 1000 as 3 Log2 10, had points deducted, as per the
  directions.
You should learn to do "back of the envelope" calculations, and you will not be
  able to use a calculator during the exam.
<p>
<!--
We awarded an extra .5 pts on (a) problem #2: for actually saying what 2*sqrt(2)
  evaluated to "(compute an actual number"): 2.83...; and (b) problem #7 for
  recognizing the last column was always a bit more than 2 times the previous
  value, which is O(N Log N): this complexity class is so close to O(N) that I
  didn't want to take off points, so instead gave a half point extra credit.
For full points on problem #3 I wanted to see (a) the complexity of binary
  searching, (b) the complexity of precondition checking, (c) the complexity of
  doing both (same as (b)), and (c) a comment that linear searching would have
  the same complexity class.

The TAs will return your written quizzes during their common lab hours.
Please download the <b>Grades(zipped .xlsm file)</b> from the course web and
  ensure that I have computed and entered your grade correctly (I'll be
  entering thousands of grades for students in my courses this quarter, so even
  if I'm 99% accurate, I'm likely to record some incorrect grades.
Note that all grades are recorded as integral values: I always round up
  (e.g., a quiz score of 22.5 is recorded as 23).
<p>
If you believe that we recorded one or more answers incorrectly, please
  contact the TA/Reader first and tell him/her what you think the differences
  are.
Such a discussion can have only positive outcomes: either he/she will agree
  with you that you deserve more credit (and, we do want you to receive all the
  credit that you are due), or you will come to understand the question,
  program, or solution better.
This is certainly a win-win situation.
<p>
Please read the solution and examine your graded quiz carefully
  <b>before</b> contacting your TA/Reader and ensure you understand the correct
  answers.
The TA/Reader will then re-examine issue, possibly asking you for more
  information if there is still confusion, or arranging to talk to you.
If there is a difference, your TA/Reader will email me a revised summary about
  your program, and cc a copy to you.
I will update the grades spreadsheet as appropriate (it might take a bit of
  time for all these events to cumulate in a changed grade).
If you feel there is still a problem after talking to your TA/Reader, please
  contact me (but always contact your TA/Reader first).
Also, because of the size of this class, if you have a grading issue, you must
  bring it to your TA's/Reader's attention within a week of when I return the
  materials.
<p>
Generally exams and quizzes are graded more closely than programming
  assignments.
If the average on any testing instrument is less than 75%, the column for
  that instrument will show the number of normalization points: the number of
  points each student would have needed to earn to have that instrument's
  average be 75%: these number of points are then added to the sum of the
  points for each student (in a later column).
This is the only curving I do in grading.
On this testing instrument (and typically most others, except the written and
  programming exams), the normalization points are 0.

Briefly, in Problem 1, variables <b>a</b>, <b>x</b>, and <b>b</b> and the
  <b>next</b> instances variables in LN objects were checked: fully correct
  updates (new pointers and crossouts) had no deductions; partically correct
  updates had .5 deducted.
There was an additional .5 deduction for not drawing the tails of most of the
  arrows <b>fully inside</b> their variable boxes.
A few students drew multiple linked lists, unlike any pictures that I drew in
  class or were in the notes: they lost all points for this problem.
<p>
In Problems 2-4, each was worth 4 points for correctly working code and 2
  points for doing this as instructed: iteratively or recursively.
If the function was not written iterative/recursively as required, no points
  were awarded for correctness.

You will see the number of points <b>deducted</b> for the linked list in column
  C; columns D-I show whether or not the answer was correct: -1 means all points

Columns D, F, and H show whether the function worked; columns E, G, and I

Row 1 shows the number of points for each function.
Each function has a GoogleTest, and the functions in Problem 1 have additional

Rows 4 and beyond record the scores for students.
Columns C-J are blank if the function passed the GoogleTest and contain -1 if
  the function failed to pass the GoogleTest; for example, a -1 in column E
   deducts 2.5 (the value in Row 1 column E) points from the total.
Columns K-L are blank if the function meets the constraint and contain -1 if 
  the function did not meet the constraint.

<p>
If you scored very low on this quiz, you should ask yourself whether you are
  properly prepared for this course (or whether it was lack or time, or some
  other issue that caused your poor performance).
Possibly you barely passed ICS-45C, but really don't understand the material or
  how to program/debug as well as most of the other students; possibly you
  received credit through a Community College with a less rigorous C++
  sequence; possibly it has been a long time since your last C++ course.
I'm happy to talk to students who feel ill-prepared for this course and would
  like to explore their options.

  <b>Important</b>:<br> Submitting Code<br>without Losing Points
</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  ICS-46 uses software that automatically grades most quizzes and programming
    assignments; it uses Googletest cases that we supply with the testing
    instruments that we distribute.
  You will learn about these tools in Programming Assignment #0.
  Here are a few hints to ensure that you will understand the grading process
    better and minimize your point loss.
  <ol>
  <li>Ensure that you submit the code you wrote, not empty files nor the
        original files that you downloaded.
      Be very careful and <b>double-check</b> what you submit to avoid this
        mistake.
  <p>
  <li>If you are submitting with a partner, ensure that the <b>Submitter</b>
        and <b>Partner</b> lines of the program are correctly specified.
      The names must appear in the exact format required, with no misspellings
        nor punctuation errors.
      The student listed as <b>Submitter</b> must be the one who submits.
      See the <a href="assignments.html">Programming Assignments</a> web page
        for the exact form required (and you must follow that exact form, with
        no misspelling nor punctuation errors).
  <p>
  <li>Ensure that you submit your code on time.
      We can, and mostly do, ignore work submitted after the deadline
        (even by a few minutes).
      It is a fairness issue for other students who do submit on time.
      The best strategy is to finish the work and submit it well before the
         deadline (and get extra credit points).
      To ensure that we will grade something, submit partially complete code
         ahead of the deadline; then, if you miss the deadline, we will still
         grade the partially complete code.
      Be warned: Checkmate can get bogged down if many students all try to
        submit a few minutes before the due time.
  <p>
  <li>Ensure that you test your code using the Googletests that we provide
        and use for grading.
      By using these self-checks, you will know when your code contains
        errors that will result in point deductions when we grade it.
  <p>
  <li>Ensure that your files...
      <ol type="a">
          <li>...build correctly: build without any compiler or linker errors
               using <b>Clang C++</b>.
          <li>...are "uncommented" (commented-out code will compile and link,
                but not run correctly).
      </ol>
      <p>
      Any build errors, will cause <b>all Googletests to fail</b> during
         automatic grading.
      You must replace function/method bodies with code that compiles,
        even if it produces incorrect results when run.
  </ol>
After an assignment is graded automatically, the Announcement for it will
  contain a link to an Excel file that you can examine for detailed information
  about how your score was computed.
<p>
If this information does not match your expectations from running the
  assignment's self-checks while developing your code, contact your TA/Reader.
It is best to meet with your TA/Reader during their common-lab hours: he/she
  can talk to you about your code and run it while you are present, to help
  resolve the difference.
But, if we have to modify your code to grade it properly (see the typical source
  of problems above), we will deduct points.
I hope that by students carefully writing/submitting their code, these
  grading anomalies and point deductions will be minimized during the quarter.

      <p>
  </ol>
  <p>
  Note that for questions that are not specific to you -questions that are
    relevant to the entire class- it is best to ask them on the appropriate
    Message Board Forum.
  <ol start="2">
  <li><b>Message Board Forum</b>:
      Post the the forum most closely relate to your question.
      Include a well-thought <b>Subject</b> line that clearly identifies the
        issue you are asking about; doing so helps me and other students who
        are deciding whether to read your message and the response(s).
      If you discover the solution to your own question, revisit the
        Forum and explain (without supplying code) any useful information that
        you learned that might help other students with the same problem.
      Avoid a post that says just, <b>"Never mind: I figured it out myself."</b>
  <p>
  <li><b>Course Email (ics46-W17@classes.uci.edu)</b>:
      Mostly this is for me to use to communicate with all the students in the
        class.
      But, there are instances (very rarely) for students to use it: the best
        example is that if <b>Checkmate</b> appears to be down.
      Sending a <b>Checkmate down</b> email to this address tells me that it is
         down, and tells all the other students that (a) it is down and
         (b) I have been informed it is down.
      FYI, we rehosted Checkmate on a new computer a few quarters ago, and
        it is now much more reliable and rarely down.

  The software that we are using this quarter (CLion and Clang C++) is being
    used for a second time in ICS-46.
  Over the break, I updated the documentation for downloading, installing, and
    using this software, and checked the courses libraries for it.
  Please bear with me as I correct any confusion/mistakes regarding this
    documentation and my course libraries; please let me know (the MessageBoard
    is best) about any problems you find.

  Install Course Software
</b></td>
<td width ="80%">
  You may work on the assignments <b>using any software development
       environment and C++ compiler</b>, but the CLion IDE (using Clang C++)
       will be the official course software (and what the TAs will use to grade:
       <b>your program must build (compile and link) and Run using the Clang
       C++ compiler</b>).
  You also have the option of using the command-line interface to use Clang C++.
  I recommend that you install and experiment with CLion/Clang C++ and
    become familiar with it during the first week of the quarter (see
    instructions below).
  <p>

  If you are using different software, you are responsible for ensuring that
     your system works with my download folders (for quizzes and programming
     assignments), course, library, and Googletest suites
     (see Programming Assignment #0), and that the programs you submit build
     and run under Clang C++.
  <p>

  I suggest that all students download and install the Course Software on their
     machines: Cygwin (for PC users, to provide a Unix-like environment),
     CLion, and Clang C++ (along with the <b>courselib</b> and <b>gtestlib</b>
     libraries).
  All products are available for free on the internet.
  Students can view instructions for downloading and installing this software
    by following the
    <a href="../common/online46.html" target="main">Course Software</a>
    link.
  </ul>
  <p>

  I expect students with computers to download and install their own software
    by the end of the first week of the quarter.
  If you are having difficulty with this task, the TAs and Lab Tutors will help
    you during the first Common Lab meeting (all students will be able to see
    staff at prearranged times, even though there is no formal lab to attend in
    this class), or beyond, if necessary: bring your computer to the lab; if
    you have successfully downloaded and installed this software, please help
    other students do so too.
  Finally, you can also use the class MessageBoard Forums to ask questions about
    this software and help other students install it.

  <p>
  I strongly suggest that you <b>BACKUP YOUR WORK</b> daily: computers can
    malfunction, break, or be stolen.

  Welcome to ICS-46.
  I am going to post and archive important messages about the class in this
    announcements web page: each entry will be numbered, dated, and labeled.
  The entries will appear in reverse chronological order.
  Whenever you follow the link to this page, scan its top for new announcements;
    scan downward for older announcements.
  This message will always appear at the bottom of this file. 
  I will never remove a message from this page.
  <p>
  I have already posted some important messages before the start of the quarter.
  Expect a few new messages to be posted here each week, mostly regarding
     returned and graded work.
  <p>
  Check this Announcements page, along with your email and the Forums on
    MessageBoard, daily.
