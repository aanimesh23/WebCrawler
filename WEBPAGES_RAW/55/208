This is clearly
polynomial time: the decision problem can be solved by finding
the intersection of O(n<sup>2</sup>) shapes, each the union of two disks, so doing this
naively and applying parametric search gives O(n<sup>4</sup> polylog),
but it might be interesting to push the time bound further.

I'm not sure I see why this should be useful or interesting, but the
idea seems to be to define geometry-like structures (having objects
called points and lines that somehow resemble Euclidean points and lines)
that are non-uniform in some strong sense: every Euclidean axiom
(and why not, every Euclidean theorem?) should be true at some point of
the geometry and false at some other point.

Bill Taylor describes a construction of a warped
tic tac toe board from a given convex quadrilateral,
and asks for a proof that the middle quadrilateral
has area 1/9 the original.  Apparently this is not
even worth a chocolate fish.
