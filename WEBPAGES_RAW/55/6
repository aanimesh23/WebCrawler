<b>Abstract</b><BR>
Recent work in knowledge compilation suggests 
that relations which can be described precisely 
by either Horn theories or tree constraint
networks are identifiable in output polynomial
time. Algorithms for computing approximations 
using these languages were also proposed.
Upon testing such approximations on artificially 
generated and real life data, it was immediately 
observed that they yield numerous
superfluous models. As a result, although certain 
entailment queries can be answered reliably, 
these methods may be ineffective for a
large class of membership queries.
To improve the approximation quality, we investigate 
here the k-decomposition problem, that is, determining 
whether a relation can be described by a disjunction of 
k tractable theories. The paper discusses the complexity of this
task, outlines several algorithms for computing
both exact and approximate k-decompositions,
and evaluates the potential of this approach
empirically. We focus on the class of tree constraint 
networks and Horn theories and report
results on artificially generated relations and
on three real life cases. Our experiments show
that for uniform random relations, the quality
of upper bound approximations improves as k
increases. However, when we require very high
accuracy, decomposition is not effective since k
grows linearly with the size of the data. When
the data comes from a near-tractable source,
the approach is useful. Experiments show that
for the King Rook King problem the generalizing 
power of such methods is comparable to
that of recently developed learning algorithms.
