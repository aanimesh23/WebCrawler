Here is a trace of the Maps needed to run Dijkstra's Extended Shortest Paths
algorithm. You need to look at the equivalent graph to follow the logic below.
The result is answer_map, from which we can find the shortest path cost (and
the nodes on this route) from the given node (here "BWI"). Note that we show
the info_map and answer_map as sorted to make them easier to read; of course
thre is no special ordering in these maps. We will NOT show the info_pq, but
instead just "notice" which cost is minimal and remove it when required.

See the algorithm described in the accompanying lecture.

Retrieve the distance to each in info_map (smallest distance so far) and

  new predecessor) and enqueue them into the info_pq.

The info_map is empty so the algorithm stops.

Say we want to know the shortest path from "BWI" to "LAX".
We push "LAX" on a stack and look up predecessor "DFW".
We push "DFW" on a stack and look up predecessor "ORD".
We push "ORD" on a stack and look up predecessor "BWI".
We push "BWI" on a stack and look up predecessor "?"; so we stop.

Now we pop off all the values in the stack and add them to a queue that shows
the shortest, route: queue[BWI,ORD,DFW,LAX].
