These questions were used for the ICS 261 component of the ICS
phase II exam, May 2004. However, I think they may be too difficult
for this purpose. So, while they may be useful as practice
questions, please do not assume that future exam questions will be
equally difficult. 

<p>(a) Describe an efficient data structure for the following
problem: you are given as input a set S of n points in the x-y
plane, and must handle queries that specify query values a and b
and return any point (x,y) in S with y &lt;= ax+b, if such a point
exists. What is the space usage, preprocessing time, and query time
of your data structure?</p>

<p>(b) Suppose that there exists a data structure D for problem (a)
that solves the problem in space R(n), preprocessing time P(n), and
query time Q(n). Now we must solve a slightly more difficult
problem: for each query, we must find the point with the smallest x
coordinate among all points (x,y) in S with y &lt;= ax+b. Describe
how to use data structure D as part of a layered data structure
that solves this harder problem. Analyze the space usage,
preprocessing time, and query time of your overall data structure
in terms of P, Q, R, and n.</p>
