<h2>Glider Logic</h2>

We can build logic circuits out of several elements: <a href= 
"guns.html">guns</a> to create constant-one signals; <a href= 
"react.html">vanishing reactions</a> used as "a and not b" gates
(which are sufficient to build up all other boolean formulas);
eaters to delete stray gliders; <a href="guns.html">turns</a> to
connect and resynchronize signal paths; and two-to-one or
two-to-two <a href="react.html">glider reactions</a> to copy
signals. 

<p>The only remaining ingredient for
<a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/durand98game.html">universality</a>
is some kind of
memory. Dean suggests a sliding block memory, based on reactions in
which glider salvos push or pull a block two squares:</p>

<div align="CENTER">
<table cellpadding="15">
<tr align="CENTER" valign="MIDDLE">
<td><a href="block-push.lif"><img src="block-push.gif" width="95"
height="43" alt="3 gliders push a block 2 units"></a></td>
<td><a href="block-pull.lif"><img src="block-pull.gif" width="163"
height="47" alt="4 gliders pull a block 2 units"></a></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>To detect a block in the zero position, we shoot a glider at
it:</p>

<div align="CENTER"><a href="block-detect.lif"><img src= 
"block-detect.gif" width="27" height="35" alt=
"glider removes a block"></a></div>

<p>If the glider disappears we know the block was at zero; we then
rebuild the block using a head-on collision:</p>

<div align="CENTER"><a href="block-synth.lif"><img src= 
"block-synth.gif" width="31" height="39" alt=
"2 gliders form a block"></a></div>

<p>I prefer a delay line memory to a sliding block, for reasons of
computational efficiency. The best version of this I've been able
to set up involves reflecting salvos of gliders off the back of a
pair of <a href="glider.html">c/3 spaceships</a>:</p>

<div align="CENTER"><a href="delay-line.lif"><img src= 
"delay-line.gif" alt="glider packets reflect from a c/3 spaceship"
width="395" height="131"></a></div>

<p>One could instead base a delay line on a reaction with the c/5
spaceship that turns a glider into a block, but that would require
more careful synchronization.</p>

<p>These all haven't been put together into an explicit universal
computer, but I think it should be clear that such a computer
exists.</p>
