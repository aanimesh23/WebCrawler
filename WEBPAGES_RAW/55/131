<h1>Computational Complexity of Games and Puzzles</h1>

Many of the games and puzzles people play are interesting because
of their difficulty: it requires cleverness to solve them. Often
this difficulty can be shown mathematically, in the form of
computational intractibility results: every NP-complete problem is
in some sense a puzzle, and conversely many puzzles are
NP-complete. Two-player games often have higher complexities such
as being PSPACE-complete. 

<p><i>WW</i> (pp. 218-219; see <a href="#refs">references</a>
below) is disparaging of this sort of result, writing that "this
asymptotic result says little about the difficulties of calculating
good strategies", describing NP-hard game positions as "degenerate"
and "relatively dull", and advocating (as a response to hardness
proofs) looking for additional rules and conditions that would make
the game easier. But to me NP-completeness is not the end but the
beginning of the study of a game: it shows that the game is complex
enough that we can encode interesting computational problems within
it. If a game is in P, it becomes no fun once you learn "the trick"
to perfect play, but hardness results imply that there is no such
trick to learn: the game is inexhaustible. And of course
NP-completeness or PSPACE-completeness doesn't even rule out the
possibility of computing game values exactly; true, it seems to
imply that worst-case-exponential algorithms are required, but
there is still plenty of interesting work in designing, analyzing,
and implementing such algorithms.</p>

<p>There is a curious relationship between computational difficulty
and puzzle quality. To me, the best puzzles are NP-complete
(although some good puzzles are in P, relying on gaps in human
intuition rather than on computational complexity for their
difficulty). Some puzzles are even harder than NP (for instance,
sliding block puzzles and Sokoban are PSPACE-complete) but to me
this means only that the problem can have an annoyingly long
sequence of manipulations in its solution. For two-player games,
one encounters a similar phenomenon at a higher level of
complexity. The tree of potential interactions in a game typically
gives rise to PSPACE-completeness results of a sort I find more
interesting than PSPACE-completeness in puzzles. However some games
are harder, EXPTIME-complete, which to me means that it may
sometimes be necessary for a well-played game to go on for a
tediously long sequence of moves. Perhaps some games or puzzles in
which the players start with incomplete knowledge of the game or
puzzle configuration might lead to other types of completeness
(e.g. MA-completeness or #P-completeness) for finding the starting
move most likely to succeed, but I know of no such results.</p>

<p>I primarily list here real games and puzzles, games that were
invented to be played, rather than to be analyzed. So I'm not
including some of the more artificial entries in e.g. <i>WW</i> or
<i>GJ</i>, such as "sequential truth assignment". If someone can
point me to a tournament for these games, a copy of the game sold
in stores, or a program for people to play them against their
computers, I'll consider adding them.</p>

<p>One caveat: NP-completeness is not a concept that applies to a
single puzzle or game position, or even a finite collection of
positions. It only makes sense to talk about an infinite family of
problems as being NP-complete. For this reason games like chess
cannot themselves be NP-complete, as they only have a finite
(albeit unthinkably large) number of possible positions. In many
cases however there is a natural generalization from some finite
game or puzzle to an infinite family of game positions on
arbitrarily large game boards, in which it makes sense to talk
about NP-completeness. The fact that these infinite generalizations
are computationally hard gives us some justification for believing
that the original finite games are also hard in some less
well-defined sense.</p>

<a name="amazons"><h2>Amazons</h2></a>

<blockquote>Description: Players move queens on an n*n board, as part of
each move shooting an arrow from the moved piece.  Arrows move like a chess
queen when shot but are immovable afterwards.  The arrows eventually
block the movement of the queens; the last player to complete a move
wins.  Game-play combines go-like goals of surrounding territory with
chess-like tactics of blocking opposing pieces' lines of play.
The most commonly used starting configuration involves four queens of
each color placed around the edges of a 10*10 board.

<p>Status: PSPACE-complete.  Endgames in which pieces of opposing colors
are separated from each other are NP-hard.</p>

<a name="checkers"><h2>Checkers and Draughts</h2></a>

<blockquote>Description: Players move pieces diagonally forward one
square at a time on alternating squares of an n*n board, removing
the other players' pieces by jumping diagonally over them. Object
is to leave opponent with no move by blocking or jumping all
pieces. The 8*8 version is called checkers, but on larger boards it
is called draughts.

<blockquote>Description: This game is both too complicated and too
well-known to describe here in detail, but the basic idea is to
move pieces around an 8*8 board, capturing one's opponents' pieces,
until the game is ended either by checkmate (one player winning by
forcing the capture of the opposing player's king) or by various
kinds of draws.

<blockquote>Description: In these puzzles, also known as
alphametics, a sequence of letters is arranged in the form of an
arithmetic problem, a famous example being 

<pre>

The problem is to construct a 1-1 mapping from letters to digits

<a name="dots"><h2>Dots and boxes</h2></a>

<blockquote>Description: This childhood game is played with pencil
and paper, starting from a drawing of a rectangular lattice of
dots. The players alternately connect adjacent dots with line
segments; if a player forms a four-segment square he or she scores
a point and gets another move. 

<p>Status: <i>WW</i> describes a generalized version of the game
that is NP-hard, by a reduction from finding many vertex-disjoint
cycles in graphs. The same result would seem to apply as well to
positions from the actual game, by specializing their reduction to
trivalent planar graphs. (This is very closely related to, but not
quite the same as, maximum independent sets in maximal planar
graphs.)</p>

<a name="cubic"><h2>Cubic</h2></a>

<blockquote>Description: Something of a cross between
<a href="#sok">Sokoban</a> and
<a href="#samegame">Same Game</a>,
this puzzle involves pushing blocks left or right in a polygonal region,
where they are subject to a gravity that pulls them downward whenever possible.
Blocks have colors, and when multiple blocks of the same color
become adjacent, they vanish.  The goal is to eliminate all blocks.

<p>Status: Friedman claims to prove that Cubic is NP-complete.
His reduction clearly shows that it is NP-hard, but it is less
obvious to me that it is in NP.</p>

<blockquote>Description: 15 of the 16 positions in a 4*4 matrix are
filled by tiles, leaving one unfilled hole. Tiles adjoining the
hole can be shifted into the hole, the object being to form some
particular permutation of the tiles (typically forming a picture
out of fragments printed on the tiles). 

<p>Status: this is a finite problem, but can easily be generalized
to n*n matrices. Testing whether a solution exists is in P but
finding the solution with the fewest moves is NP-complete.</p>

<a name="go"><h2>Go</h2></a>

<blockquote>Description: This ancient game is played by placing
stones on a 19*19 board. When a group of stones of one color is
completely surrounded by stones of the other color, the surrounded
group is removed from the board. The object is to control empty
squares by surrounding them; after both players are unwilling to
continue play, these squares are counted and the scores adjusted by
the numbers of stones that had been removed. 

<p>Status: This is a finite game, but can be generalized to n*n
boards. Even without ko (special rules related to repetition of
positions) the game is PSPACE-hard; with ko (Japanese rules) it is EXPTIME-complete.
It is apparently still open whether Chinese or US rules Go is EXPTIME-complete.
Even certain "simple" endgames in which the go board has been
decomposed into many small independent regions of play are
PSPACE-hard.</p>

two opposite sides of the board, and aims to connect those sides by
a contiguous path of pieces. 

<p>Status: First player wins by a strategy-stealing argument but

<a name="mastermind"><h2>Mastermind</h2></a>

<blockquote>Description: One player sets up a secret configuration of
colored pins, and the other player makes a sequence of guesses about the
configuration.  After each guess, the player with the secret tells the
other player how many many pins are correct and how many are the correct color
but in the incorrect position.  The object is to make as few guesses as
possible.

<p>Status: Since this game relies on secret information, it can be
treated using classical game theory, but the relevant payoff matrices
are so large as to make computation with them intractible.
Finding a solution compatible with the guesses made so far is
NP-complete; the complexity of determining whether such a solution is
unique, or of playing either side of the game optimally, remain open.</p>

<a name="shang"><h2>Shanghai</h2></a>

<blockquote>Description: This solitaire game is played with
Mah-Jongg tiles, which (like playing cards) can be arranged in
groups of four similar or identical tiles. The tiles are placed
randomly face-up into stacks, forming some particular shape (most
computer solitaire implementations include several shapes of
varying difficulty). Only the top tile of a stack is visible,
although some shapes involve tiles partially covered by other tiles
which can be seen but not removed. The object is to remove matching
pairs of uncovered tiles until all tiles have been removed. 

<p>Status: NP-complete even if all tile positions are known.
PSPACE-hard even to approximate the strategy with maximum
probability of success when some tiles are covered and
unknown. #P-complete to count solutions (personal communication from
Michiel de Bondt).</p>

<p>Proof (of NP-completeness): reduction from 3-SAT. (Joint with Michiel de Bondt; an earlier reduction listed here until early 2016 was not valid.)
We have a different type of tile for each variable, clause, and term
(appearance of a variable in a clause) of the 3-SAT instance, with four
copies of each type of tile. We arrange these into stacks of the
following types:</p>
<ul>
<li>A big stack with three layers. The top and bottom layers each
include one copy of each variable tile. The middle layer includes one
copy of each clause tile.</li>
<li>For each term, a stack with two copies of that term on top of a tile for the clause in which the term appears.</li>
<li>For each variable, two stacks, each with a variable tile on top of a
stack of term tiles. One of these stacks has two copies of each term
tile in which the variable tile appears positively, and the other stack
has two copies of each term tile in which the variable appears
negatively.</li>
</ul>
<p>The variable tiles can only be matched by pairing one tile from the
big stack with one tile from one of the two term stacks. If this pairing
is done according to a satisfying assignment, it will then be possible
to match the term tiles from all of the chosen variable stacks, freeing
at least one copy of each clause tile. The freed clause tiles can then
be used to complete the pairing of the big stack, which in turn allows
the remaining variable, term, and clause tiles to be paired. On the
other hand, if there is no satisfying assignment, then there is no way
of freeing one copy of each clause gadget, and the problem cannot be
solved.</p>
