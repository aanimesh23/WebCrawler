GraphTool for Windows is a powerful 32-bit application for editing
graphs and visualizing the execution and results of graph algorithms.
It runs under both Windows '95 and the upcoming Windows NT 4.0.
Its key features are:
<UL>
<LI>Creating graphs with vertices, straight-line edges, multi-edges,
and self-loops.
<LI>Modifying the appearance and values of individual vertices
and edges through easy dialog boxes.
<LI>Manipulating the positions of vertices in groups or individually.
<LI>Zooming and scrolling which lets you view just the
parts of the graph you want to see.
<LI>Cutting, copying, and pasting between applications.
<LI>Printing your results to any Windows printer.
<LI>Exporting your graph as a TPIC file for inclusion in your LATEX
papers.
<LI>Running algorithm PLUG-INs, which let you visualize the execution
and results of graph algorithms.
<LI>Separate crash protection for PLUG-INs prevents the loss of
data in GraphTool. 
</UL>

<P>
Best of all, GraphTool is completely free! It is not an evaluation
version, and does not require payment or donation to receive the
complete package. Everything you need is here.<BR>

<H3>Downloading &amp; Installing GraphTool for Windows</H3>

<P>
Complete the following steps, below, to install GraphTool for
Windows.  It will require approximately 7 MB of free hard disk
space.  This installation includes all of the manuals that you
will need to use GraphTool.
<OL>
<LI>Create the directory C:\GraphTool, using whatever method you
like.
<LI>Click on the link titled: &quot;Download GraphTool for Windows,&quot;
below.
<LI>If your Internet browser has a viewer configured for .zip
files, downloading will begin immediately.  Otherwise you will
be asked how you want to handle the file.  Select &quot;Save to
Disk&quot; and select the directory C:\GraphTool.
<LI>Using your favorite Windows '95 ZIP decompressor (we recommend
WinZip '95), decompress the contents of graphtool.zip into the
directory C:\GraphTool.  <I>IMPORTANT:  </I>Make sure your ZIP
program supports LONG FILE NAMES!
<LI>Create a new shortcut to GraphTool in your Programs folder
(i.e. Start <TT>-&gt;</TT> Programs).  See the steps below if
you have forgotten how to do this.
<LI>Congratulations, installation should be complete!  You can now
print the manuals and run GraphTool for Windows.
</OL>

<H3>Development Tools </H3>

<P>
<A HREF="/~dillenco/graphtool/windows/graphtoolsdk.zip">GraphTool SDK</A>--This
is a collection of four C++ files that define the GraphTool Plug-In
interface. If you would like to write your own GraphTool Plug-Ins,
you will need this code. Note: This code requires that you have
access to the Win32 header files, and can create a Win32 console
application. This code has been tested with: Microsoft Visual
C++ 4.0. 
<H3>Algorithm Plug-Ins </H3>

<P>
This section lists the plug-ins currently available for GraphTool
for Windows. This list will change often, so be sure to check
back. Also, if you have written any algorithms for GraphTool (using
the GraphTool SDK) that you would like to share, send email to
jcahill@ics.uci.edu, and I will incorporate them here, with full
credit to you!
