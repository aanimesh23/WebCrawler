To install the LineUp program, first change directory into the lineup 
directory, and then enter

perl ./install.pl


Any error messages will be written to the screen. The gcc compiler gives 
the following known error message, which do not affect the function of 
the program. If you see any other error messages, then there may be a problem.

lineup.c: In function `read_data':
lineup.c:271: warning: unknown escape sequence `\)'
lineup.c:279: warning: unknown escape sequence `\)'
lineup.c:290: warning: unknown escape sequence `\)'


The install.pl script will create the executable version of the C program, 
and will set some perl variables.

The input format is a text file with one line per marker name. A line starts 
with the marker name followed by at least one space, and then the map 
position(s) of the marker in brackets in the format 
marker (pos chr, pos chr, pos chr). e.g.

php20554 (322 9)
umc1465 (236.6 2)
mmp20 (84.8 6)
bnl6.32 (968 1)
lim228 (947.2 1)
rz444c (95.4 1, 102.6 6)
umc1197(cat3) (675.4 4)

If you already have your map data in a MySQL table you can use the 
lineup_input.pl script to create an input file from the MySQL table. 
You will probably need to edit this script so that the column names 
are correct for your table format.

The ONLY line you should edit is the following:

$st = "SELECT marker,chr,cM  FROM $table";

replace 'marker' with the name of the column that holds the gene or marker name

replace 'chr' with the column that holds the chromosome information

replace 'cM' with the column that holds the map position information.

Please note that it does not matter if your data are bp positions, 
rank order positions, cM positions, or any other map unit.


########################

To run the program enter

./lineup.pl

This is a perl script which provides a more comfortable interface to the 
C program and the results parsers.

If you opt to have MySQL output, the results file will end .mysql, and 
you can send this into your mysql database with the command

mysql -p databasename < basename.mysql

replacing the databasename and basename.mysql as appropriate.



If you opt to have plain text output, there will be two output files

1) basename_overview.txt - summary information for each run found

2) basename_detail.txt - details of the individual markers in each run
