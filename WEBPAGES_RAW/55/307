<h1>Theoretical Models and Solutions for Problems in Computer Science</h1>

<h2>Presented by John Augustine</h2>

<p>
Abstract:
<p>
Several fundamental problems in computer science have elegant solutions.
In many cases, the problems are modeled theoretically and the solutions
are analyzed rigorously. We present our results in a manner that
highlights this research process involved in solving computer science
problems.
<P>
The problem of powering down is encountered when any energy intensive
system goes through an idle period of time. Many systems are designed
with  different  levels of  sleep states that consume energy at
different rates and have different power-up costs. We initiate this
study by presenting several models that are increasingly more accurate
in capturing the essence of the problem. Along with these models, we
introduce the notion of competitive ratio, which is the theoretical
framework for analyzing online algorithms and present an algorithm that
is provably within a small error factor of the best possible competitive
ratio.
<P>
We will conclude with a summary of other previous work and a plan for
future research in collaboration with undergraduate students.
